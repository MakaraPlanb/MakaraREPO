00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:51,182
Well, [laughs]
if you're into pleather.

168
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,707
[Abby] Hello, there.
Hi, Coco Chanel.

169
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,060
Go back to Mandi, go on.
Go, go, go.

170
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,976
- All right, just a little bit.
- [dog yipping]

171
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:07,024
- [growls]
- [Mandi] Where's Coco Chanel?

172
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,983
[barking]

173
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,941
Bad little girl.

174
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:16,947
- [sighs]
- [cell phone rings]

175
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,646
- [dog vomits, barks]
- [gasps]

176
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:23,388
[gasping]
Oh, my God! Who did that?

177
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,695
- Who fed Coco Chanel?
- [girl] It was Abby.

178
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:29,090
- [boy] Abby did it.
- You? Again?

179
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:34,748
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I'm really sorry, Mandi!

180
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,793
I'll buy you another purse.

181
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,447
Or you can just have mine.

182
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,405
Is that what I think it is?

183
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:43,147
- Uh-oh, duck.
- I love ducks.

184
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:45,933
It's, um,
the Prada fringe purse.

185
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,718
My dad got it for me
last month, but...

186
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:53,114
Last month? Ugh, just go!

187
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:58,119
- [grunts] Aah!
- [all] Oh!

188
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:01,252
Stay down there,
and don't ever look at me again.

189
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:05,256
Better yet, don't even
breathe the same air.

190
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:13,264
[dog whimpering, barking]

191
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:27,017
Hey. Well, how was it?

192
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,933
I saw a girl become
roadkill in the cafeteria.

193
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,805
Gotta love high school.

194
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:35,112
Speaking of my escape,
has my Carnegie Mellon application arrived?

195
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,114
Hey, you know,
I was lookin' today,

196
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:40,814
and I saw that the University of Ohio
has a great architectural program.

197
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,816
You could stay close to home,

198
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:47,298
transform Toledo into an
architectural wonderland.

199
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,910
Dad, what's going on?

200
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,564
I'm applying early decision
to Carnegie Mellon.

201
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,349
Eh, what do you wanna
go there for, huh?

202
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:57,831
They don't even have a good mascot.
I mean, a Scottish terrier.

203
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:59,484
Who's gonna be
intimidated by that?

204
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,878
Plus, you, uh...

205
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,925
You qualify
for in-state tuition here.

206
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,492
Oh, my God.

207
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,669
What happened to my tuition?!

208
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:16,850
Aw, Jo...
Look, I'm sorry.

209
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,895
I kept hoping that
the market would rebound,

210
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:22,507
but my investments are in the tank,
and now NASCAR sponsors have cut spending...

211
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,988
Then make them
un-cut spending!

212
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,904
Mom went to Carnegie Mellon,
I... I have to go there.

213
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:31,125
- She loved it!
- I know, I know.

214
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,301
I'm sorry I let you down.

215
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:39,873
I know you're disappointed,
Jo, and that's OK.

216
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,877
Honey, you don't always
have to be so strong.

217
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:48,969
[Jo] Strong?
I was trying not to panic.

218
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:51,493
But when you've moved
as much as I have,

219
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:56,411
you kinda get attached to the idea of
settling down in one place for four years.

220
00:11:56,454 --> 00:12:00,110
In this case,
my mother's alma mater.

221
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:04,245
My dad and I have been
on our own for a long time.

222
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,638
My mom died before I was one.

223
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:11,774
So life wasn't exactly your typical
warm and fuzzy greeting card.

224
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:16,344
But I wasn't the only one
in my own personal hell.

225
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:19,913
Abby was hoping that her
swollen, black ankle

226
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:24,787
might be enough for Mandi to forget
about her dog's infamous upchuck.

227
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,444
And it might have been,

228
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:32,926
if not for the
two's long history.

229
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,581
Jealousy is a funny thing.

230
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,410
They had lived across
from each other for years.

231
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:43,371
And while Mandi, seemingly,
had everything,

232
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,460
Abby had more.
She had two parents

233
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:48,637
who went a little overboard
for their darling Abby.

234
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,076
First, there was the infamous
moon bounce war at age five.

235
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,296
Mandi's was cool,

236
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:58,342
but Abby's
was three stories high.

237
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,562
Yay!

238
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,827
[Jo] Then, the French
Revolution Halloween meltdown

239
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,437
at age 11.

240
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,745
Mandi flaunted her
store-bought peasant costume,

241
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,574
until she spotted Abby's
utterly perfect,

242
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:16,491
hand-stitched,
Marie Antoinette royal gown.

243
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:23,672
And finally, the great bra
incident of junior high.

244
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:26,109
- Hi, Mandi.
- Hi.

245
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:29,678
[Jo] Well, that had more
to do with nature.

246
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:33,116
Still, Mandi might have
found someone else to hate,

247
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,946
if Abby hadn't
done the unthinkable.

248
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,083
Mandi, oh, my God! Someone has
a better parking space than us.

249
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:46,826
Hey, babe, who snagged
the plush disabled spot?

250
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,828
I guess you're number two now.

251
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,569
Two? Two?

252
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:54,485
[Jo] Mandi hated
being number two.

253
00:13:56,183 --> 00:14:01,188
- This is war.
- Oh, God.

254
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,933
- Elliot, we need a little favor.
- Sure.

255
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:10,197
- Chastity.
- [groans softly]

256
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,896
- Hey.
- Anything.

257
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,985
- You're on the Web team, right?
- Of course.

258
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,900
Trained in Java and C++.

259
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:21,164
I also have my Math Club Card,
Hacker Membership, Journalist Pass,

260
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:25,995
- and I do a little salsa for the ladies.
- Oh!

261
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,562
How can I be of service?

262
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:33,002
- Oops.
- [laughter]

263
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:36,571
- Sorry.
- Oh, gross!

264
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:41,445
Abby Scabby's face looks as red and
pussy as it did in seventh grade.

265
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:43,273
Zit cream much?

266
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:47,582
[Jo] Mandi was creative,
ruthless, unrelenting.

267
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:51,978
- I'd seen her kind before.
- Need a napkin?

268
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:01,901
[Jo] And this was
just the beginning.

269
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,425
[cell phone rings]

270
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:06,122
Brutal.

271
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:15,131
You know, most girls would have laughed,
texted back or posted a status update.

272
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:17,525
Do I look like most girls?

273
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:21,224
[school bell rings]

274
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:24,097
- [thudding]
- [laughing]

275
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,190
Oh, God.

276
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,931
[boy] What a paint job!

277
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,588
[laughter continues]

278
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,940
Need another one?

279
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:50,036
Hey, Abby, let me
give you a ride home.

280
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,386
I don't bite.

281
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:08,315
- Nice house.
- Thanks.

282
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:19,282
Abby? Honey, what's wrong?

283
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:37,953
- May I help you?
- Oh, hi.

284
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,565
I gave Abby a ride home from
school, and she dropped this.

285
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,090
What happened to Abby's car?
Did she have an accident?

286
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,135
She had an accident,
didn't she? Was she hurt?

287
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:50,139
No, it wasn't an accident.
It was just some girls at school.

288
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:53,621
Again? I knew we should have
sent her to St. Mary's.

289
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:58,191
Right. Well, tell Abby,
Jo said goodbye.

290
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,197
She's a wreck.

291
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,113
Our poor baby, she keeps saying
that everybody hates her.

292
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:10,116
I'll buy her some new clothes,
a week at a spa.

293
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:12,422
Money's not gonna
fix this, Sidney.

294
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:16,339
She's sobbing her eyes out,
and I don't know what to do.

295
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:19,429
If only she had some friends.

296
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,443
Listen, Jo, she's devastated.

297
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:37,360
But it's her senior year,
and I want it to be perfect.

298
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,449
I mean,
just look at that face.

299
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,756
She needs you. We need you.

300
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,410
And we're willing to pay.

301
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:47,370
- What?
- For you to be her friend.

302
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:50,547
Two, three, 4,000
to get you started.

303
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,115
- You're crazy.
- Wait, please.

304
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,248
I have more money
than I know what to do with.

305
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,120
And if I can't buy my daughter's happiness,
then what is it worth?

306
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:02,472
- You can't buy friends.
- OK. Don't call it a friend.

307
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:08,565
Call it her bodyguard,
guardian angel, fairy god-sister.

308
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,567
There must be
something you want.

309
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:13,135
Some dream I can
help come true.

310
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:17,444
A new car?
A trip to Europe? College?

311
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:21,404
College.

312
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:24,320
Today's economy,
it's rough out there.

313
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:29,108
You need money for college,
and it isn't cheap.

314
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,892
- Let me pay for yours.
- Forget it.

315
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,590
Look, just try it out
for 30 days, risk-free.

316
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,810
I guarantee you'll
be happy you did.

317
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:39,205
And just for trying, I'll buy your
college books for freshman year,

318
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:44,210
which are yours to keep, no questions asked,
as my little gift to you.

319
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,518
[Jo] Sidney
was pretty convincing,

320
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,520
and I should have
realized why.

321
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,132
He was the king
of infomercials.

322
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:56,918
He could sell anything from
meat juicers to cat toilets

323
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:58,963
to my college tuition.

324
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,400
I knew it was crazy.

325
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:02,619
But Abby'd have
a good senior year,

326
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:06,797
and I'd get my dream of
Carnegie Mellon University.

327
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,454
I figured, who would it hurt?

328
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:12,760
[pop music plays]

329
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,370
Four hundred people
already viewed it.

330
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,764
That computer geek
lived up to his promise.

331
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:20,289
Which is like a rarity in life,
that anyone ever comes through.

332
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,204
Especially fathers and doctors.

333
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,554
Not my legs,
Chastity, my face.

334
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:28,906
Getting all
red and splotchy. Ugh.

335
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,386
- Uh-oh.
- What?

336
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,867
You're never
gonna believe this.

337
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,390
What do you mean?

338
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:37,176
Someone posted a link on
your page to another video.

339
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:41,397
Look, it's that new girl, Jo.
She totally bailed Abby out.

340
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:45,793
Ugh, who is this girl?
Some bad-ass biker chick?

341
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:49,231
- There's tons of comments.
- Ugh.

342
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:53,844
- All the guys think she's hot.
- OK.

343
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,847
So she's hot.

344
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,675
She's well-connected.

345
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,330
I mean, she's
pretty much one of us.

346
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,593
So we'll just need
to make it very clear that,

347
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:07,293
from here on out, she's only
nice to the people we like.

348
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:10,731
- Agreed?
- [machine revving]

349
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,869
Mandi, can I get a quote
from you on the school play,

350
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:21,263
or the lacrosse team, or just,
like, anything, really?

351
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:24,658
God, I am not up for the
paparazzi this morning.

352
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:30,272
It's so embarrassing
how much they love me.

353
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:33,623
I'm Mandi, with an "I."
And you're Jo, right?

354
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,365
- That's me.
- So, Jo, since you're new here,

355
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:39,803
I thought we'd help you out,
let you know who to hang out with.

356
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:43,111
- Us.
- [Jo] The real welcoming committee had arrived.

357
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:46,419
- And who not to.
- [Jo] Did I say "welcoming?"

358
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:50,771
Uh, oh, wow.

359
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,468
Thanks.

360
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:54,949
But I think I can
figure that out on my own.

361
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:59,258
Really? Well, I... I haven't
been impressed so far.

362
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:02,086
- [Jo] Excuse me?
- But I'm a benevolent dictator,

363
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,961
so why don't we discuss over a non-fat,
no-sugar raspberry Frappuccino

364
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:09,659
- at the coffee joint?
- We only use Skinny-and-Sweet.

365
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,985
It's like cellulite in a straw,
but without the cellulite.

366
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,969
As scientifically interesting
as that sounds,

367
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,492
I'll have to pass.

368
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:19,582
Oh, it wasn't a question.
[chuckles]

369
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:23,543
Oops. Guess I answered anyway.

370
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,763
Oh, my God. Hi.

371
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:29,592
I'm Quinn Shinn,
editor of the school paper.

372
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:33,596
That was unbelievable.
Nobody turns Mandi down.

373
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,991
- I just didn't feel like going.
- You're kidding, right?

374
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:41,212
No, the Plastics are goddesses.
And Mandi can, like, ruin you.

375
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,519
I wrote one article
on school uniforms,

376
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:46,392
and she put strawberries
in my yogurt.

377
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,132
How horrible for you?

378
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,961
Oh, I had an allergic reaction
to the strawberries,

379
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:55,314
swelled up like a big Arothron
hispidus. That's a blowfish.

380
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,881
Be careful, Jo.

381
00:21:57,925 --> 00:22:01,320
Thanks, but I'm
not that worried.

382
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,633
[Jo] Hey, what's up?

383
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:13,636
So you dropped your notebook,
but I gave it back to your dad.

384
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,465
Pretty cool sketches.
Are you an artist?

385
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:20,817
[stammering] Look, it's cool, I get it.
You don't have to...

386
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:24,038
- Get what?
- Principal Duvall sent you.

387
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:27,128
But look, the welcoming committee
was just a stupid idea.

388
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:29,739
I mean, really, you're the first
new student here in ages,

389
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,351
so you're off the hook.

390
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,876
- Thanks for the ride, though.
- Sure.

391
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:43,362
Registration
for AP test has closed.

392
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,233
Now...

393
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:48,410
Uh, now, we all know the
tradition here at North Shore

394
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:52,762
is to, uh, use
the Homecoming Dance...

395
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:57,027
...to fund-raise
for charity, OK?

396
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:01,989
'Cause otherwise you all
would just the think

397
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:04,513
the world revolves around
you and football.

398
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:08,038
And it doesn't, OK?

399
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,692
I told you not to walk
in front of...

400
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:12,303
Babe, I already chose your
tuxedo, rented the limo and...

401
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:15,350
Oh, red rose corsage,
not a frigging carnation.

402
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,485
- Mandi, you are so winning Homecoming Queen.
- Totally winning.

403
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:22,618
[Duvall]...the school nurse will
be heading up the blood drive,

404
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:24,577
- so sign up for that now.
- [laughs] Please.

405
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,103
Like I'm letting that petri dish
of a clinic stick a needle in me.

406
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:31,888
[girl] I know!
And no matter what I said...

407
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:36,371
- Hey, uh, do you know where I could catch the bus?
- I think it just left.

408
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:40,070
Classic. This is why I really
need to fix my bike today.

409
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:44,684
Do you know any good auto parts shops?
I've gotta get a new spark plug.

410
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:48,818
Well, I... I think there's Pete's
Auto right next to the coffee joint.

411
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,820
I could give you
a ride if you want.

412
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,344
I mean, I really
owe you one anyway.

413
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,738
Sweet, thanks.

414
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:05,182
Oh, look, it's Jo!
Hey, Jo!

415
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:10,318
- Hey.
- She's with Abby Hanover!

416
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,972
Hi.

417
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,513
[Jo] Thanks for the lift.

418
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,951
Do you wanna come inside?

419
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:39,173
I'll probably break something,
but... but sure.

420
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,750
- Who's that?
- Um, my mom.

421
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,580
She's really pretty.

422
00:24:57,321 --> 00:25:01,674
Yeah. She was.

423
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:07,114
- What are these?
- Um...

424
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:11,684
That's the Sydney Harbor Bridge and
a skyscraper I've been designing.

425
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:14,600
Kind of hard to tell,
I'm a crappy artist.

426
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:17,341
- I could help, if you want.
- Really?

427
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:20,954
Uh, you're pretty talented,
based on those sketches I saw.

428
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:23,347
You should see
my paintings sometime.

429
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:26,350
Uh, actually, you don't have to.
It's a bad idea...

430
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:29,745
No, that'd be really cool.

431
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:33,575
OK. You ready to
go change a spark plug?

432
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:38,058
[rhythm and blues
plays on radio]

433
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,586
My gosh,
is that a friend?

434
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,283
Maybe you were right.

435
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,938
Girls aren't
so bad after all.

436
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,812
Hello, Mr. Winkle!

437
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:57,512
Are those illegal parts? I'll bet
you're running a chop shop over there.

438
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,560
Well, I've installed security cameras,
and I'll be watching you.

439
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:06,042
- You hear?
- Goodbye, Mr. Winkle.

440
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,060
Jo Mitchell, you have
no idea how scary I can be.

441
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:38,335
Hey, Abby! How are you?

442
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:41,164
- Ah!
- [laughter]

443
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,993
- I can't get up!
- Are you all right?

444
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:46,909
I don't know.
Pull me as hard as you can.

445
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,345
OK.

446
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,609
[grunting]

447
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:56,658
- Now what?
- Uh, help me up.

448
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,268
OK.

449
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:03,578
[Jo] Seriously? Who would ever think of something so childish,

450
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,277
yet brilliant,
except a bunch of mean girls?

451
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:10,977
- [boy] Hey, Mandi.
- [Mandi] Hi.

452
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:18,288
- Now, what do we do?
- [Jo] I would've strangled her right there...

453
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:19,638
Meet me in the bathroom.

454
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,031
Bring any spare clothes
that you have.

455
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,773
[Jo]...if I could
get off the Vespa.

456
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:30,039
Wow. Bad-ass!

457
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,694
- So cool.
- [rock music plays]

458
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,783
Coming through!

459
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:38,918
Sorry!

460
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,311
[girl] Are you OK?

461
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:43,966
This is all my fault.

462
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,378
You should've never
hung out with me.

463
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,230
Mandi's gonna make
your life a living hell.

464
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:49,189
Abby, you can't live in fear.

465
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:52,888
- Did you find me something to wear?
- Just my art smock.

466
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:56,065
[Jo] That'll have to do.
Thanks.

467
00:27:57,371 --> 00:28:01,201
- Do you need my help?
- I think I got it.

468
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,987
- How do I look?
- Great.

469
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:08,730
- [yells on screen]
- [laughter]

470
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,514
- Hey, nice look.
- It's not funny.

471
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,823
- I'm not joking, it's hot.
- Thanks.

472
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:22,831
[Duvall on PA] No unauthorized videos
of my students on the monitor.

473
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:27,444
[Jo] By the next day, I hoped everyone would
have forgotten about my wardrobe malfunction,

474
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,925
but it wasn't
what I was expecting.

475
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:35,017
Apparently, holding your head high after
a Mandi vendetta earned you points.

476
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,596
- Oh, my gosh, this is so cool!
- You started it.

477
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:50,772
It was your smock.

478
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:57,126
- It's cute.
- It's pathetic.

479
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:01,957
I could smear paint all over my Versace,
but I have taste, style.

480
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:04,264
They're just sheep.

481
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:07,920
Chastity, make out with the student intern
in the front office, get Jo's file.

482
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:09,965
Hope, stalk her.

483
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:13,186
I want to know everything.

484
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:15,014
[scoffs]

485
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:26,329
Wow, this is amazing.

486
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:29,419
You shouldn't waste your
talent on sketches for me.

487
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,944
Oh, I don't mind.

488
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:33,443
All right, what
should we work on first?

489
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,948
Um, well, I love
building cars with my dad,

490
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:40,517
but I wanna... I wanna design
something more lasting and permanent.

491
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:44,347
I.M. Pei, for instance,
designs the most amazing buildings,

492
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:47,263
- and Joseph Strauss...
- Built the Golden Gate Bridge.

493
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:51,093
Yeah, my family went there last summer.
It's pretty awesome.

494
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:55,619
- Well, then, why don't we start with San Francisco?
- All right, cool.

495
00:29:55,663 --> 00:30:00,189
Oh, um, yeah, and if my dad
asks, this is a school project.

496
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,975
He thinks artists are,
like, homeless hippies, so...

497
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:05,847
- I don't wanna get you in trouble.

Uh, today's your lucky day.
We got a sale going on.

665
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:54,549
- Twenty percent off all grade changes.
- Look, just leave me alone.

666
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:57,378
Look, I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry, OK?

667
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,249
I was clouded by lust.

668
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:04,385
And if it helps, I got kicked off
the Web team for abuse of power.

669
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:06,344
You're still a jerk.

670
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,434
At least your shirt's funny.

671
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:21,489
Nice fight in the cafeteria.
I could smell the testosterone.

672
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,361
Does this mean I'm forgiven?

673
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:26,842
Well, it's not your fault that
your dad married Mandi's mom.

674
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:30,759
But next time, warn me
that you live with Mandi

675
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:33,371
in a totally platonic way.

676
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:36,417
Wait, you thought...?

677
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,114
Dude, gross!

678
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:41,074
[Jo] But despite Quinn
and Abby's urging,

679
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:43,424
I refused to stoop
to Mandi's level.

680
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:49,038
Besides, I was having so much fun with
my new friends, I almost didn't care.

681
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:50,866
You coming?

682
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:55,958
Who are those girls?
Do they even go to our school?

683
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,802
I was just looking
at the Homecoming Web site,

684
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,875
and everybody's talking
about the hot, new couple.

685
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:03,444
Nick and I are the
hottest couple in school.

686
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:05,664
Not anymore.

687
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:19,982
[Jo] So this was it,
the first challenge.

688
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:22,289
Success was worth 100 points,

689
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:26,859
and I needed every point I could
get to qualify for the scholarship.

690
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:33,474
Boiled egg in the structure.
No breaks, no bruises.

691
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:36,477
- Ready?
- Ready.

692
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:39,088
And... drop!

693
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:46,052
[Giamatti] OK, who
switched the eggs?

694
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:48,794
Who? No one?

695
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:56,758
Oh, well. Who's next?

696
00:40:56,802 --> 00:41:00,762
[Jo] Mandi had found a new part of my life to destroy:

697
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:04,244
my chance at the
Thomson-Bird scholarship.

698
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:07,465
Our next experiment
didn't go much better.

699
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:09,989
- You ready?
- Yeah.

700
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:14,341
Hope called her doctor
on speed dial

701
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:18,563
and switched our CO2
for laughing gas.

702
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,702
[all] Whoa!

703
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:39,366
Hey, guys, I'm here.

704
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,673
Seriously, Chastity?

705
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:44,502
I said "incognito",
not "like a flamingo"!

706
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:47,156
- Oh.
- Go.

707
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:55,425
Ew! Ew! Ew! There's poo
on my Jimmy Choo!

708
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:57,427
Shake it off, shake it off.

709
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:59,647
Go, slow.

710
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:01,997
Faster!

711
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,351
Uh, I can't go any further.

712
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:10,919
What is the matter with you?

713
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,018
Funnel.

714
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:24,585
The funnel!

715
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:26,935
- Oh, there you go.
- Right. Secret weapon?

716
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:30,722
- Oh!
- Hope, a fanny pack, never OK.

717
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:48,304
Coffee?

718
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:03,145
Perfect.

719
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:26,081
- Dad, what's going on?
- It's ruined.

720
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:29,607
- The whole motor is gummed up.
- What? What happened?

721
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,914
- It was running perfectly yesterday.
- I don't know.

722
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:36,701
I don't know, maybe
it's the fuel, a faulty part.

723
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:40,922
It doesn't matter because Jimmy and the
boys are expecting a trial run tomorrow.

724
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,664
Dad...

725
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:46,188
We can figure something out.

726
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:49,670
There's not enough time,
and there's not enough money.

727
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:55,676
Maybe I can call in a favor,
uh, beg for an extension,

728
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,374
tell 'em it was some kind of
fluke accident, I don't know.

729
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:22,834
[Jo] But this was
definitely no accident.

730
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:25,575
Mandi had gone too far.

731
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,447
Mess with me, fine.

732
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,884
Mess with my family...

733
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:32,278
...you're dead.

734
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:36,761
It was as if all my girl hormones
had kicked into overdrive,

735
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:39,720
and I was out for blood.

736
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:41,330
The Plastics were going down,

737
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:44,986
and I didn't care
what rules I had to break...

738
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,119
...to make her pay.

739
00:44:51,036 --> 00:44:54,126
- What happened?
- Mandi happened.

740
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:57,912
Is that all you got?

741
00:44:57,956 --> 00:45:02,395
Going after my dad, you spoiled,
narcissistic bitch!

742
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:06,355
That's his job,
not some play-toy for you!

743
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:08,401
- But it was so much fun.
- [chuckles]

744
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:12,927
The way I figure it, no job,
no income, no house, no JoJo.

745
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:16,714
- Right?
- I don't run away that easy.

746
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:19,499
Get over yourself, man-hands.

747
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:21,544
You're just a passing phase.

748
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,198
I'm here for the long run.

749
00:45:27,986 --> 00:45:32,077
Oh, yeah?
Are you sure about that?

750
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,386
[chuckles]

751
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:43,741
Ooh! Coffee?

752
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:55,665
Abby, you don't need
to do this with me.

753
00:45:55,709 --> 00:46:00,148
Of course I do.
It's what best friends are for.

754
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:08,243
There's something
I need to tell you.

755
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:13,161
[Jo] This was it,
the moment to tell Abby

756
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:17,557
I'd made a deal with her father that I totally regretted,

757
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,429
and beg for forgiveness.

758
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:22,257
But looking at her,

759
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:25,086
the idea of losing my first
best friend in a long time,

760
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,261
I couldn't do it.

761
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:30,091
So, what do you
need to tell me?

762
00:46:32,137 --> 00:46:36,097
I, um...

763
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:40,928
You should know, my
last BFF relationship

764
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,887
crashed and burned.

765
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,151
She became snobby
and judgmental

766
00:46:46,194 --> 00:46:49,371
and used guys
as pawns of warfare,

767
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:51,896
which is saying a lot,
considering it was fourth grade.

768
00:46:51,939 --> 00:46:56,335
[laughs] Geez!
Sounds like a mini-Mandi.

769
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:58,946
- But don't worry, we're nothing like that.
- [laughs]

770
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:02,080
Success! OK.

771
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:05,779
I grabbed all the archived
papers with the Plastics,

772
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,826
which was pretty much
every issue.

773
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:12,481
- If there's dirt, we'll find it.
- What's this?

774
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:17,573
Mandi's Annual Birthday Bash.
Everybody wants to be invited.

775
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:21,926
But, of course, they aren't. Mandi never
allows anybody to throw a party when she does.

776
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:25,016
Is that so?

777
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,633
[Mandi] I am so excited.

778
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:36,549
Tonight is gonna
be the perfect night.

779
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:40,466
It should be.
It's costing my dad enough.

780
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:42,598
Our dad, Tyler.

781
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:45,036
You know, most people
would die to be my brother.

782
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:48,909
That's only because they don't
know what you're really like.

783
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:52,043
You mean perfect,
awesome and popular?

784
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:56,699
More like conceited,
vain and vindictive.

785
00:47:56,743 --> 00:47:59,398
You're only happy when
making others miserable.

786
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:01,313
But high school
will end, Mandi.

787
00:48:01,356 --> 00:48:03,968
And then what
will you have left?

788
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:15,631
This is a bad idea.
Nobody's gonna show up.

789
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:18,939
Of course they will. Who wants
to go to some expensive party

790
00:48:18,983 --> 00:48:21,072
with cocktail dresses
and raw fish,

791
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:23,901
where Mandi talks
about how awesome she is?

792
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,338
People who think
Mandi's awesome.

793
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:28,427
[sighs] No one
actually thinks that.

794
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,865
Trust me, it's just years
of social brainwashing.

795
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,954
- [knocks]
- Ooh!

796
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:37,088
Wait, why aren't
you guys ready? Huh?

797
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:41,962
- People will arrive any minute!
- We are ready.

798
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:43,964
No! No!

799
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:45,661
- Abby, no! Honey!
- [moans] Mom...

800
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:48,229
I bought you all those
party clothes for a reason.

801
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:51,667
Now you don't have an excuse,
because you're actually the host.

802
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,105
Huh? Come on. Come on, come on!
Come on, let's go.

803
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:56,324
- Come on, sugar, let's go!
- [sighs]

804
00:48:56,368 --> 00:49:01,155
Come on! My little girl
is throwing a party! [giggles]

805
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:06,334
- Seriously?
- Mom, stop.

806
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:09,772
Now, Jo, you know you're not gonna
have this little body forever.

807
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:13,037
- Mom!
- I'm just saying she oughta show it off.

808
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,953
- Mom, just stop!
- In something like this.

809
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:18,781
- Ugh! Ilene Hanover!
- Definitely.

810
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:21,436
[giggles] I knew it!

811
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:31,620
- Invitation, miss?
- I don't have one.

812
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:34,014
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
it's invite only.

813
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,237
Okay.

814
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:48,811
Thank you, thank you all so much
for coming to my birth...

00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:52,163

816
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:55,340

Believe it.

This party rocks! [laughs]
Only where's the food?

828
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:38,426
Oh, I heard Mandi's
serving nigiri sushi.

829
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:42,039
- That's sushi.
- Pizza's coming.

830
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:45,172
Pizza.

831
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:48,175
This is a disaster
of epic proportions!

832
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:50,699
I mean,
don't panic, Mandi.

01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:37,024
inviting everybody
to join our group,

1004
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:38,939
there won't be any room left.

1005
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:42,639
At least Mandi understood
the importance of exclusivity.

1006
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:45,685
Someone has to be
the proletariat.

1007
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:48,688
That's lower class.

1008
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:50,298
[grunts]

1009
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:57,044
Hey, kid.
Lend me a hand, huh?

1010
01:00:57,088 --> 01:01:00,134
Jimmy gave me an extension
on delivering the engine.

1011
01:01:00,178 --> 01:01:01,570
Um, sorry, Dad.

1012
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:04,051
I've got shopping with Quinn
and a movie with Tyler,

1013
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:07,272
and I still have
to make my campaign buttons.

1014
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:09,317
Busy, busy!

1015
01:01:13,321 --> 01:01:15,062
Busy, busy.

1016
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:18,370
- [boy] Hey, Jo.
- Hi.

1017
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:19,893
- Hey!
- Hi.

1018
01:01:19,937 --> 01:01:21,808
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

1019
01:01:21,852 --> 01:01:24,724
- What's up?
- Hi.

1020
01:01:26,857 --> 01:01:28,336
I wonder how much
sugar is in this.

1021
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,296
- You did not just ask that.
- What?

1022
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:34,778
Jo, you ate, like,
two funnel cakes, a hot dog

1023
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:37,084
and a bag of kettle corn
on our first date.

1024
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:41,088
And you didn't wear
these crazy studded boots.

1025
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:49,793
Come on.
You're kidding me, right?

1026
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:52,839
- Using me to make Chastity jealous?
- Look, I was just...

1027
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:55,494
Starting to act a hell
of a lot like Mandi,

1028
01:01:55,537 --> 01:01:58,018
which is not the kind of
girl I want to be dating.

1029
01:01:58,062 --> 01:02:01,021
Hey, I am nothing like Mandi.

1030
01:02:01,065 --> 01:02:05,547
Oh, really? Running
for queen, humiliating people,

1031
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:09,116
using their secrets against them, dressing
like you're on the cover of Rolling Stone,

1032
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,119
which, OK, it's kinda hot sometimes,
but not the part

1033
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:15,862
where you suddenly care about
what everyone else thinks.

1034
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:19,474
Jo...

1035
01:02:19,518 --> 01:02:22,869
What happened to that girl
I met in shop class?

1036
01:02:26,351 --> 01:02:27,918
[scoffs]

1037
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,152
[Jo] And when I got home,
there it was,

1038
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:48,155
waiting for me:
my future.

1039
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:50,418
How had I almost forgotten?

1040
01:02:57,643 --> 01:02:59,776
The fat letter!

1041
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:03,431
- It's good news, right?
- The best.

1042
01:03:04,911 --> 01:03:07,174
Ah, Jo. Look, honey,

1043
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:10,699
I feel lousy
about your tuition fund.

1044
01:03:10,743 --> 01:03:13,354
But, honey, that doesn't mean
that you shouldn't be excited.

1045
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:16,401
I mean, CMU, that's...
that's big stuff!

1046
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:19,099
And if I can just get
this engine finished,

1047
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:21,841
or... what about that
architectural scholarship?

1048
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:23,277
The scholarship.

1049
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:25,410
[Jo] But somehow,
all this campaigning

1050
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:28,805
and preening and plotting
had gotten in the way.

1051
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:32,460
I didn't even know what my grade
was in shop class anymore.

1052
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,987
Oh, hey, I almost forgot. Um...

1053
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,294
Abby's dad dropped
this off for ya.

1054
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:42,229
So does she know where
she's goin' to college yet?

1055
01:03:42,253 --> 01:03:46,474
Um, Abby wants art school, but
her dad's more of a pre-med guy.

1056
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:50,870
Well, just make sure that she knows that to,
um, to win the race...

1057
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,090
You gotta be in the race.

1058
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:07,495
[Jo] But what if I wanted out?

1059
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:09,236
What if I wanted
to forfeit the race

1060
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,022
because I didn't
deserve to win?

1061
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:17,854
Got something
that's real revolutionary.

1062
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:20,160
It's gonna revolutionize
your gardening experience.

1063
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:22,989
[Jo] Hey, Mr. Hanover.

1064
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:24,619
Abby's not home
from the movie yet, is she?

1065
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:27,472
[Mr. Hanover] No,
thought you'd be with 'em.

1066
01:04:27,515 --> 01:04:33,260
- But glad you're here.
- Listen, Mr. Hanover, I...

1067
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:37,656
- I brought back the money.
- Jo, what, are you crazy?

1068
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:40,746
The money's for you, every damn penny.
You've earned it.

1069
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:44,968
Hiring you to be her friend was
the best money we've ever spent.

1070
01:04:45,011 --> 01:04:49,059
Please, Mr. Hanover,
I can't.

1071
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:52,192
Jo, I'm sending it
right back to you.

1072
01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:54,716
I'd give a bonus,
if I gave them.

1073
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,283
Which I don't.

1074
01:05:09,253 --> 01:05:13,257
Is it true? Did my dad pay
you to be friends with me?

1075
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:16,913
Quinn finally
got her big story.

1076
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:19,002
She quoted Mandi
as a witness.

1077
01:05:19,045 --> 01:05:21,004
Why would Quinn do this?

1078
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:24,007
How could you?

1079
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:27,401
- I was gonna tell Abby everything.
- Face it, Jo.

1080
01:05:27,445 --> 01:05:29,273
The Plastics
are the originals,

1081
01:05:29,316 --> 01:05:32,058
and they don't have to pay
anyone to be their friend.

1082
01:05:32,102 --> 01:05:34,931
No! You just sold out
your friends for free!

1083
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:36,671
Oh, what,
like you sold me out?

1084
01:05:36,715 --> 01:05:39,022
[sobbing] God, I trusted you.

1085
01:05:39,065 --> 01:05:42,068
You know what?
You go to hell, Jo Mitchell.

1086
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:43,591
I wish I never even met you.

1087
01:06:26,156 --> 01:06:29,028
[Chastity] Just
to see their faces.

1088
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:32,292
You were so good, Mandi.
I totally voted for you.

1089
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:34,947
- It's too bad this didn't come out earlier.
- Why?

1090
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,385
Well, from what I hear, Jo is
a shoo-in for Homecoming Queen.

1091
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:40,474
It's too late for people
to change their votes.

1092
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:46,132
- That is, if she's eligible.
- Eligibility is based on matriculation.

1093
01:06:46,176 --> 01:06:51,572
- So she'd have to be expelled or something.
- Oh.

1094
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:55,533
Wouldn't that be a tragedy?

1095
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:14,856
[Nick] This is gonna be
the best senior prank ever.

1096
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,380
The best.

1097
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:21,820
OK, so tell me again
why we don't keep the money?

1098
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:24,692
- That's a lot of money.
- Then there's no dance,

1099
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:27,565
and if there's no dance,
I'm not the queen.

1100
01:07:28,696 --> 01:07:31,177
I don't know.

1101
01:07:31,221 --> 01:07:34,050
[sighs] Money can't do this.

1102
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:44,625
[engine revving]

1103
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:47,628
As many of you know,
we had a robbery last night.

1104
01:07:47,672 --> 01:07:52,024
Now, the evidence strongly
suggests that the thief

1105
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:56,463
was a student, because of his wanton disregard for school property.

1106
01:07:56,507 --> 01:08:00,076
This student, or students,
clearly degenerates,

1107
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:04,341
stole the money that was
intended for helpless animals.

1108
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:06,386
Now, unless
the money is returned,

1109
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:11,391
I have no choice but to cancel the Homecoming Dance.

1110
01:08:11,435 --> 01:08:15,091
- [all muttering]
- This is your principal,

1111
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:16,788
signing off for today,

1112
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:21,097
reminding you to stay left
or right, not center.

1113
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:31,237
Miss Mitchell, I received an anonymous
tip today that you stole the money.

1114
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:34,893
That's a lie.
I would never do that.

1115
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:36,242
Well, apparently you did.

1116
01:08:36,286 --> 01:08:39,506
We had a policeman go
to your shed this afternoon.

1117
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:43,597
And I'm afraid we
found the stolen money.

1118
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:46,513
- How did that get there?
- I didn't steal it, I swear!

1119
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:49,125
Somebody must've
put it there, and...

1120
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:50,952
I would bet anything
it was Mandi.

1121
01:08:50,996 --> 01:08:54,434
Well, now, Miss Weatherly
may be the spawn of Satan,

1122
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:55,870
but unless you have proof,

1123
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:58,177
there's nothing I can do
except expel you.

1124
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:01,441
[Jo] It officially
couldn't get much worse.

1125
01:09:01,485 --> 01:09:05,315
I'm also sorry to say that I'm gonna
have to report this to Carnegie Mellon,

1126
01:09:05,358 --> 01:09:07,795
and they very well may
rescind your admission.

1127
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,800
Miss Mitchell, where are
you going? Come back here!

1128
01:09:12,844 --> 01:09:14,684
- Did you hear about Jo?
- I can't believe it.

1129
01:09:14,715 --> 01:09:16,543
- What a fake.
- I knew it.

1130
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:20,286
I knew it all along,
and I tried to warn people.

1131
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,767
I tried to protect
you all from her.

1132
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:25,857
- Mandi, you are like a saint.
- Yeah, a total saint.

1133
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,426
- Oh, yeah, a real martyr.
- You mean a real bitch!

1134
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:33,169
Wait. As much as we all might like that,
I can't let it happen.

1135
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:36,824
This is crazy! Shouldn't she be
locked up in juvie or something?

1136
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:38,739
Girls, why don't we
settle this like ladies...

1137
01:09:38,783 --> 01:09:40,828
Screw being ladies,
and screw being girls!

1138
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:44,484
I'm sick of the mind games and
the backstabbing and the set-ups.

1139
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:47,618
I know you framed me, Mandi.

1140
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:52,275
So we're gonna settle this
like men, on the battlefield.

1141
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:54,755
- Oh, please.
- That's right.

1142
01:09:54,799 --> 01:09:56,192
I challenge you...

1143
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,503
...to a football game,

1144
01:10:03,547 --> 01:10:06,332
- Powder Puff style.
- No way.

1145
01:10:06,376 --> 01:10:08,856
I... I don't do sports.

1146
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,337
Aw, you scared?

1147
01:10:11,381 --> 01:10:14,601
Can't take the heat, Mandi?

1148
01:10:14,645 --> 01:10:17,213
I thought you were
the best at everything.

1149
01:10:17,256 --> 01:10:22,218
I thought people trembled in
the presence of the Plastics.

1150
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:23,915
You wanna win?

1151
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:29,312
The only way you're gonna
become queen is by default.

1152
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:36,841
Fine, you're on.

1153
01:10:36,884 --> 01:10:39,191
But be prepared to lose.

1154
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,238
You know, you
and your team of one.

1155
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:54,554
[Jo] I realized a little too late
that I no longer had any friends.

1156
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:59,777
But if I had to take on all the
Plastics by myself, I would.

1157
01:11:07,175 --> 01:11:10,657
All right, let's get to class, everybody... 
Hang out in the hallway.

1158
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:14,095
- Do you really think she did it?
- I don't know anymore.

1159
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:15,923
Certainly not about Jo.

1160
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:32,375
Hey, Mr. Hanover, this was in our mailbox.
It's for you.

1161
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:36,030
- Listen, you're Jo's boyfriend, right?
- Ex-boyfriend.

1162
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:39,338
Huh, awkward.

1163
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:41,795
Thing is, I've got something for Jo.
It's the money, actually.

1164
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:45,649
Would you give it to her? A deal's a deal.
It's not her fault Abby found out.

1165
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:51,350
- She gave the money back to you?
- Of course.

1166
01:11:51,394 --> 01:11:53,047
I was expecting it, really.

1167
01:11:53,091 --> 01:11:55,354
I knew she'd love Abby
once she got to know her.

1168
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:57,008
I just needed
to make that happen.

1169
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:59,073
So remember, you can't wear
red or pink to the dance.

1170
01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:00,988
Those are my colors.
And I'm wearing my hair up,

1171
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:03,884
'cause it's best for the crown,
so wear yours down.

1172
01:12:03,928 --> 01:12:08,367
- Quinn, are you listening?
- Yes, absolutely. Hair down.

1173
01:12:12,415 --> 01:12:14,982
Hey, Abby.

1174
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:19,291
- Look, just don't.
- But...

1175
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,468
You know, Jo may
have lied to me,

1176
01:12:22,512 --> 01:12:24,427
but at least she
taught me one thing.

1177
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:28,866
Stand up for myself.
So... get lost, Quinn.

1178
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:31,738
Fine, hate me.

1179
01:12:31,782 --> 01:12:36,090
But you should know I don't
think Jo stole the money.

1180
01:12:36,134 --> 01:12:38,223
I think Mandi did.

1181
01:12:38,266 --> 01:12:41,705
- How do you know?
- Because I sort of gave her

1182
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:44,664
the idea to get Jo expelled.

1183
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:50,844
Also, Jo spent an awful lot
of time putting together

1184
01:12:50,888 --> 01:12:54,761
and sending out college
applications for you.

1185
01:12:54,805 --> 01:12:58,461
She even put together
your portfolio.

1186
01:13:00,985 --> 01:13:06,425
I helped her make about a dozen of
those with journalism equipment.

1187
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:10,821
I hope you get
into art school, Abby.

1188
01:13:10,864 --> 01:13:12,649
I really do.

1189
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,666
[grunts]

1190
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:33,583
So Mr. Hanover just called.

1191
01:13:33,626 --> 01:13:37,543
Apparently, one of his distributors
is sending new parts for the engine.

1192
01:13:38,762 --> 01:13:41,199
That's great, right?

1193
01:13:41,242 --> 01:13:45,421
We can finish the car in time
for Jimmy and the new racer.

1194
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:48,598
So, you, uh...
You heard from Abby?

1195
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:52,645
I've texted, called.

1196
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:56,127
I tried her
NorthShoreCentric page.

1197
01:13:56,170 --> 01:14:01,611
No luck. That girl
really hates my guts.

1198
01:14:01,654 --> 01:14:06,267
But I can't blame her.
I'm not sure why you don't hate me.

1199
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:11,316
Listen, kid, I'm not proud
of what you did to Abby,

1200
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:14,101
but I know
that you care about her.

1201
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:18,976
- And you're certainly not a thief.
- At least someone believes me.

1202
01:14:19,019 --> 01:14:22,370
[doors closing]

1203
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:24,938
Oh, I don't
think it's just me.

1204
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:35,471
- Am I seeing things?
- We haven't forgiven you yet.

1205
01:14:35,514 --> 01:14:37,081
Not even close.

1206
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:42,652
But we can't let you
take the fall for Mandi.

1207
01:14:42,695 --> 01:14:46,525
- That's right, we've got your back.
- Mandi's goin' down.

1208
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:48,309
- [all chuckling]
- I knew it.

1209
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:51,008
I knew Mandi set me up, and...

1210
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:54,054
...you guys came to rescue me.

1211
01:14:55,665 --> 01:14:58,363
I don't deserve you.

1212
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:00,887
Oh, my God, are you crying?

1213
01:15:00,931 --> 01:15:05,196
- No, I never cry.
- [laughs]

1214
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:09,374
All right, now come on,
we have a game to prepare for.

1215
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:12,551
And you're right,
Mandi needs her ass kicked.

1216
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:14,901
And we have an idea
to prove your innocence.

1217
01:15:37,228 --> 01:15:40,579
- Do you think you can do it?
- Hack into their security system?

1218
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:44,322
Not easy, but not impossible.
I just have to detect their wireless signal,

1219
01:15:44,365 --> 01:15:47,194
then hack into their computer
and find their security account.

1220
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:49,588
- Uh, wait, got it.
- [beeping]

1221
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:52,286
They named their Wi-Fi
"AlwaysWatching?"

1222
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,288
What's their
pass code, "“666?"”

1223
01:15:54,332 --> 01:15:57,944
It'll take a few days, but if
Mandi planted the evidence,

1224
01:15:57,988 --> 01:15:59,859
I'll find the footage.

1225
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:03,950
But... I want
something in return.

1226
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:06,126
I knew it. I knew
he wouldn't do it for free.

1227
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:08,607
What do you
want, Elliot?

1228
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:12,176
A date to the dance,
with Abby.

1229
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:19,966
Oh, um, hey, good luck at the game.
I'll be rooting for you.

1230
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,665
Uh, even got my
own side biz going on.

1231
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:25,232
Odds are 30 to one
in Mandi's favor.

1232
01:16:25,276 --> 01:16:28,584
- What? Why?
- You haven't heard?

1233
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:33,240
[Jo] Mandi had managed to recruit
the captain of the rugby team...

1234
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:38,594
...a fifth-year senior
who felt no pain...

1235
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:43,729
...and the three-time Junior Division
Karate Champion onto her team.

1236
01:16:44,774 --> 01:16:47,167
But we weren't backing down.

1237
01:16:48,473 --> 01:16:49,909
And neither was Mandi.

1238
01:16:49,953 --> 01:16:52,433
She wasn't going
to pull any punches.

1239
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:55,611
It was time to end this
once and for all.

1240
01:17:02,705 --> 01:17:05,098
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

1241
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:06,926
Good!

1242
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:09,799
Hi, baby!
Oh, you look so cute.

1243
01:17:09,842 --> 01:17:13,324
- Our little athlete.
- Mom, Dad, come on. You know you can't be in here.

1244
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:16,544
- Just go.
- You're right, you're right. We need to find a seat.

1245
01:17:16,588 --> 01:17:20,113
- The bleachers are already filling up.
- Yay! Yay!

1246
01:17:23,116 --> 01:17:27,512
- I'm gonna vomit.
- It's gonna be OK, I promise.

1247
01:17:27,555 --> 01:17:30,384
- What's the worst that could happen?
- [all] We lose?

1248
01:17:30,428 --> 01:17:33,692
- [knocking on door]
- Is everybody decent in here?

1249
01:17:33,736 --> 01:17:36,913
I don't want a sexual
harassment lawsuit... again.

1250
01:17:36,956 --> 01:17:38,479
- [all] Yeah.
- Yeah, we're good.

1251
01:17:38,523 --> 01:17:40,675
Principal Duvall, what are you
doing here on a weekend?

1252
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:43,659
Well, I've tried to turn
a blind eye to this game,

1253
01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:46,662
but the fact that you made
the challenge in my presence,

1254
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:51,057
and you've plastered the school
with posters made that kinda hard.

1255
01:17:51,101 --> 01:17:54,104
Thought you guys would wimp out.

1256
01:17:54,147 --> 01:17:56,497
But I guess now
I will have to intervene.

1257
01:17:56,541 --> 01:18:00,110
Mainly because Mandi's team
wants to file a lawsuit.

1258
01:18:00,153 --> 01:18:03,417
- What are you talking about?
- Jo, due to your expulsion,

1259
01:18:03,461 --> 01:18:05,724
you are not allowed
on school grounds.

1260
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:07,639
Thus, you cannot play the game.

1261
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:12,035
- Damn it! Mandi was counting on this.
- I know.

1262
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:15,647
- You know?
- Yep, which is why I looked into this issue days ago.

1263
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,344
You know, technically,

1264
01:18:17,388 --> 01:18:20,739
the football field is public
property since it's on park land.

1265
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:23,002
You know, the school
only rents it for games.

1266
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:27,528
So all we needed was a permit,
which I have right here.

1267
01:18:27,572 --> 01:18:30,357
Oh! Well, great then.

1268
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:34,318
I guess you are just not
allowed in the locker room.

1269
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:38,365
Oh. See ya!

1270
01:18:38,409 --> 01:18:40,977
Well, I guess my
job here is done.

1271
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,327
Ha-ha! Let's go, team!

1272
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:46,199
Kill! Maim! Dismember.

1273
01:18:46,243 --> 01:18:50,943
- [cheering]
- [booing]

1274
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,818
Whoo! Yeah!

1275
01:18:58,081 --> 01:19:01,214
- [booing]
- Yeah! Whoo!

1276
01:19:01,258 --> 01:19:03,521
- [cheering]
- Go, Abby!

1277
01:19:03,564 --> 01:19:05,653
[booing]

1278
01:19:05,697 --> 01:19:07,264
[Jo] The big day was upon us,

1279
01:19:07,307 --> 01:19:10,267
and we were going
to take the Plastics down.

1280
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,401
Come on, girls!

1281
01:19:14,445 --> 01:19:17,883
[Jo] We were ready
for anything.

1282
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,065
Didn't expect to see me here?

1283
01:19:26,109 --> 01:19:28,807
I'm still gonna
kick your team's ass.

1284
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,417
OK, girls, listen up.

1285
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:34,073
Football is a religion,
and you are now in church.

1286
01:19:34,117 --> 01:19:37,685
Do not disgrace this field.
We'll play by playground rules.

1287
01:19:37,729 --> 01:19:41,951
Fumbles that hit the ground are live balls.
Four downs and out.

1288
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:45,998
No punts, no extra points
and a touchdown is seven points.

1289
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:51,090
Get it? Got it? Good!

1290
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:53,440
We will flip a coin to see
who receives the ball.

1291
01:19:53,484 --> 01:19:55,442
- Pink Team, you call it.
- Heads.

1292
01:19:56,835 --> 01:20:00,099
- Heads it is.
- We'll receive.

1293
01:20:00,143 --> 01:20:02,798
All right, shake hands.

1294
01:20:04,974 --> 01:20:07,803
- [cheering]
- OK, then.

1295
01:20:07,846 --> 01:20:09,456
Ow!

1296
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,158
[whistle blows]

1297
01:20:18,248 --> 01:20:20,424
[cheering]

1298
01:20:20,467 --> 01:20:23,427
Run, moron, run!

1299
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:32,088
- Take it, take it.
- [whistle blows]

1300
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,222
[cheering]

1301
01:20:37,702 --> 01:20:40,400
[grunting]

1302
01:20:42,794 --> 01:20:44,491
[screaming]

1303
01:20:48,017 --> 01:20:49,496
[blowing whistle]

1304
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:52,456
- There's no nunchakus in football!
- Man.

1305
01:20:57,809 --> 01:20:59,202
Ball, now!

1306
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,988
[crowd cheering]

1307
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:05,121
[screaming]

1308
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:11,214
[whistle blowing]

1309
01:21:14,478 --> 01:21:16,219
Touchdown!

1310
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:17,873
Yay!

1311
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,918
[barks]

1312
01:21:23,487 --> 01:21:25,402
[cheering]

1313
01:21:34,454 --> 01:21:38,502
- [cheering]
- [blowing whistle]

1314
01:21:38,545 --> 01:21:40,417
[grunting]

1315
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:56,955
[grunting]

1316
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:04,093
So listen. My dad always
says to win the race,

1317
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:05,746
you've got to be in the race.

1318
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:08,532
So think of the worst thing
the Plastics have done to you,

1319
01:22:08,575 --> 01:22:10,316
and knock them down.

1320
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:13,232
If they're gonna play
full contact, so are we.

1321
01:22:13,276 --> 01:22:15,974
Fumble-rooski on two.

1322
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:18,672
- Break!
- [all] Break.

1323
01:22:18,716 --> 01:22:20,109
[man] Yeah!

1324
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:26,680
- Yay!
- Yeah, Jo!

1325
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:29,596
[father] Good job, honey!

1326
01:22:31,642 --> 01:22:35,341
What... What's goin' on?
What... What are you doing?

1327
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:37,343
- [blows whistle]
- Yes!

1328
01:22:37,387 --> 01:22:39,432
Touchdown!

1329
01:22:39,476 --> 01:22:41,478
