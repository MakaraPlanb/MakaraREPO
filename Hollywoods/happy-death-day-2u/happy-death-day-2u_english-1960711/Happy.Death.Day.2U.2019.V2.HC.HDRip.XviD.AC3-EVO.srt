00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:23,499
Good boy.

3
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:25,701
Aw.

4
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:27,403
Watch it. Watch it.

5
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:29,471
Frank, no.

6
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:35,878
Told you not to do that.

7
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,646
- Spare any change?
- Whoa! Uh, s-sorry, man.

8
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:39,548
Uh, I don't have any money.
I just...

00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,717
Yeah, right.

10
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,086
Whoa. Sorry, bro.

11
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:45,923
Watch it, man.

12
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:07,610
Hey, stop global warming?

13
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:09,044
So sorry. No speak English.

14
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,013
- Okay.
- So sorry.

15
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:12,748
Excuse me.
Would you like to sign this

16
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,884
to stop global warming?

17
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:25,561

Oh, you're taking forever!

She's back?

22
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,847
- Out.
- I'm not sleeping in my car again.

23
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,548
- It smells like Hot Pockets and feet.
- Get out.

24
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,718
I just want clean underwear.

25
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:50,986
It's my room, too.

26
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:54,590
Oh, my God. Answer me, Ryan.

27
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,626
Oh, my God.
Answer me, Ryan.

28
00:02:57,628 --> 00:02:58,994
What?

00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:00,229
Ryan, dude, oh, my God.

30
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:01,931
Get over here right now, man.
This is crazy.

31
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,599
Oh, my God.
You're not gonna believe this.

32
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,934
Fool, I understood
two percent of that.

Dude, just come now!

34
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:07,970
Where?

35
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:26,021
- Dude! Dude.
- What?

36
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:28,258
- You need to get in here right now.
- Huh?

37
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,626
- This better be good, man.
- It is.

38
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,229
Come on, come on.

.7 millinewtons of energy.

41
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:47,643
God, that's...
that's, like, huge.

42
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,945
- When?
- Uh, yesterday. 12:01 a.m.

43
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:53,015
Damn, this is crazy, man.

44
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:56,018
Yeah, but, Ryan, we have no
idea what set the device off.

45
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,920
Like, lab was locked.

46
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:59,822
It's almost like it decided
to fire on its own.

47
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:00,990
That's it! I've had it!

48
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:03,025
Oh, shit.

49
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:05,060
Hey.
Wh-Where you guys going?

50
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:07,062
- It's churro day at the cafeteria.
- Nom, nom.

51
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:08,630
Dean Bronson, hi.

52
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,899
Love the tie.
Uh, are those cats?

53
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,269
Turkish angora.
Uh, d-don't change the subject.

54
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,903
- What subject?
- That.

55
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:15,904
We've had four
rolling blackouts,

56
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,573
fried electrical circuits,

57
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:19,208
broken bulbs all over campus.

58
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,643
And it's all because of
your little science project.

59
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:24,081
- It's my thesis project.
- It's an abject failure.

60
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:28,251
This university's
science department

61
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:30,819
prides itself on pioneering

62
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,755
forward-thinking ideas
that yield results.

63
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:34,189
Results that lead to patents.

64
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,824
Do you see how it works?

65
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:36,859
So, it's just about money?

66
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,060
Yes, Mr. Phan.

67
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,728
I hate to shatter
your illusions,

68
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,365
but somebody has to keep
the lights on around here,

69
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,800
something you seem
hell-bent on stopping!

70
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,969
Literally! Consider this joke
of a project suspended,

71
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:48,037
effective immediately.

72
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,738
- What?
- That's right.

73
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,206
I've already called
Professor Boner.

74
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,174
It's pronounced "Bonner."

75
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,776
And he's in total agreement
with my request.

76
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:55,778
I'm sending security
to come and collect

77
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,213
this energy-sucking doohickey
by 6:00 today.

78
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,782
You can't just take her.

79
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,650
Watch me.
I suggest you wrap up

80
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:03,921
whatever business
you have left here, capisce?

81
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,876
Hello?

82
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:47,932
What the hell?

83
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:21,163
Hey, shit bags.

84
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:22,698
While you were off
playing games,

85
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,133
our project got shut down.

86
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,070
I hope you're happy.

87
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,133
What is wrong with you?

88
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:33,503
- Why are you sneaking up on me?
- I was bringing you a...

89
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,471
Well, now it's covered
in bacteria,

90
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:37,806
so that's two dollars wasted.

91
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,442
So ungrateful.

92
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,372
Good boy.

93
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:15,879
Frank, no.

94
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,952
Told you not to do that.

95
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:26,054
Ouch!

96
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:27,557
Dude, what's your problem?

97
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,525
I'm so sorry, man. I...

98
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:31,261
So sorry.

100
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:36,031
Sorry, bro.

You know?

111
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,664
What's it called? When you feel
like you've already

112

lived through something before.

113
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,535
- Déjà vu?
- Yes, that.

114
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:47,670

Okay. Just breathe.

121
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,016
Just breathe.

122
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,385
Listen to me.

The day reset
when you died, right?

124
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,055
Yeah. Some psycho dude
in a baby mask attacked me.

125
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:08,223
But it was just a dream, right?

126
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:10,626
- Tombs is dead.
- So is Lori.

127
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:12,928
Then who's the killer
this time?

128
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,465
Uh, hello.
Will someone please explain

129
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,369
what the hell is going on?

130
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,574
Okay. Recap.

131
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:27,008
<i>So, I was stuck
reliving the same day,</i>

132
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,513
<i>Monday the 18th,
over and over and over again</i>

133
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:32,281
<i>until someone wearing
a Bayfield Baby mask</i>

134
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,417
<i>murdered me on the night
of my birthday.</i>

135
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:35,951
I had no idea who it was

136
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:37,553
because I was
such a crazy bitch

137
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,489
<i>and so many people
hated my guts.</i>

138
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:41,959
<i>So, at Carter's suggestion,
I made a list of suspects.</i>

139
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,027
<i>Turns out it was
my roommate, Lori,</i>

140
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:47,497
<i>who kept on helping
a serial killer escape</i>

141
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:49,265
<i>from the hospital,
hoping it would look like</i>

142
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,166
<i>he murdered me when, in fact,
it was her all along,</i>

143
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:53,302
<i>and all because she was jealous
of an affair I was having</i>

144
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:55,405
<i>with my college professor,
Gregory, who was married.</i>

145
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:57,105
Yeah, I know. Pretty shitty.

146
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:58,274
But, anyways,

147
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:00,743
<i>I finally kicked Lori's
crazy ass out a window</i>

148
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:03,312
<i>and killed her, which broke
the loop, or so I thought.</i>

149
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,381
But now it only looks like
it passed the loop on to you

150
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:06,716
and you're gonna be stuck
reliving this day

151
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:08,986
until we figure out
how to stop it.

152
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,224
Of course.

153
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,394
I'm still dreaming.

154
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:20,596
Wait. What?

155
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,331
It's like <i>Inception.</i>

156
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:26,034
It's a dream within a dream.

157
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:27,235
Bro, you're not dreaming.

158
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,441
- Ryan, we...
- Shh.

159
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:33,378
I'm trying to wake myself up.

160
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:38,381
There. See? You're not dreaming.

161
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,015
Why'd you hit my penis?

162
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:41,451
Why are you acting like this?

163
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:43,084
You smacked my dick.
That's rude.

164
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,988
- I barely touched you.
- Okay.

165
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,325
Show me where you died.

166
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:02,239
Back there. Storage closet.

167
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:10,346
Hey. Give me that.

168
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:11,714
I can handle myself.

169
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:12,717
You've died enough,
haven't you?

170
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,453
Mm.

171
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,669
- Bash his head in.
- Shh! - Shh!

172
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:05,601
- Samar, you asshole!
- Why'd you hit me?

173
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:07,537
Why do you keep
sneaking up on me?

174
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:09,170
Ah, I think
my cheekbone's broken.

175
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:10,473
What is happening in here?

176
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:12,173
Ryan broke my cheekbone.

177
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:14,242
- Was it him?
- No.

178
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:16,445
He was here when I died before.

179
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:17,647
What?

180
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:19,448
Where'd you get that mask?

181
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,182
It was just laying
in the hallway.

182
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:22,687
Somebody must have dropped it.

183
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,721
That's it. I've had it.

184
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:26,689
Wait, wait.
Where you going?

185
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:28,591
- Uh, churro day at the cafeteria.
- Nom, nom.

186
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:30,393
We've had four
rolling blackouts,

187
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,361
fried electrical circuits,
broken bulbs all over campus.

188
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:35,130
And it's all because of
your little science project.

189
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:36,066
Wait.

190
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:39,702
What science project?

191
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:41,704
The Sisyphus Quantum
Cooling Reactor.

192
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:43,873
We call it Sissy for short.

193
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,641
You see all these?

194
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:47,443
They're proton lasers.

195
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:50,379
And when they fire, they cool
the centrifuge right here

196
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:52,315
to almost below one nanokelvin.

197
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:54,215
So, basically, we're trying
to prove that time

198
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:56,217
can be slowed down
on a molecular level.

199
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:58,754
It hasn't worked yet, but we
did find some promising data

200
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,156
after the device fired
the other night.

201
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:02,525
When?

202
00:14:02,527 --> 00:14:05,396
12:01 a.m. yesterday.

203
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,765
Monday the 18th.

204
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,736
Mm-hmm.

205
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:15,538
What?

206
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,208
You created the time loop,
dummy.

207
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:21,242
That's impossible.

208
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:22,878
That's not what Sissy
was designed to do.

209
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,580
I don't know what to tell you.

210
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:26,382
Well, maybe we're just
discovering

211
00:14:26,384 --> 00:14:27,717
what it actually does.

212
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,652
An unintended reaction.

213
00:14:29,654 --> 00:14:31,219
Maybe we thought
we were slowing time,

214
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:32,722
but what if we looped it
instead?

215
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:34,258
Now you're stuck in this day.

216
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,559
Congrats.

217
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:38,828
Oh, and by the way,
you're gonna die

218
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,932
again and again and again.

219
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:45,301
Carter, tell your girlfriend
to stop trying to scare me.

220
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:47,303
Oh, she's not my girlfriend.

221
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:49,472
- Well, wait, are you my girlfriend?
- Kinda.

222
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:51,407
Hey, guys, are you done talking
about your relationship status?

223
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:52,908
Because she just said
I'm gonna die.

224
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,543
And you need to figure out
how to close the loop

225
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:55,745
before the killer
finds you again.

226
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:57,446
But I don't know
how it happened.

227
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:59,815
It just fired on its own.

228
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:02,420
Oh, God.

229
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,588
Danielle, hi.

230
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,989
- Where were you?
- What do you mean?

231
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:08,624
You ditched our house meeting.

232
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,559
- It was canceled.
- When?

233
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:14,430
Um, after I kicked my murdering
roommate out of a window.

234
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,432
Exactly.
Who's gonna pledge Kappa

235
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,000
now that we have a death curse?

236
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,937
We're in crisis mode, Tree.

237
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:24,509
Ew. Who are these people?

238
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:26,509
Hi.

239
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,644
Uh, I'm-I'm-I'm Samar.

240
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:33,616
Hey, samosa,
my head's the middle one.

241
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:35,851
Anyhoo, call me
as soon as you're done

242
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,320
with your creepy little
Comic-Con meeting. Ugh.

243
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:39,889
Did she just call me "samosa"?

244
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:41,357
Yep.

245
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,925
- You think she likes samosas?
- Nope.

246
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,794
Guys, focus.
I don't want to die.

247
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:46,796
On the bright side,
you'll come back.

248
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:48,297
I died 11 times.

249
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:49,799
11? Hell no.

250
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,367
- That shit hurts.
- Wait a minute.

251
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:52,868
Guys, I have an idea.

252
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,904
We just need to find
the safest possible place

253
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:56,407
and wait it out there.

254
00:15:57,642 --> 00:15:59,209
Where?

255
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,931
What?

256
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:25,034
There's... safety in numbers.

257
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:27,636
More like hiding
in plain sight.

258
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,905
Who picks a creepy baby
for a mascot anyway?

259
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,742
I knew I should have
gone to M.I.T.

260
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:47,757
He traveled!

261
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:55,064
Airball!

262
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,368
Is that you and your mom?

263
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:00,004
That's cute.

264
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,608
I was thinking.

265
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,610
It's ironic.

266
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:09,945
Here I thought I was stuck
in the same day

267
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:12,882
for some big cosmic reason.

268
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:15,319
You know,
facing my mom's death.

269
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:19,889
It had nothing to do with her.

270
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:23,628
Turns out it was just
some big scientific fluke.

271
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:28,933
That doesn't make it mean
any less, does it?

272
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,904
I guess not.

273
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:38,641
Oh, you got a little something
right here.

274
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,009
Yep, uh, uh.

275
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:42,011
Yeah.

276
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:44,580
Sorry. It's...

277
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:47,082
You're such a grandpa.

278
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:50,354
Yeah, well,
you fell for it, so...

279
00:17:56,427 --> 00:17:58,828
Please make your way
to the nearest exit

280
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,162
in an orderly fashion.

281
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,464
This is not a drill.

282
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:04,767
Please make your way
to the nearest exit

283
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:06,435
in an orderly fashion.

284
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:08,737
Again, this is not a drill.

285
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:27,525
Hey, watch it!

286
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,495
Guys! Wait up!

287
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:44,540
Don't push me.

288
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,108
Hey, I can't find my phone.

289
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:49,981
Help! Help! Please!

290
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:52,717
Help!

291
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,589
Help!

292
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:42,057
- What was that?
- Down here!

293
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,959
Holy shit.

294
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,594
Are you okay?

295
00:20:45,596 --> 00:20:47,565
Yeah, I think so.

296
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:52,302
Well, damn. Good job.

297
00:20:52,304 --> 00:20:54,770
- I have a little practice.
- What the hell?

298
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:55,971
I thought you were the killer.

299
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:57,072
You should have said something.

300
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:58,209
I was looking for you.

301
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,577
Well, who is it?

302
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:03,781
Only one way to find out.

303
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,059
What the fu...?

304
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:24,833
You sure you...
you don't have a twin brother?

305
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:27,102
Maybe you were separated
at birth.

306
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:28,306
Of course I'm sure.

307
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,845
- Oh, shit.
- "Oh, shit" is right.

308
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:37,880
Who are you?

309
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:39,014
Who you think I am, dummy?

310
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:40,283
It's you.

311
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:41,218
- Duh.
- Duh.

312
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,186
What the hell is going on here?

313
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:46,088
Look, I was trying
to close the loop,

314
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,624
but somehow I got knocked
into a parallel time loop.

315
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:50,326
We're all in serious danger.

316
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:52,661
The longer we exist
in the same dimension,

317
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:54,163
the worse things will get.

318
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:55,164
It's a butterfly effect.

319
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,865
You have to kill him.

320
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,767
- Me?
- He's going to create bigger problems

321
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,002
if you do not stop him.

322
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:01,339
Kill him now!

323
00:22:02,706 --> 00:22:04,173
No, screw that. Kill him.

324
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,742
You're wasting your time.
Do it.

325
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:08,177
Dude, I'm your friend, not him.

326
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:10,380
Uh... you know what?
Screw this.

327
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:12,748
I'll just take care of it myself.

328
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:18,821
- Stop him.
- Wait. Ryan, maybe you should stop.

329
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:19,955
Look at him. He's crazy.

330
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:22,325
I'm the one who designed this.
I know what I'm doing.

331
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:23,959
You don't understand
what you're doing!

332
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,127
Shut up, fake Ryan!

333
00:22:27,031 --> 00:22:28,799
Ryan, this doesn't feel right.

334
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:31,700
Ryan, stop.

335
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:33,702
But a parsec is a measure
of distance, not time.

336
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:35,305
Okay, so now you're gonna call
Han Solo a liar?

337
00:22:35,307 --> 00:22:37,373
No, I'm saying
if a normal Kessel Run is...

338
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,310
Dre, help me.

339
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:41,810
Come on!

340
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:44,012
Whoa.

341
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:46,650
Dude, did you dose my Yoo-hoo again?

342
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,254
What did I tell you about
turning that thing on?

343
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:54,923
Turn it off now.
Turn it off now!

344
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:55,991
Just get him. Get him.
Get the man.

345
00:22:55,993 --> 00:22:56,859
Get him, get him, get him!

346
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:59,128
- Back off! Back...
- Whoa!

347
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,797
- Ryan, just turn it off, man.
- Ryan, what are you doing?

348
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,766
Guys, take the wrench from him.
He's a college student.

349
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:07,270
It's just a wrench.

350
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:09,171
Don't be scared of him.

351
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:10,772
Okay, all right,
just unplug it.

352
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:12,342
Unplug the machine.
Unplug it!

353
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:19,116
Whoa.

354
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:24,019
No!

355
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:31,989
Shut up!

356
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:43,165
Oh, hey. You're up.

357
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,067
Yeah, I wasn't sure if you

360

No fucking way.

361
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:04,219
Hey, I-I folded
your clothes for you.

362
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:06,991
Ryan! Get in here right now!

363
00:25:14,131 --> 00:25:16,064
Wait a minute,
you two know each other?

364
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:18,000
- Yes.
- No.

365
00:25:18,002 --> 00:25:20,836
Ryan, you dumbass!

366
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:22,472
You sent me back.

367
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:24,607
- What?
- It's Monday the 18th.

368
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:26,609
I don't believe this.

369
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:29,179
I just got out.
How could you do this to me?

370
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:32,415
Uh... who's this
crazy white girl?

371
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:36,018
Maybe it was
a-a bad dream or something.

372
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,354
You're right.
It is a bad dream.

373
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:40,022
It's a nightmare!

374
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:41,890
This sucks!

375
00:25:41,892 --> 00:25:44,092
It sucks the biggest mega balls

376
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:47,062
in the history
of shitty ball-suckery!

377
00:25:47,064 --> 00:25:50,801
It...

378
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:02,514
I'm okay.

379
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:04,946
You sure?

380
00:26:04,948 --> 00:26:07,350
Yes.

381
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:09,918
He just needs to fix this.

382
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,887
Now.

383
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:13,289
This is a joke, right?

384
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,291
I wish.

385
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:17,125
Look.

386
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:20,162
Ryan, we need to go
to your lab, turn on Sissy,

387
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:22,298
and figure out
how to send me back.

388
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,868
Uh, how do you know
about Sissy?

389
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:28,438
Oh, my God. Just...

390
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,308
Let's go.

00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:38,283

393
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:49,925
A simple "no, thanks" would do!

394
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:51,195
Sorry!

395
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:56,532

00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:17,655
You are gay.

403
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:21,591
Wait, where are you going?

404
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:23,158
The lab's back that way.

405
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,129
I have some business
to take care of first.

406
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,647
<i>You sneaky little beyatch.</i>

407
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:46,950
That's weird.

408
00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:49,352
What?

409
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:51,054
She was supposed to be here.

410
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:53,924
Who?

411
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:58,996
Uh, never mind.

412
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:02,230
She finally rolls in.

413
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:03,466
Where is it?

414
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:05,000
Where's what?

415
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:06,504
- Oh, hey, Carter.
- Hey.

416
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:10,673
Where's the cupcake?

417
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:11,774
What cupcake?

418
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:13,342
The one you made
for my birthday.

419
00:28:13,344 --> 00:28:14,510
The one you poisoned.

420
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:17,112
Oh, that cupcake.

421
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,247
I'm serious.

422
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:20,750
Look, I don't know
what stupid joke

423
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:23,486
Danielle put you up to,
but there's no cupcake.

424
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:25,254
Sorry.

425
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:27,457
All right, I got to go.
I'm pulling a double for Jen.

426
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,325
She's got the flu.

427
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:31,161
Happy birthday, though.

428
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:33,498
Toodles.

429
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:37,667
Something's wrong.

430
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:39,268
What?

431
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,338
I don't know.

432
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:44,105
It's different.

433
00:28:46,243 --> 00:28:48,678
- There were two of me?
- Yes.

434
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,713
That is how
this whole thing happened.

435
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:53,382
You know, this kind of reminds
me of <i>Back to the Future II.</i>

436
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:55,219
- Totally. Mm-hmm.
- Right?

437
00:28:56,821 --> 00:29:00,224
- You know, with Marty McFly?
- Doc?

438
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,192
- The DeLorean?
- Sorry.

439
00:29:04,194 --> 00:29:06,629
Are you serious? You've never
seen <i>Back to the Future?</i>

440
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:08,196
No, I...

441
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:10,234
- How do you...
- Wait.

442
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:13,101
Oh, my God.

443
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:14,405
Does this mean that...

444
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:18,206
Does this mean
that there are two of me?

445
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,141
I highly doubt it.

446
00:29:20,143 --> 00:29:23,111
It's almost impossible to
create a holographic universe.

447
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:25,350
You're probably stuck
in a quantum cyclic dimension.

448
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:28,718
There's only one of you here,

449
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,320
because the other you
got knocked into

450
00:29:31,322 --> 00:29:33,389
a parallel dimension
somewhere in the multiverse.

451
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:36,124
Okay, Ryan.
Thanks for clearing that up.

452
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:37,727
That was super helpful.

453
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:39,662
You never heard
the multiverse theory?

454
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:42,398
Do I look like someone
who knows what a multiverse is?

455
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,100
Okay, look.
This is our universe.

456
00:29:45,102 --> 00:29:46,435
Okay? Now, look.

457
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:49,505
In theory, the universe
has six dimensions.

458
00:29:49,507 --> 00:29:52,140
Now, if what you're saying
is true,

459
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:55,878
then maybe you woke up
on the same day...

460
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,780
but not in the same dimension.

461
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,615
That would explain
the anomalies.

462
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:02,318
So, how different
are we talking here?

463
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,619
Well, it depends.

464
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:06,722
Oh, shit.
I forgot our house meeting.

465
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:08,691
Danielle, I'm sorry. I just...

466
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:09,859
Hey, babe.

467
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:10,893
You doing all right?

468
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,637
Hi, Ry.

469
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:23,541
Hey, Danielle.

470
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,289
Did that look real?

471
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,391
I'm auditioning
for this year's production

472
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:43,726
of <i>The Miracle Worker.</i>

473
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:48,898
Did you know Anne Frank
was blind and deaf?

474
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,500
Uh... Helen Keller.

475
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:53,436
Excuse me?

476
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:55,738
Anne Frank was in the attic.

477
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,940
Oh.

478
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,575
Whatever.

479
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:01,577
All I know is acting blind

480
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:03,579
is probably harder
than actually being blind.

481
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,314
I mean, the skill set it takes.

482
00:31:05,316 --> 00:31:06,782
Meryl Streep
taped her eyelids shut

483
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:08,417
just to prepare for a role.

484
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:09,420
Uh-huh.

485
00:31:11,322 --> 00:31:14,890
Well. Somebody missed
our house meeting today.

486
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:16,892
Oh, um...

487
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:18,327
I'm sorry. I...

488
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:19,895
Totes kidding.

489
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:22,298
Birthday girls get a free pass.

490
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,634
Anyhoo, we picked
this year's charity.

491
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:26,569
Are you ready for it?

492
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:29,472
We're doing the
special needs art fair again.

493
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:31,206
Oh. Nice.

494
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,642
You do so much good, Danielle.

495
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:34,276
I-I really admire that.

496
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:36,445
Oh, please.
It just warms my heart

497
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:38,246
seeing all those little faces.

498
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:39,749
I mean, don't get me wrong.

499
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:41,617
Sometimes they try
to hug you too long,

500
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:44,219
and it gets
a little uncomfortable,

501
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:46,722
but you just get used to it.

502
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,758
And at the end of the day,

503
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,327
there is no greater gift
in life

504
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:53,331
than the love of a child.

505
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:56,701
Thank you.

506
00:31:59,871 --> 00:32:00,838
Tree?

507
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:02,840
You okay?

508
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:06,475
Uh... yeah, I...

509
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:08,511
♪ Yeah, it's my birthday

510
00:32:08,513 --> 00:32:10,780

511
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:13,582

512
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:14,884
Uh... Yeah, yeah.

513
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:16,452
Sorry. I'm on my way.

514
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:18,423
I'll be there in a little bit.

515
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:21,590
I have to go. Um...

516
00:32:21,592 --> 00:32:23,292
Wait, what?
You're leaving?

517
00:32:23,294 --> 00:32:25,761
Uh, yeah. I have to meet up
with my dad for lunch.

518
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:27,665
It's a birthday thing.

519
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:30,700
Meet me in the lab at 3:00.

520
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:33,671
We are figuring this out
before it gets any worse!

521
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,310
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

522
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:43,646
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay, sweetie.

523
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:46,282
It's just been a weird day.

524
00:32:46,284 --> 00:32:48,751
- Everything okay?
- Uh, yeah.

525
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:50,920
It's just... stuff, you know.

526
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:52,321
How's school?

527
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:53,723
Um, it's fine, Dad.

528
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:55,491
- Are you ready to order?
- Not yet.

529
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:56,625
We're still waiting
on one more.

530
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,327
One more? I...

531
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,865
Okay. I'll be right back.

532
00:33:14,846 --> 00:33:16,314
Mom.

533
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,284
Mom!

534
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,487
Whoa!

535
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:26,021
Hi.

536
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:34,497
You're here.

537
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:36,599
Oh, you're really here.

538
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:39,003
Well, of course I'm here.
It's our day.

539
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:43,706
Are you okay?

540
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,642
Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:33:46,644 --> 00:33:49,680
Oh, God, I'm fine. I'm just...

542
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:55,451
It's good to see you.

543
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:07,963
Okay.

544
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,333
Try it now.

545
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,705
20 seconds.

546
00:34:25,383 --> 00:34:26,982
Yo, is this normal?

547
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,450
Don't worry,
it's not gonna blow up again.

548
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:31,453
- Again?
- Ten. Nine.

549
00:34:31,455 --> 00:34:33,823
Eight. Seven.

550
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,591
Six. Five.

551
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:37,827
Four. Three.

552
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:38,994
Two.

553
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:40,062
Stop!

554
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:42,932
Leave it.

555
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:44,800
- You told me to...
- No, I-I know.

556
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:46,068
I changed my mind.

557
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,138
This must be
the crazy white girl.

558
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,941
Hey, Tree. Wait up.

559
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:53,909
Hey. Hey.

560
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:55,511
Why the change of heart?

561
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:57,146
- Everything's different.
- Different how?

562
00:34:57,148 --> 00:34:59,481
Wait, when were you
gonna tell me?

563
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:00,683
Tell you what?

564
00:35:00,685 --> 00:35:02,151
About Danielle.

565
00:35:02,153 --> 00:35:03,552
Yeah, what about Danielle?

566
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:05,421
Apparently you guys are dating.

567
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:07,022
Wait, I thought...
I thought you knew that.

568
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:08,991
I mean, you guys live
in the same house.

569
00:35:08,993 --> 00:35:11,694
Uh, no,
I definitely didn't know.

570
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:13,863
But the bigger question is:
does she know?

571
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:15,664
Does she know what?

572
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:18,100
One of her closest friends woke
up in your bed this morning.

573
00:35:18,102 --> 00:35:19,802
You don't think
that that's newsworthy?

574
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:21,470
Nothing happened.

575
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,072
I slept in Ryan's bed
last night.

576
00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:24,940
So, why take me home?

577
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:26,141
Because you were...
you were wasted.

578
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:27,776
I was afraid
you were gonna fall

579
00:35:27,778 --> 00:35:29,678
or choke on your own vomit
like Janis Joplin.

580
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:32,815
Okay.

581
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:35,651
It's fine. It's fine.
It's fine.

582
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:37,653
It's fine. This is how
it's supposed to be.

583
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:39,889
My mom's okay.
Lori isn't trying to kill me.

584
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:41,624
I mean, this is, like,
the better version

585
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:43,158
- of my life, right?
- What are you...?

586
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,027
She's in a sorority, Gregory.
She's...

587
00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:46,695
Wait a minute. In this...

588
00:35:46,697 --> 00:35:48,030
in this other dimension,
were we...?

589
00:35:48,032 --> 00:35:50,232
I... I can't do this right now.

590
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,970
No, Tr... Tree!

591
00:35:56,774 --> 00:35:59,475
<i>Are you ready for this?</i>

592
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:01,043
- I... No. Okay.
- Hold this.

593
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:03,712
And...

594
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:05,981
Oh, my God!

595
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:07,583
It's so weird.

596
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:09,585
Oh, my... this is amazing.

597
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:11,220
But I don't think you have
to get another one.

598
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:12,990
This is, like, the best...

599
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,058
None of these memories
are mine.

600
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:24,733
I know. I'm just borrowing it
for tonight.

601
00:36:24,735 --> 00:36:26,235
What time you going
to the party?

602
00:36:26,237 --> 00:36:29,571
Um... I, uh... I can't make it.

603
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:31,075
- Something came up.
- What?

604
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,076
I mean,

605
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:35,978
we've been planning this
for weeks, Tree.

606
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,247
No, I know. And I know
it's a surprise party.

607
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:40,049
I'm sorry. It's just...

608
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:42,785
You know, my parents
are in town, and I need to...

609
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:44,920
Ugh.
Our tuition dollars at work.

610
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,991
Anyhoo, who told you
about the surprise?

611
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:51,226
Was it Lori?

612
00:36:51,228 --> 00:36:53,662
I swear, that girl really needs
to learn how to keep a secret.

613
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:54,863
I don't know
what's going on with you...

614
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:56,198
You know what, Tree, I'm just
gonna come out and say it.

615
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,734
I have been feeling
so extremely

616
00:36:58,736 --> 00:37:00,169
- unappreciated by you...
- ...following a deadly shootout

617
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:02,071
- this morning that left one officer dead.
- Hello?

618
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:03,872
- I'm still talking to you.
- Tombs was the subject

619
00:37:03,874 --> 00:37:04,707
of a nationwide manhunt

620
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:07,009
that ended after
a five-month pursuit

621
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:10,179
across four state lines
that left six female victims.

622
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:11,947
Oh, my God.

623
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:13,884
He's still here.

624
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:19,755
He's going to escape!
Call the police!

625
00:37:19,757 --> 00:37:21,757
- Who?
- John Tombs. Just call the police.

626
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:23,659
- What?
- Wait! Don't go in there!

627
00:37:23,661 --> 00:37:25,027
Shit.

628
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:26,097
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

629
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:09,772
Whoa. Drop the ax.

630
00:38:09,774 --> 00:38:11,242
- Wait. I can expl...
- Drop it now.

631
00:38:12,943 --> 00:38:14,777
He's escaped.
He's gonna kill someone.

632
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:16,879
- Face up against the wall.
- No, you don't understand. Lori...

633
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:17,848
I'm not asking again.

634
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:26,855
Please listen to me.

635
00:38:26,857 --> 00:38:28,657
My roommate works here.

636
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:31,026
She set Tombs free because
she's trying to blame him,

637
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:32,661
but she's gonna kill me.

638
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:34,963
I don't know what kind
of shit you're on, lady,

639
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:36,799
but Tombs is down
in the O.R. right now.

640
00:38:36,801 --> 00:38:38,133
Nurse just took him.

641
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:39,868
Was she tall,
dark hair and a ponytail?

642
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,870
- Ow!
- Let's go.

643
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:44,139
I know you think I'm crazy,
but you got to believe me.

644
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:46,108
Dispatch,
this is Officer Conrow.

645
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,910
Have an 11-55
at the hospital.

646
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:49,312
Need immediate assistance.

647
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:04,628
Come on.

648
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:11,267
I know it's you, Lori!

649
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:12,835
What? Oh, my God!

650
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:17,273
Oh, my God.
I thought you were the...

651
00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:19,141
Are you okay?
What the hell is going on?

652
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:21,143
- Who was that?
- Tombs escaped. He's trying to kill me.

653
00:39:21,145 --> 00:39:22,345
No, Tree, that's not possible.

654
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:24,046
I just took him down
to the O.R.

655
00:39:27,818 --> 00:39:29,051
What's happening?

656
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:30,288
I-I don't know.

657
00:39:31,956 --> 00:39:33,222
Oh, my God, he cut the power.

658
00:39:33,224 --> 00:39:34,959
Just stay calm.

659
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,296
Just stay calm. Shit!

660
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:43,067
Okay. Come on.

661
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:53,811
Come on.

662
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:01,417
Where the hell are we?

663
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:04,987
This must be one of the floors
under construction.

664
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:08,260
Come on. There's an emergency
exit on the other end.

665
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:16,098
Wait.

666
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,235
Grab that.

667
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:29,347
Okay.

668
00:40:30,448 --> 00:40:32,116
Come on.

669
00:41:04,316 --> 00:41:06,251
What?

670
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:09,920
Did you hear something?

671
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:29,539
All right, asshole,
let's see what you got.

672
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:46,888
Ha!

673
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,192
Shit!

674
00:42:06,378 --> 00:42:08,045
Shut up!

675
00:42:10,014 --> 00:42:12,448
Rookie move, Tree.

676
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,517
Oh, hey. You're up.

677
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:17,320
- What dimension am I in?
- Huh?

678
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:19,121
Danielle.

679
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:20,323
Uh, my girlfriend?

680
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:22,057
Same one.

681
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:24,226
- ♪ Yeah, it's my birthday
- Okay.

682
00:42:24,228 --> 00:42:25,861
♪ And I ain't gotta
pick up the pho... ♪

683
00:42:27,064 --> 00:42:28,331
Are you okay?

684
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,032
Yeah.

685
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:31,135
Never better.

686
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,003
Hey, I folded your clothes
for you, so...

687
00:42:35,005 --> 00:42:38,173
Look, no offense, but how could
you possibly end up with her?

688
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:39,542
With who?

689
00:42:39,544 --> 00:42:41,109
Danielle.

690
00:42:41,111 --> 00:42:42,978
Uh, uh, she's nice.

691
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,013
Oh, "nice."

692
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:46,214
Wait a minute.

693
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:47,883
Isn't she, like,
your best friend?

694
00:42:47,885 --> 00:42:49,853
Dude, did you hit
that fine vagine or wha...?

695
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,124
- Huh. Interesting.
- No, I wasn't trying to do any...

696
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:58,226
- Not as innocent as you look.
- But...

697
00:42:58,228 --> 00:43:00,496
- What? No, I-I...
- You.

698
00:43:00,498 --> 00:43:02,598
Meet me in your lab in an hour.

699
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,400
Huh?

700
00:43:04,402 --> 00:43:06,904
I've got to get out
of these disgusting clothes.

701
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:10,340
Listen to me carefully.

702
00:43:10,342 --> 00:43:14,076
I need to stay here
in this dimension.

703
00:43:14,078 --> 00:43:15,678
Okay? So just close the loop.

704
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,547
Look, we have no idea

705
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:19,515
how this even happened
in the first place.

706
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:23,118
Well, you're all brainy
science people, right?

707
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,320
So you'll figure it out.

708
00:43:24,322 --> 00:43:26,088
You realize we're messing

709
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,190
with things we have
no business touching, right?

710
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:29,925
Well, maybe you should have
thought of that

711
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:31,296
before you built
the big dumb thing.

712
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:39,268
Just...
just please do me a favor

713
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,472
and try to figure this out,
okay?

714
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:44,540
Please.

715
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:47,610
Look, this is gonna be
a trial-and-error situation.

716
00:43:47,612 --> 00:43:49,445
We have to rule out
every variable

717
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:51,481
in order to narrow down
the correct algorithm

718
00:43:51,483 --> 00:43:52,715
that will close the loop.

719
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:55,318
- Okay.
- Uh, it's days,

720
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,519
maybe weeks of work.

721
00:43:56,521 --> 00:43:58,254
And if what you're saying
is true,

722
00:43:58,256 --> 00:44:00,390
there's no way to keep
a record of our progress.

723
00:44:00,392 --> 00:44:02,092
I'm not following.

724
00:44:03,193 --> 00:44:05,062
Okay. Um...

725
00:44:06,498 --> 00:44:11,701
Say we test, like,
dozens of variables.

726
00:44:11,703 --> 00:44:14,236
By the end of the day,
the loop will reset, right?

727
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:17,975
So everything we learned
gets...

728
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:21,477
...erased.

729
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:24,179
There's no way for us
to track our progress

730
00:44:24,181 --> 00:44:26,682
simply because we just don't
remember anything we learned.

731
00:44:26,684 --> 00:44:28,518
And we'll be back
to square one.

732
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,655
Great.

733
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:35,225
I'm screwed.

734
00:44:39,163 --> 00:44:41,664
Wait, no, I got it.

735
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:44,367
Okay, you said everything
resets but your memory, right?

736
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:46,436
- Yeah.
- All right, well, then...

737
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:48,304
you're just gonna have
to be a living record.

738
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:53,776
Wait, you mean memorize
everything?

739
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:56,612
- Yeah.
- That's genius.

740
00:44:56,614 --> 00:44:58,514
- Yeah.
- No. No, no, no, no.

741
00:44:58,516 --> 00:45:01,784
That's not genius.
I'm not a scientist.

742
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:03,719
And hello.
I mean, you do realize

743
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:05,455
there's a killer after me,
right?

744
00:45:05,457 --> 00:45:07,356
That means I'm gonna have
to die over and over again

745
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:09,661
until you guys figure out
how to close the loop.

746
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:14,229
I mean, I guess you could just
kill yourself

747
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:16,332
before they find you.

748
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:18,668
Wow. Another genius idea.

749
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,405
Um, better than being chased by
some crazy guy in a baby mask.

750
00:45:26,678 --> 00:45:28,413
I mean, do you have
a better idea?

751
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:34,283

Yep. Never better.

824
00:49:13,971 --> 00:49:16,505
I don't know if you remember
my name or not.

825
00:49:16,507 --> 00:49:18,507

pretty wasted last night.

00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:20,009

00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:21,310

00:49:21,312 --> 00:49:22,778
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

829
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,381
You're looking kind of pale.

830
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:27,351
No, I'm fine. I...

831
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:30,653
Mm.

832
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:33,422
Actually, I'm probably
gonna pass out.

833
00:49:33,424 --> 00:49:35,491
What?

834
00:49:35,493 --> 00:49:37,693
- Yep. Definitely passing out.
- What? No, uh...

835
00:49:37,695 --> 00:49:39,729
You hit that fine vagine
or what?

836
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:41,664
Is she dead?

837
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:43,367
- Ryan, little help here, man.
- Oh, okay.

838
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:53,876
Hey, hey. It's okay.

839
00:49:53,878 --> 00:49:55,945
It's just me.

840
00:49:55,947 --> 00:49:57,847
Hey.

841
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:00,082
You okay? You really gave me
a scare back there.

842
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:01,919
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

843
00:50:04,822 --> 00:50:06,789
You still came.

844
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:07,890
Yeah, of course.

845
00:50:07,892 --> 00:50:09,058
Why wouldn't I?

846
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,826
Oh, we got a hold
of your parents.

847
00:50:10,828 --> 00:50:12,661
They're on their way.

848
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:15,331
No. They can't come here.
It's not safe.

849
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:16,734
What are you talking about?

850
00:50:18,803 --> 00:50:19,802
Jesus.

851
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:21,971
Can I help you?

852
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:23,908
Oh, it's okay. He's a friend.

853
00:50:25,476 --> 00:50:27,643
Sorry.
Visiting hours are over.

854
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:29,445
Oh.

855
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:31,847
All right. Well...

856
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:32,984
Thanks, Carter.

857
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:35,887
Yeah. Feel better.

858
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,726
So, I guess now you know why
I wasn't in your class today.

859
00:50:43,728 --> 00:50:44,727
Pardon?

860
00:50:44,729 --> 00:50:46,629
Advanced bio.

861
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:48,831
Uh, I'm sorry.

862
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,733
Are you in my class?

863
00:50:50,735 --> 00:50:52,470
You don't look familiar.

864
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,706
I'm sorry.

865
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:59,408
My mistake.

866
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,609
Right.

867
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:02,413
Well, I'm Dr. Butler.

868
00:51:03,548 --> 00:51:05,047
Nice to meet you.

869
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:07,550
Ms. Gelbman,
I've been having a hard time

870
00:51:07,552 --> 00:51:09,051
pulling up
your medical records.

871
00:51:09,053 --> 00:51:10,653
I know. I should be dead.

872
00:51:10,655 --> 00:51:13,455
My results,
they don't make sense, right?

873
00:51:13,457 --> 00:51:15,090
Yes.

874
00:51:15,092 --> 00:51:17,092
They're highly alarming,
to be honest.

875
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:18,561
Wait.

876
00:51:18,563 --> 00:51:19,795
What time is it?

877
00:51:19,797 --> 00:51:21,497
Uh, it's almost 9:30.

878
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:23,065
- Why?
- She's about to die.

879
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:24,500
- Who?
- Lori.

880
00:51:24,502 --> 00:51:26,435
- He's gonna kill her.
- What?

881
00:51:26,437 --> 00:51:29,505
Listen to me. You need to stop
her from going down to the O.R.

882
00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:31,807
I'm sorry. I don't know
who you're talking about.

883
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:34,011
Oh, really?
Well, maybe your wife does.

884
00:51:35,746 --> 00:51:37,882
Go. Go!

885
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,545
Sorry.

886
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,675
Lori.

887
00:53:59,857 --> 00:54:02,560
Who set you free?

888
00:54:12,236 --> 00:54:13,904
Who are you?

889
00:54:17,675 --> 00:54:18,841
Fine.

890
00:54:18,843 --> 00:54:21,579
I go, you go.

891
00:54:28,353 --> 00:54:30,052
Oh, hey. You're up.

892
00:54:30,054 --> 00:54:31,820
I wasn't sure if you wanted
to sleep in or not.

893
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:32,988
Shut up!

894
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:36,225
I am so done with this shit.

895
00:54:36,227 --> 00:54:38,827
Then you multiplied
the Euclidean vector

896
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:41,964
by the square root of pi
to the 17th power,

897
00:54:41,966 --> 00:54:46,602
which then gives us
an axon point of .004,

898
00:54:46,604 --> 00:54:49,104
which then gives us

899
00:54:49,106 --> 00:54:52,207
a linear plane vector of 8.2.

900
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:56,645
Boom.

901
00:54:56,647 --> 00:54:57,882
Damn.

902
00:55:06,023 --> 00:55:09,992
Well, if these are all
the failed algorithms...

903
00:55:09,994 --> 00:55:13,164
Then there's only one
possibility left.

904
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,110
- Holy shit balls. You did it.
- Oh, oh!

905
00:55:28,112 --> 00:55:29,711
- What? It worked?
- Yes, yes, yes.

906
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:31,314
It worked?
Oh, my God, it worked!

907
00:55:33,285 --> 00:55:34,917
We did it!

908
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:36,885
Why are we so excited?
We barely know her.

909
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:38,321
Honestly, I-I don't know
what just happened,

910
00:55:38,323 --> 00:55:40,055
but that was impressive.

911
00:55:40,057 --> 00:55:41,826
Thanks.

912
00:55:43,127 --> 00:55:44,693
Let's do this.

913
00:55:46,364 --> 00:55:47,996
Just so we're totally clear,

914
00:55:47,998 --> 00:55:49,898
one variant closes the loop
in this dimension,

915
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,134
and the other one sends you
back to your original dimension

916
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:53,303
and closes that loop.

917
00:55:53,305 --> 00:55:55,704
It's final decision time.

918
00:55:55,706 --> 00:55:57,641
Stay here or go back.

919
00:56:05,783 --> 00:56:07,850
I'm staying here.

920
00:56:07,852 --> 00:56:09,685
Final decision.

921
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:12,187
Okay. Here we go, then.

922
00:56:12,189 --> 00:56:14,658
Stand back.

923
00:56:28,072 --> 00:56:30,739
Huh? Wait.

924
00:56:30,741 --> 00:56:33,242
- What happened?
- Uh, uh...

925
00:56:33,244 --> 00:56:34,910
Oh, the vector's off.

926
00:56:34,912 --> 00:56:36,346
But you said
this was the right one.

927
00:56:36,348 --> 00:56:38,747
No, the math was right.
Something else is off.

928
00:56:38,749 --> 00:56:40,316
Guys, I have literally
been killing myself

929
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:42,017
to memorize this shit for you.

930
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:43,654
Failure's not an option.

931
00:56:45,323 --> 00:56:46,889
What?

932
00:56:46,891 --> 00:56:47,990
There's something
in hard drive.

933
00:56:47,992 --> 00:56:49,725
It must be a virus.

934
00:56:49,727 --> 00:56:53,130
Dude, did you open spam porn
again on the computer?

935
00:56:54,865 --> 00:56:56,732
No.

936
00:56:56,734 --> 00:56:59,302
Great. I have to manually
reenter all this code.

937
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:00,969
Okay, how long?

938
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:03,138
Six, seven hours.

939
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,940
Ryan, look at me.

940
00:57:04,942 --> 00:57:07,142
I am on borrowed time here.

941
00:57:07,144 --> 00:57:08,344
Understand?

942
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:09,811
Get it done.

943
00:57:09,813 --> 00:57:11,682
Uh, yeah, I'm on it.

944
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:17,755
Tree, wait up.

945
00:57:19,223 --> 00:57:21,156
Hey. Are you sure about this?

946
00:57:21,158 --> 00:57:22,392
Of course I'm sure.

947
00:57:22,394 --> 00:57:24,126
Okay, well,
what about the killer?

948
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:25,461
I mean, you said people
are gonna die tonight.

949
00:57:25,463 --> 00:57:27,095
If you close the loop
and we don't help,

950
00:57:27,097 --> 00:57:28,163
then they're dead for good,
aren't they?

951
00:57:28,165 --> 00:57:29,365
I have to stay alive.

952
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:30,832
I can't go back
to that hospital.

953
00:57:30,834 --> 00:57:32,335
It's way too risky.

954
00:57:32,337 --> 00:57:34,169
Okay, so that's it?
You're just gonna walk away

955
00:57:34,171 --> 00:57:35,837
and let a bunch
of innocent people die?

956
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:36,805
People die every day, Carter.

957
00:57:36,807 --> 00:57:39,808
I can't be responsible
for everyone, okay?

958
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:41,377
I know how selfish that sounds,
but it's true.

959
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:43,379
Yeah, no,
that sounds incredibly selfish.

960
00:57:43,381 --> 00:57:44,382
Are you serious?

961
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,383
That's not fair.

962
00:57:47,385 --> 00:57:49,419
You have no idea
how hard this is for me.

963
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:51,987
I don't want to have to choose
between you and my mom,

964
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:53,456
but I have to.

965
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:55,159
What do you mean, "choose"?

966
00:57:57,161 --> 00:58:00,265
Carter, we're together
in the other dimension.

967
00:58:04,502 --> 00:58:06,502
I woke up in your bed
every morning,

968
00:58:06,504 --> 00:58:07,970
just like this morning.

969
00:58:07,972 --> 00:58:11,940
I did it over and over
and over again

970
00:58:11,942 --> 00:58:13,543
until I fell in love with you.

971
00:58:13,545 --> 00:58:16,346
But that version of us
is back there,

972
00:58:16,348 --> 00:58:18,481
and my mom is alive here.

973
00:58:18,483 --> 00:58:20,416
So I've made my decision.

974
00:58:20,418 --> 00:58:23,486
Wh... What if you're wrong?

975
00:58:23,488 --> 00:58:25,288
Huh?

976
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,855
What if you're wrong?

977
00:58:26,857 --> 00:58:28,190
What if this isn't the life

978
00:58:28,192 --> 00:58:29,825
that you're-you're
supposed to have?

979
00:58:29,827 --> 00:58:31,494
So, what?
I'm just supposed to go back

980
00:58:31,496 --> 00:58:33,331
to some dimension
where my mom's dead?

981
00:58:35,232 --> 00:58:36,432
I can't.

982
00:58:36,434 --> 00:58:38,368
I can't lose her again.

983
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:39,968
You already did.

984
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:43,105
And none of this is real
if it erases that.

985
00:58:43,107 --> 00:58:45,441
You're just... you're living
someone else's life

986
00:58:45,443 --> 00:58:47,077
that doesn't belong to you.

987
00:58:48,346 --> 00:58:52,415
Y-Your pain,
th-that loss, that's...

988
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:54,286
that's what makes you you.

989
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:58,554
But you have the chance
to do something

990
00:58:58,556 --> 00:58:59,988
other people only dream of.

991
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:02,190
What?

992
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:04,094
You can say goodbye.

993
00:59:06,564 --> 00:59:08,266
Yoo-hoo.

994
00:59:11,436 --> 00:59:13,603
Your girlfriend's calling you.

995
00:59:13,605 --> 00:59:16,106
Better go.

996
00:59:17,509 --> 00:59:19,309
What's her problem?

997
00:59:19,311 --> 00:59:21,313
She just ditched
our house meeting.

998
00:59:23,013 --> 00:59:25,113
Hello.

999
00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:27,417
What were you guys
talking about?

1000
00:59:27,419 --> 00:59:30,185
Nothing. We were just... we
were going over school stuff.

1001
00:59:30,187 --> 00:59:31,953
Babe, don't forget,

1002
00:59:31,955 --> 00:59:33,591
I still need help
with my American lit paper.

1003
00:59:35,527 --> 00:59:37,560
I'm...
I'm really busy right now.

1004
00:59:37,562 --> 00:59:41,163
Carter, you promised.

1005
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:43,867
I won't pass the class
without your help.

1006
00:59:44,968 --> 00:59:46,234
All right. Yeah, yeah.

1007
00:59:46,236 --> 00:59:47,936
That's fine.

1008
00:59:47,938 --> 00:59:49,474
You're the best.

1009
00:59:57,014 --> 00:59:58,283
There's the other
birthday girl.

1010
00:59:59,983 --> 01:00:01,484
Sweetie, what's wrong?

1011
01:00:01,486 --> 01:00:03,553
I'm okay. I...

1012
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:05,954
You don't look okay.

1013
01:00:05,956 --> 01:00:07,457
I'm okay. I... Mom!

1014
01:00:07,459 --> 01:00:08,990
You're cold as ice.

1015
01:00:08,992 --> 01:00:10,660
Maybe we should go
to the hospital.

1016
01:00:10,662 --> 01:00:12,495
No!

1017
01:00:12,497 --> 01:00:15,030
No, we can't go there.

1018
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:17,333
Look, I don't want
to freak you guys out,

1019
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:19,335
but I need to get as far away
from campus as possible.

1020
01:00:19,337 --> 01:00:20,703
- Theresa, what is going on?
- Dad, please.

1021
01:00:20,705 --> 01:00:23,138
I promise to explain
everything later,

1022
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,040
but I need you to trust me.

1023
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,243
Okay.

1024
01:00:27,512 --> 01:00:29,012
We'll go.

1025
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,415
Let's go. Come on.

1026
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:34,218
Yeah.

1027
01:00:43,294 --> 01:00:45,961
Done.

1028
01:00:45,963 --> 01:00:47,530
Finally.

1029
01:00:47,532 --> 01:00:51,367
You guys ready?

1030
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:54,339
Okay. Let's close this loop
once and for all.

1031
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:22,063
Hey.

1032
01:01:22,065 --> 01:01:25,167
You know what
I'm craving right now?

1033
01:01:25,169 --> 01:01:27,770
- What?
- One of those giant cinnamon rolls

1034
01:01:27,772 --> 01:01:29,674
from that bakery in Morro Bay.

1035
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,311
From our birthday last year?

1036
01:01:35,313 --> 01:01:37,649
You don't remember?
You ate two of them.

1037
01:01:40,585 --> 01:01:42,318
That wasn't me.

1038
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,287
What, sweetie?

1039
01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:46,422
Hey, girls,
it's getting kind of late.

1040
01:01:46,424 --> 01:01:48,123
What do you say we find
someplace,

1041
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,392
turn in for the night?

1042
01:01:49,394 --> 01:01:51,394
Okay, sounds good.

1043
01:01:51,396 --> 01:01:53,331
I think we're all
pretty pooped.

1044
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,449
Lori!

1045
01:02:16,588 --> 01:02:18,523
Shit.

1046
01:02:32,504 --> 01:02:34,303
He got her, he got her!

1047
01:02:34,305 --> 01:02:36,104
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1048
01:02:36,106 --> 01:02:38,041
You might hit Kay.

1049
01:02:39,477 --> 01:02:41,711
Hey, girls,
I'm gonna go get some ice.

1050
01:02:41,713 --> 01:02:42,845
I'll be right back.

1051
01:02:42,847 --> 01:02:45,247
Okay.

1052
01:02:47,252 --> 01:02:49,719
Give me a hand.

1053
01:02:49,721 --> 01:02:51,422
Okay.

1054
01:02:53,725 --> 01:02:56,157
Just tell me one thing.

1055
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:57,560
Are you pregnant?

1056
01:02:57,562 --> 01:02:58,761
What?

1057
01:02:58,763 --> 01:03:00,429
No. Mom, I...

1058
01:03:00,431 --> 01:03:02,532
Okay, sorry.
I just had to ask.

1059
01:03:02,534 --> 01:03:03,733
It's not like that.

1060
01:03:03,735 --> 01:03:05,434
But it's a boy, isn't it?

1061
01:03:05,436 --> 01:03:07,202
No.

1062
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:09,206
Yes.

1063
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:12,175
I don't know.
It's complicated.

1064
01:03:13,278 --> 01:03:14,877
Trust me.

1065
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:17,613
I can do complicated.

1066
01:03:17,615 --> 01:03:19,751
What is it?

1067
01:03:24,722 --> 01:03:27,323
Have you ever wondered what
your life would have been like

1068
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:28,724
if you couldn't be with Dad?

1069
01:03:28,726 --> 01:03:30,893
What? No.

1070
01:03:30,895 --> 01:03:32,528
But what if you had to choose?

1071
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:35,230
You know, what if...
what if being with him meant

1072
01:03:35,232 --> 01:03:37,300
that you would lose someone
that you were really close to,

1073
01:03:37,302 --> 01:03:39,368
that you would never get
to see that person ever again?

1074
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:40,338
What would you do?

1075
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,540
Well, we all have to make
hard choices, Tree.

1076
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:47,208
That's life.

1077
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,745
And sometimes the past
is pulling us in one direction

1078
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:53,382
and the future is calling us
somewhere new.

1079
01:03:53,384 --> 01:03:56,352
But, of course, if I had
to choose, I'd pick Daddy.

1080
01:03:56,354 --> 01:03:58,489
I mean, without him,
I wouldn't have you, right?

1081
01:04:03,328 --> 01:04:05,763
But how did you know
that he was the one?

1082
01:04:06,864 --> 01:04:08,664
I didn't.

1083
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:10,266
I took a chance.

1084
01:04:10,268 --> 01:04:12,167
I followed my heart.

1085
01:04:12,169 --> 01:04:16,472
That's kind of
how love works, Tree.

1086
01:04:16,474 --> 01:04:17,775
It's a leap of faith.

1087
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,750
...Bayfield University
Hospital,

1088
01:04:27,752 --> 01:04:29,952
where a terrible tragedy
continues to unfold.

1089
01:04:29,954 --> 01:04:31,954
Details are still coming in,

1090
01:04:31,956 --> 01:04:34,690
but so far, we can confirm
three victims.

1091
01:04:34,692 --> 01:04:36,626
A nurse and a police officer.

1092
01:04:36,628 --> 01:04:38,427
The third victim, a student,

1093
01:04:38,429 --> 01:04:40,930
was killed while attempting
to subdue the suspect.

1094
01:04:40,932 --> 01:04:42,331
Back to you, Dan.

1095
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:44,199
No.

1096
01:04:44,201 --> 01:04:46,802
What's wrong?

1097
01:04:48,673 --> 01:04:51,507
Come on, Ryan. Come on.

1098
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:53,509
Hey, Samar, can you

1099
01:04:53,511 --> 01:04:55,478
- check 22-97-39 right there?
- Uh, yeah.

1100
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,279
Over there.

1101
01:04:57,281 --> 01:04:59,216
No, the vector
needs to be adjusted.

1102
01:05:00,785 --> 01:05:03,919
Yo, it's Ryan.
Leave a message at the beep...!

1103
01:05:03,921 --> 01:05:05,621
Ryan, don't close the loop.

1104
01:05:05,623 --> 01:05:06,889
- You can't...
- I'm sorry.

1105
01:05:06,891 --> 01:05:08,324
- This voice mailbox is...
- Shit!

1106
01:05:08,326 --> 01:05:09,659
Tree, what is going on?

1107
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:11,494
I can't let him close it.

1108
01:05:11,496 --> 01:05:13,396
You know,
I'm not sure about this ice.

1109
01:05:13,398 --> 01:05:14,664
It kind of smells like pee.

1110
01:05:14,666 --> 01:05:15,698
Tree?

1111
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,932
Tree! Where are you going?

1112
01:05:16,934 --> 01:05:18,901
Tree!

1113
01:05:24,976 --> 01:05:26,809
Come on.

1114
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:28,778
Come on, come on!
Pick up your phone!

1115
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,813
- Yo, it's Ryan. Leave a...
- Shit!

1116
01:05:30,815 --> 01:05:33,816
Here we go.

1117
01:05:33,818 --> 01:05:37,019
Where is it? Come on,
come on, come on. Please.

1118
01:06:26,671 --> 01:06:29,338
- Oh, hey. You're up.
- Shut up!

1119
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,973
I wasn't sure if you wanted
to sleep in or not.

1120
01:06:30,975 --> 01:06:32,708
That is the last time
I'm dying for you.

1121
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,445
What?

1122
01:06:40,952 --> 01:06:42,852
How much longer
is it gonna take?

1123
01:06:42,854 --> 01:06:45,721
Thanks to your crazy memory,
it shouldn't take long at all.

1124
01:06:45,723 --> 01:06:48,659
I can have Sissy ready to go
in just a few minutes.

1125
01:06:52,663 --> 01:06:54,497
I need a little more time.

1126
01:06:54,499 --> 01:06:56,400
There's something I need to do.

1127
01:06:58,336 --> 01:06:59,737
Tree.

1128
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:02,874
You sure you want to go back?

1129
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:08,677
Can't spend my life
living in the past.

1130
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:10,982
Got to take a leap of faith.

1131
01:07:18,489 --> 01:07:21,624
She finally rolls in.

1132
01:07:21,626 --> 01:07:23,959
Uh, Lori, hi.

1133
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:25,961
Big night?

1134
01:07:25,963 --> 01:07:27,532
You could say that.

1135
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:32,937
Um, look, Lori, I...

1136
01:07:35,439 --> 01:07:37,406
It's good to see you.

1137
01:07:37,408 --> 01:07:39,008
Wha...?

1138
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,709
It's good to see you, too,
Tree.

1139
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:51,387
He's not worth it.

1140
01:07:51,389 --> 01:07:54,056
I mean, trust me.

1141
01:07:54,058 --> 01:07:56,759
I've been involved
with a married guy.

1142
01:07:56,761 --> 01:08:00,129
I know what it's like
living a double life.

1143
01:08:00,131 --> 01:08:01,833
Always feeling like shit
about yourself.

1144
01:08:03,668 --> 01:08:04,969
But it's never too late
to change.

1145
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:11,907
Someone once told me that

1146
01:08:11,909 --> 01:08:15,945
"every day is a chance
to be someone better."

1147
01:08:15,947 --> 01:08:17,882
Maybe this is your day.

1148
01:08:20,852 --> 01:08:22,685
Okay.

1149
01:08:22,687 --> 01:08:24,355
Thank you.

1150
01:08:33,898 --> 01:08:35,833
Take care of yourself.

1151
01:08:54,886 --> 01:08:56,785
Tree.

1152
01:08:56,787 --> 01:08:58,654
Hey.

1153
01:08:58,656 --> 01:09:03,726
Um... look, Danielle,
I feel really bad.

1154
01:09:03,728 --> 01:09:05,094
I've totally been
misjudging you,

1155
01:09:05,096 --> 01:09:07,196
and it's completely on me.

1156
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:11,100
- I am so sorry that I've, like, made this...
- Nice.

1157
01:09:11,102 --> 01:09:12,868
Three-way.

1158
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,471
He's kidding.

1159
01:09:15,473 --> 01:09:16,572
No, I'm-I'm not.

1160
01:09:16,574 --> 01:09:19,575
Nick's, um, shower was broken,

1161
01:09:19,577 --> 01:09:21,477
so I said he could use mine.

1162
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:22,947
Right, Nick?

1163
01:09:24,048 --> 01:09:26,615
My shower's fine.

1164
01:09:26,617 --> 01:09:30,152
Right. Um, you know what?
Never mind.

1165
01:09:30,154 --> 01:09:32,488
Sorry for interrupting.

1166
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:34,189
Bye-ee.

1167
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:35,593
Bye-ee.

1168
01:09:37,061 --> 01:09:38,227
Ow!

1169
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:39,962
What was that for?

1170
01:09:39,964 --> 01:09:41,830
For being dumb as a rock.
That's what.

1171
01:09:41,832 --> 01:09:43,799
Oh, really?
How can a rock be dumb?

1172
01:09:43,801 --> 01:09:46,103
They don't even have brains.

1173
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:52,808
Ouch.

1174
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,887
There's the other
birthday girl.

1175
01:10:04,889 --> 01:10:06,557
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, Dad.

1176
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:11,627
Um, do you mind if I talk
to Mom alone for a minute?

1177
01:10:11,629 --> 01:10:12,962
Just some girl talk.

1178
01:10:12,964 --> 01:10:14,596
Oh. Well, sure.

1179
01:10:14,598 --> 01:10:16,732
I-I can go run some work calls.

1180
01:10:16,734 --> 01:10:18,903
Okay, thanks.

1181
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:23,205
Is everything okay?

1182
01:10:23,207 --> 01:10:24,773
Yeah. It's fine.

1183
01:10:24,775 --> 01:10:26,077
Everything's fine.

1184
01:10:29,814 --> 01:10:32,748
Oh, shit, how do I do this?

1185
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,752
Do what, sweetie?
What's wrong?

1186
01:10:35,853 --> 01:10:38,622
Mom...

1187
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:45,261
I really want you to know
how much I love you.

1188
01:10:45,263 --> 01:10:46,795
Aw.

1189
01:10:46,797 --> 01:10:48,230
I love you, too, sweetie.

1190
01:10:48,232 --> 01:10:50,601
No, Mom, I'm serious.

1191
01:10:55,006 --> 01:10:56,905
You know, people say
"I love you"

1192
01:10:56,907 --> 01:10:59,241
all the time, but...

1193
01:10:59,243 --> 01:11:02,244
it's not until you can't say it
to that person's face anymore

1194
01:11:02,246 --> 01:11:04,548
that you really realize
how much you mean it.

1195
01:11:10,121 --> 01:11:14,225
You are so beautiful
and so amazing.

1196
01:11:17,228 --> 01:11:19,194
And I just hope I can become

1197
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:21,297
half of the woman
that you are one day.

1198
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:24,969
Are you kidding?

1199
01:11:27,605 --> 01:11:30,074
I'm the woman I am
because I had you.

1200
01:11:31,675 --> 01:11:34,310
You know, I never really
told anyone this before,

1201
01:11:34,312 --> 01:11:37,913
but when I was pregnant with
you, I was scared shitless.

1202
01:11:37,915 --> 01:11:39,948
No.

1203
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:43,052
But then,
the moment I held you,

1204
01:11:43,054 --> 01:11:48,291
something inside of me
changed instantly.

1205
01:11:48,293 --> 01:11:49,825
The best kind of love
does that.

1206
01:11:49,827 --> 01:11:50,893
It changes you.

1207
01:11:50,895 --> 01:11:51,996
It makes you a better person.

1208
01:11:56,401 --> 01:11:59,103
Oh, God, I'm so stupid.

1209
01:12:00,938 --> 01:12:04,006
I really thought I could
have it all, but I can't.

1210
01:12:04,008 --> 01:12:06,208
Oh, honey, nobody can.

1211
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:07,776
But guess what.

1212
01:12:07,778 --> 01:12:08,977
That's okay.

1213
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:10,315
You'll get what you need.

1214
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:14,085
I hope so.

1215
01:12:15,186 --> 01:12:16,954
Aw. Come here.

1216
01:12:20,425 --> 01:12:22,059
Aw.

1217
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:27,363
Am I crushing you?

1218
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:29,898
Nope.

1219
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,367
You're always gonna be
my little girl.

1220
01:12:33,104 --> 01:12:36,939
♪ Happy birthday to you

1221
01:12:36,941 --> 01:12:42,378
♪ Happy birthday
to you ♪

1222
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:48,083

01:12:48,085 --> 01:12:52,189
♪ Happy birthday to you.

1224
01:12:57,295 --> 01:12:58,762
Make a wish.

1225
01:13:22,186 --> 01:13:23,355
You ready?

1226
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:28,790
Wait.

1227
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:32,295
Um, look.

1228
01:13:32,297 --> 01:13:35,431
I know this is probably
pretty confusing.

1229
01:13:35,433 --> 01:13:40,202
I mean, you guys have only
known me for a couple hours,

1230
01:13:40,204 --> 01:13:43,439
but I've known you for weeks.

1231
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:45,941
You've all worked
really, really hard

1232
01:13:45,943 --> 01:13:48,744
to try to send me home.

1233
01:13:48,746 --> 01:13:50,979
So thank you.

1234
01:13:50,981 --> 01:13:53,048
Well, jury's still out
on whether you're totally nuts,

1235
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:54,783
but, uh...

1236
01:13:54,785 --> 01:13:56,086
glad we could help.

1237
01:13:59,424 --> 01:14:01,359
Okay, Ryan, light her up.

1238
01:14:09,934 --> 01:14:12,901
S-So, in this other dimension,
do we...

1239
01:14:12,903 --> 01:14:14,705
do we know each other?

1240
01:14:15,973 --> 01:14:17,507
You could say that.

1241
01:14:17,509 --> 01:14:20,008
17 seconds.

1242
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:23,212
16, 15, 14...

1243
01:14:23,214 --> 01:14:27,115
What did I tell you
about turning that thing on?

1244
01:14:27,117 --> 01:14:29,319
- Uh-oh.
- Wait. This isn't supposed to happen yet.

1245
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:31,086
You're not supposed to come
until tomorrow.

1246
01:14:31,088 --> 01:14:32,854
Turn that thing off now.

1247
01:14:32,856 --> 01:14:33,924
No, don't!

1248
01:14:35,059 --> 01:14:36,959
- No, no, no, no!
- No, no!

1249
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:41,531
No, wait, please.
You can't do this.

1250
01:14:41,533 --> 01:14:44,800
- And who are you?
- I am a student here.

1251
01:14:44,802 --> 01:14:46,068
Oh, well, keep this
little attitude up,

1252
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:47,135
and we'll change that.

1253
01:14:47,137 --> 01:14:48,237
Get that thing out of here.

1254
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,172
- No, please d-don't.
- Hey, watch it, beefcake.

1255
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:52,007
- Don't. Don't.
- We spent 18 months on that thing.

1256
01:14:52,009 --> 01:14:53,476
Please, please don't. Please.

1257
01:14:53,478 --> 01:14:55,478
Well, don't manhandle her.

1258
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,947
Take...

1259
01:14:58,182 --> 01:15:00,383
Well, where are you taking her?

1260
01:15:00,385 --> 01:15:04,289
My office, where it will
remain under lock and key.

1261
01:15:13,864 --> 01:15:15,431
Look, okay, it's a setback.
I get it.

1262
01:15:15,433 --> 01:15:17,467
Right, but we just
reset the day and try again.

1263
01:15:17,469 --> 01:15:20,536
No. You don't understand.

1264
01:15:20,538 --> 01:15:23,105
I keep getting weaker
every time I come back.

1265
01:15:23,107 --> 01:15:25,575
I don't know
how many chances I have left.

1266
01:15:25,577 --> 01:15:27,310
For all I know,
this could be it.

1267
01:15:27,312 --> 01:15:29,479
If I die again,
I could stay dead.

1268
01:15:29,481 --> 01:15:31,316
- Hmm, that's a problem.
- No shit.

1269
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:33,984
Unless...

1270
01:15:38,055 --> 01:15:40,022
Unless we steal it back.

1271
01:15:40,024 --> 01:15:41,324
Steal it?

1272
01:15:41,326 --> 01:15:43,158
Well, I mean, you know,

1273
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,527
it's not even
technically stealing, is it?

1274
01:15:44,529 --> 01:15:46,028
It's your property.

1275
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,597
Whoa, whoa, guys,
I don't know about this.

1276
01:15:47,599 --> 01:15:49,532
Like, if we get caught
and I get expelled,

1277
01:15:49,534 --> 01:15:52,167
my parents are gonna hang me
by the nut sack.

1278
01:15:52,169 --> 01:15:53,503
I'm with him.

1279
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:55,371
Except for the "nut sack" part,
obviously.

1280
01:15:55,373 --> 01:15:57,540
Are you kidding me? Are...

1281
01:15:57,542 --> 01:15:59,542
No. I'm sorry to throw
a bag of dog shit

1282
01:15:59,544 --> 01:16:01,076
on your front porch here,
but I...

1283
01:16:01,078 --> 01:16:02,312
This is all on you guys.

1284
01:16:02,314 --> 01:16:04,046
You created this mess,

1285
01:16:04,048 --> 01:16:05,515
so you're obligated
to help her out of it.

1286
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:06,915
Besides,
if she dies again tonight,

1287
01:16:06,917 --> 01:16:08,251
that's blood on your hands.

1288
01:16:08,253 --> 01:16:10,420
That's a little dramatic.

1289
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:11,955
He's right.

1290
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,293
This is our fault.

1291
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:19,961
So we fix it.

1292
01:16:19,963 --> 01:16:23,100
That's what scientists do.

1293
01:16:24,234 --> 01:16:26,036
We solve the problem.

1294
01:16:28,506 --> 01:16:30,640
So, Dean Bronson's office
is in this building here,

1295
01:16:30,642 --> 01:16:34,142
and the fastest route back
to the lab is this path here.

1296
01:16:34,144 --> 01:16:35,578
And check this out, guys.
Dean Bronson spends

1297
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,313
every evening knitting in
the faculty lounge over here.

1298
01:16:37,315 --> 01:16:39,415
- Wait, what? He knits?
- I think he used to smoke,

1299
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:42,285
and then his wife
made him quit, and, uh...

1300
01:16:42,287 --> 01:16:45,254
Oh, by the way, shockingly hot.

1301
01:16:45,256 --> 01:16:46,955
- Samar?
- Hmm?

1302
01:16:46,957 --> 01:16:48,957
Could we do the-the thing
we're...

1303
01:16:48,959 --> 01:16:50,293
- we're doing right now?
- Okay, okay.

1304
01:16:50,295 --> 01:16:51,661
Right. Sorry.
Um, okay.

1305
01:16:51,663 --> 01:16:53,696
So, we need to get the keys
to his office,

1306
01:16:53,698 --> 01:16:55,698
sneak over to admissions,
break into the dean's office,

1307
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,700
grab Sissy,
wheel her back to the lab

1308
01:16:57,702 --> 01:16:59,302
without anyone from security
seeing us,

1309
01:16:59,304 --> 01:17:00,436
get Dean Bronson's keys
back to him

1310
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:01,704
without him ever knowing
they were gone,

1311
01:17:01,706 --> 01:17:02,605
power up Sissy,
run diagnostics,

1312
01:17:02,607 --> 01:17:05,475
flip the switch, and bam...
Tree's back

1313
01:17:05,477 --> 01:17:07,242
in whatever wack-ass dimension
she came from,

1314
01:17:07,244 --> 01:17:10,979
and we... well, we just
saved the damn day.

1315
01:17:10,981 --> 01:17:12,415
Okay.

1316
01:17:12,417 --> 01:17:14,983
Sounds awesome.

1317
01:17:14,985 --> 01:17:17,185
- How do we do that?
- I don't know.

1318
01:17:17,187 --> 01:17:19,322
- Of course.
- Okay, well,

1319
01:17:19,324 --> 01:17:21,089
we obviously need a diversion.

1320
01:17:21,091 --> 01:17:23,426
So we just got to find a way
to distract Dean Bronson.

1321
01:17:23,428 --> 01:17:25,430
♪ You're beautiful

1322
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:29,599
♪ You're beautiful

1323
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:31,233
♪ You're beautiful,
it's true... ♪

1324
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:33,269
Uh, she picked the ringtone,
all right? I...

1325
01:17:33,271 --> 01:17:34,604
Hey, babe.

1326
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:36,104
Yeah, uh, you okay?

1327
01:17:36,106 --> 01:17:37,707
I-I have an idea.
- Okay.

1328
01:17:37,709 --> 01:17:39,308
What if we actually
go through...

1329
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:40,443
With Ryan and them and...

1330
01:17:40,445 --> 01:17:42,244
- Danielle, hi.
- She's not...

1331
01:17:42,246 --> 01:17:46,249
So, we have
a little favor to ask.

1332
01:17:46,251 --> 01:17:47,983
I feel suspect at best.

1333
01:17:47,985 --> 01:17:49,385
Let's just put our face in.

1334
01:17:49,387 --> 01:17:51,086
Hey, baby.

1335
01:17:51,088 --> 01:17:53,256
Oh. Okay, sorry.

1336
01:17:53,258 --> 01:17:55,358
- Clearly, she's a little on edge.
- Mm-hmm.

1337
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,092
- That's right.
- Give her some room to breathe...

1338
01:17:57,094 --> 01:17:58,594
Preach.

1339
01:18:03,133 --> 01:18:04,500
Can I help you?

1340
01:18:04,502 --> 01:18:06,302
<i>Oh, perdón.</i>

1341
01:18:06,304 --> 01:18:08,939
I appear to be, uh, very lost.

1342
01:18:11,743 --> 01:18:15,645
Roger Bronson.
I'm the dean of the school.

1343
01:18:15,647 --> 01:18:17,078
<i>Oh, bonjour.</i>

1344
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:22,251
My name is, uh, Amelie Le Pew.

1345
01:18:22,253 --> 01:18:24,320
Oh. You must be with
the exchange program.

1346
01:18:24,322 --> 01:18:26,121
<i>Ah, oui, oui.</i>

1347
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:28,223
<i>Monsieur,</i> may I know your face?

1348
01:18:28,225 --> 01:18:30,158
I'm sorry?

1349
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,294
Oh.

1350
01:18:31,296 --> 01:18:34,062
- My. Oh, my.
- Oh, my!

1351
01:18:35,567 --> 01:18:37,667
What strong features.

1352
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:38,768
Thank you.

1353
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,101
You must be French.

1354
01:18:40,103 --> 01:18:41,504
Your hand smells like cheese.

1355
01:18:41,506 --> 01:18:43,240
I don't eat cheese.

1356
01:18:45,443 --> 01:18:47,710
Ah, I am, uh...

1357
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:53,349
...uh, lactose intolerant.

1358
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:55,083
<i>Oh, quelle dommage.</i>

1359
01:18:55,085 --> 01:18:58,153
Uh, uh... uh, where are you
trying to get to?

1360
01:18:58,155 --> 01:18:59,322
<i>Uh, le café.</i>

1361
01:18:59,324 --> 01:19:00,823
Oh, you must mean
the cafeteria.

1362
01:19:00,825 --> 01:19:03,526
- I'm happy to show you. Here, here. I can...
- Uh, whoa!

1363
01:19:03,528 --> 01:19:05,528
Oh, oh! Oh, don't move!
You'll trip.

1364
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,597
Oh, marbles.

1365
01:19:07,599 --> 01:19:10,533
Marbles! Marbles everywhere.

1366
01:19:10,535 --> 01:19:12,370
Go, go, go, go.

1367
01:19:14,772 --> 01:19:16,572
Oh, boy.

1368
01:19:16,574 --> 01:19:18,541
Oh.

1369
01:19:18,543 --> 01:19:20,409
- Careful.
- Whew!

1370
01:19:20,411 --> 01:19:21,844
Whoa.
Pretty quick there.

1371
01:19:21,846 --> 01:19:23,679
Hold on, now.
Just stay put, okay?

1372
01:19:23,681 --> 01:19:25,416
I just need to, uh,
grab my keys.

1373
01:19:27,485 --> 01:19:28,620
Whoa!

1374
01:19:30,555 --> 01:19:33,289
Oh! Not the tapestry.

1375
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:34,724
Oh, geez.

1376
01:19:34,726 --> 01:19:36,692
- Oh. Oh, Lord.
- Oh, oh, oh! Oh, no!

1377
01:19:36,694 --> 01:19:38,628
Oh, no. It's so dark.

1378
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:39,829
Move toward the light.

1379
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:41,196
Oh, sorry,
that was insensitive.

1380
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:42,567
Come on.

1381
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:49,639
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I'm trying.

1382
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:52,107
Stop rolling. Okay.

1383
01:19:52,109 --> 01:19:53,811
You're not helping.
The other way.

1384
01:20:00,418 --> 01:20:02,217
- Sissy.
- Go, go.

1385
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:03,319
Go around, go around.

1386
01:20:03,321 --> 01:20:04,522
This way.

1387
01:20:09,226 --> 01:20:10,762
Samar. Samar.

1388
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:15,431
Okay, okay.

1389
01:20:15,433 --> 01:20:16,832
Here we go. Up. Up.

1390
01:20:16,834 --> 01:20:18,568
Oh, God.

1391
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:20,636
Here's your cane.

1392
01:20:20,638 --> 01:20:23,138
You really must stop
wandering around.

1393
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:25,441
- Gracias. Okay.
- Okay. Shall we?

1394
01:20:25,443 --> 01:20:27,312
Ah, forgot my keys.

1395
01:20:30,882 --> 01:20:33,583
- Oh, God!
- Oh, no, <i>mon Dieu.</i>

1396
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:34,650
God!

1397
01:20:34,652 --> 01:20:36,619
Oh, that's a lot of blood.

1398
01:20:36,621 --> 01:20:38,721
Jesus, be careful
with that thing.

1399
01:20:38,723 --> 01:20:41,189
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

1400
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:45,394
Oh, I don't think the cane
is a good idea for you.

1401
01:20:45,396 --> 01:20:47,164
You need a Seeing Eye dog.

1402
01:20:52,303 --> 01:20:53,871
Checkmate.

1403
01:20:57,275 --> 01:20:59,207
Hey. How's it going?

1404
01:20:59,209 --> 01:21:01,211
We're on it.

1405
01:21:05,683 --> 01:21:07,516
Guys, we've got less
than three hours

1406
01:21:07,518 --> 01:21:08,784
to make this happen.

1407
01:21:08,786 --> 01:21:10,655
Not gonna lie...
it's gonna be close.

1408
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:13,889
Shit.

1409
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:16,561
If I don't stop the killer,
Lori's gonna die.

1410
01:21:17,695 --> 01:21:18,894
Stay here.

1411
01:21:18,896 --> 01:21:20,763
What? Why?

1412
01:21:20,765 --> 01:21:22,500
Just promise me
you'll stay here.

1413
01:21:23,568 --> 01:21:24,867
Can I borrow this?

1414
01:21:24,869 --> 01:21:26,402
Uh, y-yeah, sure.

1415
01:21:26,404 --> 01:21:27,503
Okay.

1416
01:21:27,505 --> 01:21:29,505
W-Wait, where are you going?

1417
01:21:29,507 --> 01:21:30,840
Tree!

1418
01:21:53,798 --> 01:21:56,298
Sorry, bad timing.

1419
01:22:05,476 --> 01:22:08,878
Okay. Okay.

1420
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,480
Okay, you can put it away.

1421
01:22:11,482 --> 01:22:13,618
Come on, put it away.

1422
01:22:16,521 --> 01:22:19,857
Okay, now slowly turn around.

1423
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:28,564
This is a really bad idea.

1424
01:22:28,566 --> 01:22:30,299
There's a killer
on the loose here.

1425
01:22:30,301 --> 01:22:31,434
Go get help.

1426
01:22:31,436 --> 01:22:32,737
- What?
- Go!

1427
01:22:35,406 --> 01:22:37,740
She's got a gun!
She's got a gun!

1428
01:22:46,017 --> 01:22:47,717
Lori, move.

1429
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,487
- What?
- Come on, we've got to move.

1430
01:22:51,489 --> 01:22:53,456
- What's happening?
- I'll explain later. Move!

1431
01:23:03,701 --> 01:23:05,403
What is this?

1432
01:23:07,839 --> 01:23:09,907
You're not blind.

1433
01:23:12,376 --> 01:23:13,943
I'm gonna kill them.

1434
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:16,781
I'm going to kill them!

1435
01:23:19,484 --> 01:23:20,883
He's onto us.

1436
01:23:20,885 --> 01:23:23,085
Babe, can you also get
my sunglasses back?

1437
01:23:23,087 --> 01:23:24,455
I just got those.

1438
01:23:28,526 --> 01:23:30,659
Okay, okay, come on. Yes.

1439
01:23:30,661 --> 01:23:32,328
Get it open now.

1440
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:33,297
Get it, get it.

1441
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,433
Bash it in.

1442
01:23:37,435 --> 01:23:39,401
- Keep 'em out.
- We're trying!

1443
01:23:39,403 --> 01:23:41,437
Get it open now!

1444
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:44,406
Oh, my God. If I get expelled,
my parents are gonna disown me.

1445
01:23:44,408 --> 01:23:45,708
Tree, will you please tell me
what's going on?

1446
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:47,743
At first, I thought
he was trying to kill me,

1447
01:23:47,745 --> 01:23:49,413
- but it's you he's after.
- Who?

1448
01:23:50,581 --> 01:23:52,650
It's over, Gregory.

1449
01:23:58,856 --> 01:24:01,423
What? Why?

1450
01:24:01,425 --> 01:24:03,661
His wife found out
about your affair.

1451
01:24:06,697 --> 01:24:10,701
<i>So he stole a page
from your old playbook.</i>

1452
01:24:13,738 --> 01:24:15,704
<i>He set Tombs free,
knowing that everyone</i>

1453
01:24:15,706 --> 01:24:18,374
<i>would think that he killed you.</i>

1454
01:24:18,376 --> 01:24:21,312
<i>And the secret of your affair
would die with you.</i>

1455
01:24:24,482 --> 01:24:25,748
Bravo.

1456
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,983
Well done, indeed.

1457
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:30,152
Once a douchebag,
always a douchebag.

1458
01:24:30,154 --> 01:24:31,854
I'm sorry, do I know you?

1459
01:24:31,856 --> 01:24:32,990
Stay back, asshole.

1460
01:24:37,695 --> 01:24:39,829
Put your back into it!

1461
01:24:39,831 --> 01:24:41,063
Try harder.

1462
01:24:41,065 --> 01:24:43,799
You guys got to get back
into the gym, man.

1463
01:24:44,936 --> 01:24:47,036
Ryan, we can't hold it
much longer.

1464
01:24:47,038 --> 01:24:48,904
Come on, come on.

1465
01:24:50,474 --> 01:24:51,707
You hear that?

1466
01:24:51,709 --> 01:24:53,344
You're gonna rot in prison.

1467
01:24:54,445 --> 01:24:56,178
I don't think so.

1468
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:58,013
You see,
there's one little detail

1469
01:24:58,015 --> 01:24:59,915
you failed to realize
in all this.

1470
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:01,917
Oh, really? What's that?

1471
01:25:01,919 --> 01:25:03,452
Me.

1472
01:25:04,755 --> 01:25:06,657
Lori!

1473
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:09,458
You really think
I was gonna let

1474
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:11,126
a little whore like that
ruin my life?

1475
01:25:21,205 --> 01:25:24,039
Gregory, kill her.

1476
01:25:38,956 --> 01:25:41,525
Would you like
to do the honors?

1477
01:25:42,827 --> 01:25:44,595
Don't mind if I do.

1478
01:25:48,032 --> 01:25:50,701
Oh, wait.
I almost forgot.

1479
01:25:53,004 --> 01:25:54,972
I want a divorce.

1480
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,674
Now, where were we?

1481
01:25:58,676 --> 01:25:59,977
Hey!

1482
01:26:44,822 --> 01:26:49,961
Aw, look who brought
a screwdriver to a gunfight.

1483
01:26:54,031 --> 01:26:55,132
Wait.

1484
01:26:56,634 --> 01:26:58,200
I have something
I need to tell you.

1485
01:26:58,202 --> 01:26:59,236
What?

1486
01:27:00,538 --> 01:27:02,540
You're screwed.

1487
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:08,744
Turn it off, you bitch.

1488
01:27:14,085 --> 01:27:17,653
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, wait. Wait!

1489
01:27:36,674 --> 01:27:38,308
Ready? Come on.

1490
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,975
There you go. I got you.

1491
01:27:39,977 --> 01:27:42,345
I got you.

1492
01:27:42,347 --> 01:27:44,347
All right. Yep.

1493
01:27:44,349 --> 01:27:46,316
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1494
01:27:46,318 --> 01:27:48,917
I guess this is a pretty good
place to get shot, huh?

1495
01:27:48,919 --> 01:27:50,286
I'll lift you up now,
all right?

1496
01:27:50,288 --> 01:27:51,820
- You're gonna be okay.
- You're good.

1497
01:27:51,822 --> 01:27:53,789
It's okay, it's okay.

1498
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:55,691
You're okay.

1499
01:27:55,693 --> 01:27:57,092
Lori, I...

1500
01:27:57,094 --> 01:27:59,595
I'm so sorry.

1501
01:27:59,597 --> 01:28:01,331
For what?

1502
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:03,299
You just saved my life.

1503
01:28:03,301 --> 01:28:06,135
I just...

1504
01:28:06,137 --> 01:28:08,003
I wish things
could have been different.

1505
01:28:08,005 --> 01:28:10,275
I'm sorry,
but we need to move her.

1506
01:28:13,144 --> 01:28:14,945
Hang in there, hon.

1507
01:28:20,818 --> 01:28:22,151
Hey.

1508
01:28:22,153 --> 01:28:23,719
- Hey.
- You okay?

1509
01:28:23,721 --> 01:28:25,220
Uh, yeah.

1510
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:27,290
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

1511
01:28:27,292 --> 01:28:29,259
I thought I told you
to stay put.

1512
01:28:29,261 --> 01:28:31,394
Yeah, well...

1513
01:28:31,396 --> 01:28:33,062
sorry, couldn't help myself.

1514
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:42,237
I think it's time.

1515
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:45,176
I hope you realize I'm only
going back for one reason.

1516
01:30:10,495 --> 01:30:12,863
Oh, man.

1517
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:17,402
My Yoo-hoo.

1518
01:30:35,487 --> 01:30:38,020
Danielle?

1519
01:30:38,022 --> 01:30:39,857
Who?

1520
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:47,796
Hi.

1521
01:30:47,798 --> 01:30:50,300

Yes, it does.

1572
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:10,038
It acted like a slingshot.

1573
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:11,507
When she jumped back
into this dimension,

1574
01:33:11,509 --> 01:33:13,108
the vacuum created
by the centripetal force

1575
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:15,010
closed the loop.

1576
01:33:15,012 --> 01:33:18,481
Who throws away
a perfectly good churro?

1577
01:33:18,483 --> 01:33:21,218
Oh, no, don't.

1578
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:31,028
Uh-oh. This looks bad.

1579
01:33:32,497 --> 01:33:34,930
Ryan Phan?

1580
01:33:34,932 --> 01:33:36,332
Uh, maybe.

1581
01:33:36,334 --> 01:33:38,668
I'm Dr. Isaac Parker.
I'm here on behalf of DARPA.

1582
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:40,670
We'd appreciate it
if you'd come with us

1583
01:33:40,672 --> 01:33:42,572
to answer some questions.

1584
01:33:42,574 --> 01:33:43,706
All of you.

1585
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:44,908
Are we in trouble?

1586
01:33:46,511 --> 01:33:48,946
Please, right this way.

1587
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:02,325
Dr. Kalibato to Robotics.

1588
01:34:02,327 --> 01:34:05,597
Dr. Kalibato to Robotics.

1589
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,273
Holy shit.

1590
01:34:17,275 --> 01:34:18,608
Sissy.

1591
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:20,543
Hope you don't mind us
borrowing her.

1592
01:34:20,545 --> 01:34:23,279
What you've created here
is truly remarkable.

1593
01:34:23,281 --> 01:34:25,415
Suck it, Dean Bronson.

1594
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:27,717
We've been having
some difficulties

1595
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:30,152
understanding
how the device operates.

1596
01:34:30,154 --> 01:34:32,187
We figured you could help.

1597
01:34:32,189 --> 01:34:33,322
There's so many different
algorithms.

1598
01:34:33,324 --> 01:34:35,157
It'll be tough to find
the right one to make it work.

1599
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:37,194
I might be able
to help with that.

1600
01:34:38,363 --> 01:34:39,562
Great.

1601
01:34:39,564 --> 01:34:41,497
So, we just need to find
a test subject.

1602
01:34:41,499 --> 01:34:44,500
Wait, you... you want to trap
somebody in a time loop?

1603
01:34:44,502 --> 01:34:46,069
That's messed up.

1604
01:34:47,405 --> 01:34:49,072
Unless they deserve it.

1605
01:34:54,312 --> 01:34:57,747
I think I have
the perfect recruit.
