A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,720
MORNING OF DECEMBER 11TH

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,080
MAURICE LEBLANC'S BIRTHDAY

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,880
Sir, your ticket. Thank you.

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
Sir, your ticket.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,240
Ladies and gentlemen, tickets.

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,760
Raoul!

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
Raoul!

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,800
Stop!

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,800
Let go of me!

11
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,000
Stop!

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,320
Raoul!

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Raoul!

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
Raoul!

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,880
Lupin?

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,000
Looking for a child dressed up as Lupin?

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,560
Yes! A little boy!

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,520
He's 14. He's our son.

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,160
He's wearing a top hat.

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,120
Mixed-race.

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,520
-Mixed-race?
-Yes.

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,160
I saw a mixed-race boy
tussling with a guy.

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,360
Wait!

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,280
Raoul!

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,360
Raoul!

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,080
They went that way. In a gray BMW.

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,880
-What was he like?
-Black. Beige raincoat.

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,480
Badly shaved, skinny.

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,520
Shit, Assane.

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,080
This is your fault!

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,920
It's the guy from the train!
Who the fuck is he?

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,760
You lied to me!

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,360
Stop! What are you doing?

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,800
What are you doing?

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Let go of that car! I'm calling the cops.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,120
No, not the cops. Stop it.

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Calm down. Let me handle it. OK?

38
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,720
-I'll call them.
-Trust me! Not the cops.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,280
-I'll bring him back. Trust me.
-I stopped trusting you a while ago.

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,120
Claire, not the police.

41
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,960
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,960
I want to help.

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,520
MUSIC CONSERVATORY

44
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,880
Claire? How was your rehearsal?

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
Don't want me to walk with you?

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
What did I do?

47
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,880
What's going on?

48
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,720
Claire?

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
Not everything revolves around you.

50
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,240
I left the room.
It was like this when I came back.

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,040
I bet no one fessed up to it.

52
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,080
-People will do anything.
-Can you fix it?

53
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,920
Fixing it would cost more
than buying a new one.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Hang on.

55
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,360
What about my audition?

56
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,520
Hang on…

57
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,680
Here.

58
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,280
Try this one.

59
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
It sounds great.

60
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,560
-How much?
-3,000 francs.

61
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
I don't have enough.

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
Can we rent it?

64
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,320
-And you are?
-Assane.

65
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
He's a friend.

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,280
You can rent it for 350 francs a day.

67
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,320
Yeah. But not you.

68
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,720
-Why?
-Yes, why?

69
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,160
Because. It's my shop. I decide.

70
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
Good luck for your exam.

71
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,640
Come on, Assane.

72
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Let's go.

73
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
Racist.

74
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,840
-Do you know the area?
-No.

75
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,960
Get your phone, see where we are,

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,360
and where they could be.

77
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,560
Wait a minute.

78
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,360
Fuck, no reception!

79
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,000
Must be a map in this car.

80
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
They passed through Bourneville!

81
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,800
-Is it far?
-I'd say four, five kilometers.

82
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,200
Maybe they stopped there,
or someone saw them.

83
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,520
We have to stop there.
I need to make a call.

84
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,800
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

85
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,080
My wife's in Étretat.
How am I supposed to tell her?

86
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
You know women.

87
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,200
She'll be thinking
I'm the one who was kidnapped.

88
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,840
Come on!

89
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,840
CALL FAILED

90
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Shit!

91
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
Look somewhere else.

92
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,520
Or I'll make you.

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
Come with me!

94
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I said get in there. Get in there!

95
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,920
-What do you suggest?
-A missing person report at the station.

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,760
After 24 hours,

97
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,320
we send a broadcast to all services.

98
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,160
A broadcast to all services?

99
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,160
Do you realize that this is a kidnapping?

100
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,320
OK, you're useless.

101
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,960
-Where are you going?
-To find my son.

102
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,440
You scream, I'll kill you.

103
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
Good, you learn fast.

104
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,240
Gentlemen.

105
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Do you have a phone?

106
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,480
And some change?

107
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
Well, you have to buy something.

108
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,240
-Who is this?
-It's Léonard.

109
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,480
I'm in Bourneville, a village in Normandy.

110
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,880
-Why there?
-I followed our client, as planned,

111
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,600
but I wanted to tell you that…

112
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,040
there was a small setback.

113
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,640
-I'm with his son.
-His son?

114
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,360
-Yes.
-Listen. It's the father I want.

115
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,720
Clean up your mess, and do it neatly.

116
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,640
Shit.

117
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,480
Gentlemen.

118
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,200
Don't be stupid.

119
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,320
Sir?

120
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,080
Have you seen a gray car?
A Black man at the wheel? A teenager?

121
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,720
A gray car? Sir?

122
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,480
Answer me, at least.

123
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,040
Even "no" is an answer.

124
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,680
-Hello?
-Hello, it's me.

125
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,800
-Still sick?
-No.

126
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,120
-I'm in Normandy.
-What?

127
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,040
You need to get back here.
Shit's getting real.

128
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,520
-Why?
-We caught the wrong Sernine.

129
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,680
-Of course. I'm with him now.
-What?

130
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,080
-He's right in front of me.
-Sernine?

131
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,440
Yes, Sernine!

132
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,040
-I'm in Bourneville.
-Why are you with him?

133
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,240
He's coming over.

134
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
Is everything OK?

135
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,480
-You can't talk?
-Yes, right.

136
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,400
-Do you need backup?
-Yes.

137
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
We need to catch him.

138
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,840
I love you too.

139
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,800
Excuse me.

140
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,520
I'm looking for a Black man in a gray car.

141
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,360
With a 14-year-old teenager.
Mixed-race, curly hair.

142
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He's my son. He's been kidnapped.

143
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,480
So, if you know anything,

144
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,840
tell me.

145
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,440
Buy something.

146
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
-I'm not kidding around.
-It's him!

147
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,680
-I'll continue on my own.
-I have to join you!

148
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,560
I can help you catch this guy.

149
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,000
Get in.

150
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,920
Her exam's on Friday.
A church in the 11th district.

151
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,760
-Why did they break her violin?
-She's too good.

152
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,640
For real. I heard her play.
She's incredible.

153
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,400
So, if you find her a violin,
you'll be her hero.

154
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,320
For now,
I'm more like her problem than her hero.

155
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,760
The asshole from the shop won't rent it
since she's friends with a Black boy.

156
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,680
Seriously?

157
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,920
-What would Lupin have done?
-You know him best.

158
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,960
I think he would go back to the store,

159
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,000
steal a violin,

160
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
and give it to Claire.

161
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,720
There!

162
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,040
I'M ON MY WAY!

163
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,440
-It's my wife.
-Yeah?

164
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,400
No!

165
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
We've lost him.

166
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,240
I'm opening up. Don't be stupid.

167
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
It's your son?

168
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,280
DAD, I TOOK THE GUY'S PHONE.

169
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,080
I GOT AWAY.

170
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,400
WHERE ARE YOU?

171
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,720
IN SOME OLD HOUSE

172
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,760
LET'S DO LIKE LUPIN DOES WITH HIS DAUGHTER
IN CAGLIOSTRO

173
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,840
It's not Lupin's daughter.

174
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
-It's his son.
-You a fan of Lupin?

175
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,960
-Yes, I love it.
-So does my son.

176
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,120
If he wrote this, he'll spot the mistake.

177
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,480
If he doesn't…

178
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
It's a trap.

179
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,280
Don't be scared. Your dad's on his way.

180
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,480
I'll take care of him.

181
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,440
And then,

182
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,280
I'll take care of you.

183
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,000
This way.

184
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,080
Hey!

185
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,720
Hey!

186
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,320
What are you doing? Hide!

187
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,520
Hey! He can see you!

188
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,760
Well, it's your father.

189
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,000
-Dad!
-Shut up!

190
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,200
Dad! I'm here!

191
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,160
Touch one hair on his head,

192
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,600
I'll kill you.

193
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,720
-I'm here!
-You want your son?

194
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Come and get him.

195
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,920
CLOSED

196
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,560
-There's a way in through the back.
-Possibly.

197
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,000
We get the violin.
We'll give it back to him.

198
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,880
-Once she's passed her exam?
-Yes.

199
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,040
You coming?

200
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,240
Who will keep lookout?

201
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,720
You're right.

202
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,160
What's that noise?

203
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,200
-Call the police. It's their job.
-No.

204
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Police are either incompetent or corrupt.
Or both.

205
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,840
-Don't say that.
-I'm telling you.

206
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,320
My son's kidnapper
has the police in his pocket.

207
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,240
What?

208
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,640
All right.

209
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,320
What would Lupin do?

210
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,520
This isn't a game.

211
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,680
ESTIMATED TIME TO ARRIVAL:
1 HOUR 25 MINUTES

212
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
-Bye.
-Bye.

213
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,120
-Why are you here?
-Waiting for you.

214
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,880
Something for you.

215
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,560
Here.

216
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,720
Open it.

217
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,280
Assane, what did you do?

218
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,200
Relax, I just borrowed it.

219
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,040
Go on, try it out.

220
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,000
-No, I can't.
-Go on.

221
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,960
No!

222
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,560
Play for me!

223
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,880
Come to the audition.

224
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,120
-Please.
-No.

225
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,280
How much time do I have?

226
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,440
For what?

227
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,720
Before they get here.

228
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
-Who?
-Your colleagues at the station.

229
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,240
The ones you called.

230
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,840
Your wife.

231
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
When do they arrive?

232
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,520
-I don't know.
-You're lying, Guédira.

233
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,240
I know your name. You're a cop.

234
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,840
Been searching for you for weeks.

235
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,640
-Only I figured it out.
-I know.

236
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,200
-I'd have arrested you if…
-If you were armed.

237
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,040
You're Ganimard.

238
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
How much time?

239
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,520
One hour, maybe a bit less.

240
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,720
Thank you.

241
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,040
Hey!

242
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,960
Untie me!

243
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,960
I can help you!

244
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,160
I already told you.

245
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,640
I don't work with cops.

246
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,320
ESTIMATED TIME TO ARRIVAL:
45 MINUTES

247
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,000
Raoul?

248
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,520
Raoul?

249
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,840
Raoul?

250
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,440
Like father, like son…

251
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,320
Raoul!

252
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,320
Raoul?

253
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,560
Raoul, can you hear me?

254
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,680
Where are you? Answer me!

255
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,440
-Raoul!
-Dad!

256
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,720
-Dad!
-Can you hear me?

257
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,840
Dad, I'm here!

258
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,360
Raoul!

259
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,280
-Raoul, answer me!
-Dad!

260
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,480
-Raoul!
-Here!

261
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Here! Help!

262
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Dad, is that you?

263
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,760
Help!

264
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,200
-Help, I'm here!
-Signal me, Raoul!

265
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,440
Can you hear me?

266
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,440
Raoul!

267
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,440
Help!

268
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,680
Help! Help me!

269
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,080
Get me out of here!

270
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,920
Dad!

271
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,080
Raoul!

272
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,160
NEXT TIME TRY THE CAR

273
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,320
Raoul!

274
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,600
Raoul!

275
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,760
Raoul!

276
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,280
Raoul.

277
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,520
Don't move.

278
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,480
My son.

279
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,320
-He's inside.
-Hands behind your head.

280
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,360
-I said, hands behind your head!
-My son…

281
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,000
Your hands!

282
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
Give me your arm.

283
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,920
Raoul.

284
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,920
Get up.

285
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,280
I said, get up!

286
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
Get the fuck up!

287
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,000
Come with me.

288
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,960
-I really believed it.
-What?

289
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,080
That we were as good as Lupin.

290
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,240
My son… He's in there.

291
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,440
That won't work.
Not falling for your tricks.

292
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,760
Don't move.

293
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,000
Raoul.

294
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,840
I'm sorry!

295
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,160
Raoul.
