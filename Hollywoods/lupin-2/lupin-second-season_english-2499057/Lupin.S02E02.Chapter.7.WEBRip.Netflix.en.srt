00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,320
All right!

3
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,960
No sign of Guédira.

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
But we have Sernine.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
Thank you, Captain. OK.

6
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
Back to Paris.

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,760
-We have to watch him closely.
-Of course.

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,840
Have you found my son?

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,680
Have you found my son?

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,640
A theft, a break-in, a kidnapping…

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,440
We have a lot to talk about!

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,960
-Have you found him?
-Where's my colleague?

13
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,320
Thomas, my dear Thomas, a few weeks ago,

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,400
we fell victim to a terrible injustice.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,840
The foundation was robbed.

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,840
But we refuse to be intimidated.

17
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,880
That's why, this evening,
we're organizing a dinner

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,640
which generous donors will attend.

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,200
Citizens who believe in
the future of our country.

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,880
A worthy initiative!

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,400
Every young person, no matter
their background, deserves to be inspired.

22
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,760
That'll be the role,
the mission of our foundation:

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,000
access to the nation's
highest cultural institutions.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,880
And we will succeed.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,840
We'll end on that note.

26
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,720
Thank you both.

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,120
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

28
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
Your appointment's here.

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I don't have one.

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,240
Would you excuse me?

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,640
What did you find inside the car?

32
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,520
Don't answer. He's messing with us.
It won't work.

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm not!

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
Was there a body or not?

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,560
-Answer me!
-Want to know what was inside?

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,720
There was nothing!

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,520
Inside the trunk…

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,920
This is what was inside! A can!

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,920
Now please stop pissing us off.

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,120
We need to stop.

41
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,360
-Don't even think about it.
-What?

42
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,120
I will shoot.

43
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,800
Don't worry.

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,400
I won't escape before Paris.

45
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Thanks for the info.

46
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
-I need the bathroom.
-Hold it in.

47
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,400
-I can't.
-No bathrooms here.

48
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,160
There are. Over there.

49
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,080
-Take him to the bathroom?
-Hold this.

50
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
Let's go.

51
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,120
Stop.

52
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,480
-You're not coming in?
-No.

53
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Don't lock the door.

54
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,880
Hector?

55
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,240
Relax.

56
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm not a serial killer.
I just stole some jewels. OK?

57
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,680
-Hector?
-Yes?

58
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,600
-You need to come in here.
-Why?

59
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,120
I can't do anything
with these handcuffs.

60
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,920
-Do you want a receipt?
-Yes.

61
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,720
Thank you.

62
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,920
Thank you, miss. Bye.

63
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,240
Sir! Police.

64
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,920
-You have a flat tire.
-Really?

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,360
-Which one?
-Back right.

66
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,680
Look.

67
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,840
-It was the other car.
-Belkacem!

68
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,320
-Belkacem!
-No, Hector!

69
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
No!

70
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,120
Shit!

71
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,240
Shit! Fucking hell!

72
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't work with cops.

73
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
Fuck.

74
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,280
No.

75
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm here! Help!

76
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,440
Raoul!

77
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,320
Over here! Help!

78
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,320
Raoul, I'm here. Don't worry.

79
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,760
-I'm here!
-Help!

80
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,080
Help me!

81
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,200
Open up!

82
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
Raoul! OK? I'm here, don't worry.

83
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,840
-Where's my father?
-I don't know.

84
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,120
Come on!

85
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,440
Hurry up! Quickly!

86
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,800
Hurry up!

87
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Come on! Quickly, get in.

88
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,600
-How does this work?
-Who are you?

89
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,680
A friend of your dad's. A cop.
I'll get you out of here.

90
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,680
All good!

91
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,840
Where's my father?

92
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,560
Your father and I share the same passion.

93
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,480
Arsène Lupin.

94
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,760
He's a fan.

95
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,640
I know he is. So am I.

96
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,640
Your fave character?

97
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,680
-Ganimard.
-Ganimard?

98
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,120
Yes. He's a cop like me, of course.

99
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
-What about you?
-Arsène Lupin.

100
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,320
-Arsène Lupin in Arsène Lupin. Good job.
-Yeah.

101
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,840
You can't choose the best character
for no reason.

102
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,680
He reminds me of my dad.

103
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,640
My dad…

104
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,600
He's my favorite person.

105
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
You got me there.

106
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,040
Diop was in an abandoned farm.

107
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,760
-We sent our guys in to arrest him…
-And?

108
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,360
He escaped.

109
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,200
Well, you have his son.

110
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,800
-Oh?
-Isn't the North African one of yours?

111
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,320
Guédira? He's not on the case.

112
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,320
But he has the Diop kid.

113
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,880
-His son?
-Yes. That's very good news.

114
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,160
He figures out we have his son?
We won't have to look for him.

115
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,760
We'll use the kid as bait.

116
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,680
He'll come to us.

117
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,520
Guédira will bring us the kid.
Bring you the kid.

118
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
We'll let Diop know he's with us.

119
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,440
We wait for him. You arrest him.

120
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
You and my men.

121
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,760
You're putting me in a delicate position.

122
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,080
-We're acting outside of any procedure.
-Who gives a damn, Dumont?

123
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,360
He's the most wanted man in France.
Your superiors will be grateful.

124
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,800
So?

125
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
Are you in or out?

126
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,440
What if he calls the police?

127
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,000
He's a player, Dumont.

128
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,800
A boxing match needs two contestants.

129
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,040
So?

130
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
It's risky.

131
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,680
But worth a shot.

132
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,400
GREAT JOB WITH THE DIOP KID

133
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,840
CALL ME

134
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,200
What would Lupin do?

135
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,400
-You a fan of Lupin?
-Yes, I love it.

136
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,600
I CAN'T TALK, I'M DRIVING

137
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,200
BRING THE KID TO THE PARK HYATT HOTEL

138
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,800
I'LL EXPLAIN

139
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
I'M ON MY WAY

140
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,480
Hello.

141
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,120
Dad, I've added a few introductory lines
to my speech. Can I read them to you?

142
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,120
Today, the source of creativity

143
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,160
doesn't only belong
to traditional social classes.

144
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,040
The blending of cultures
towards which the foundation works

145
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,760
must be the breeding ground
for innovative creativity.

146
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,240
It's great.

147
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,360
-Is this it?
-On the corner.

148
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,080
-Who are these guys?
-I don't know.

149
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,680
-Are you Raoul?
-Yes.

150
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,840
You're Guédira?

151
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,280
-You work with Commissioner Dumont?
-Yes.

152
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,680
Pascal Oblet. Cop.

153
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,560
Why aren't you at the Hyatt Hotel?
Dumont is there.

154
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,800
-Why the Hyatt Hotel?
-It's dangerous here.

155
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,520
Why? What's going on?

156
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,880
-Did they catch our guy?
-Just obey.

157
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,520
Take the kid to the hotel.
We'll chat later.

158
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,400
It will be fine.

159
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,840
I'll let them know you're coming. Go on.

160
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,520
-Quit worrying.
-I'm not. I'm just asking.

161
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,320
-They'll love you.
-Thank you.

162
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't forget to mention the tax benefit.

163
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,600
-That's what people like.
-You've told me a million times.

164
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,160
-You're annoying!
-Where are you going?

165
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,600
-My room is on the eighth floor.
-Really?

166
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,920
-That's new.
-You need to ascend in life.

167
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,400
The kid's on his way.

168
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,480
We'll order a pizza,
stick him in front of the TV.

169
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,960
We'll call his dad,
tell him to come pick him up.

170
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,520
Perfect. My men are in position.
Let's let Diop do the rest.

171
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,840
Dumont.

172
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,360
Tie.

173
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,360
Yes, sir.

174
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,160
A few weeks ago,
we fell victim to a terrible injustice.

175
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,640
The foundation was robbed.

176
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,400
We refuse to be intimidated.

177
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,040
We're organizing a dinner

178
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,480
which generous donors will attend.

179
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,360
Citizens who, like myself,
believe in the future of our country.

180
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Nothing will stop us
from launching this initiative.

181
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,480
Have a seat.
Mr. Bouchard will be here shortly.

182
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,400
Hello, this is Lorenzo Callegari,
the owner of the violin store.

183
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,760
I got your letter and,
to answer your question,

184
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,160
I should think it fair

185
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,840
if this young man were to be punished
as severely as possible.

186
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,360
Keep me posted. Thanks. Have a nice day.

187
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,360
So, Assane Diop.

188
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,560
What now?

189
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
I don't get you.

190
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,480
You're attending a good school,
free of charge.

191
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,600
You have it all.

192
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,560
You have to ruin everything.

193
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,280
Don't follow in your dad's footsteps.

194
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,240
You're too young to be charged,
but we can't leave it at that.

195
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,320
Take responsibility.

196
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,080
I've asked Mr. Callegari
about the most appropriate punishment.

197
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,400
As soon as he replies,
you and I will have a chat. Understood?

198
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,920
What if he doesn't reply?

199
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,680
I'll visit his store.

200
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,400
Please.

201
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,440
Hello.

202
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,240
Guédira!

203
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,400
I underestimated you. I was wrong.

204
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
How are you? Not too hard going?

205
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
-Good job!
-What are we doing here?

206
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,280
Where's Sernine?

207
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,440
All right, listen.

208
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,360
The case went all the way to the top.

209
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,840
We can't let him mock us anymore.

210
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,480
People in high places want results.

211
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,120
I need to take care of this case
personally.

212
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,160
Additionally,
I've received new information.

213
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,080
We believe the kid is in danger.

214
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
What information?

215
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,920
It's confidential.

216
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,760
All I can tell you, anyway,
is that with me the kid is safe.

217
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,800
Thanks, Guédira.

218
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,160
Wait.

219
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,920
I don't understand.

220
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,800
Hang on now.

221
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,000
Do I need to convince you
to obey my order?

222
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,520
Raoul, come here please.

223
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,520
I'm going to leave you
with Commissioner Dumont.

224
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
I want to go home
and see my mother.

225
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,040
Don't you worry, young man.
It's almost over.

226
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,040
Hello?

227
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,720
-Dad? I'm at the Hyatt Hotel.
-Raoul?

228
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,560
Don't worry, I'm on my way! You OK?
Did they hurt you?

229
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,920
Raoul?

230
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,480
Look at me.

231
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,920
-What's your name?
-Raoul.

232
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,840
Raoul.

233
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,920
I'm Hubert.

234
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,120
Hubert Pellegrini.

235
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,920
I'm holding a fundraising gala
for children like you.

236
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,520
-Like me?
-Kids whose parents are criminals.

237
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,680
-My parents aren't like that.
-Yeah?

238
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,680
Tell me,
what does your father do for a living?

239
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,240
You don't know?

240
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,920
I'll tell you.

241
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,480
What his father did before him.
He steals.

242
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,440
-That's not true!
-He's a thief. Arrogant.

243
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,480
-That's a lie.
-He doesn't care about you or your mom.

244
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
You're lying!

245
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,080
You're right.

246
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,040
Your father's on his way.

247
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,680
Don't worry.

248
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,080
You'll soon be reunited.

249
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,320
Guédira?

250
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,560
I was looking for you. This is for you.

251
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
-Thanks.
-See you.

252
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
THANK YOU GANIMARD

253
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,920
Thank you.

254
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,360
Dear friends, dear peers,
join me in welcoming

255
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,280
the president of the foundation,
Juliette Pellegrini.

256
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,280
Bravo!

257
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,120
-Bravo!
-Thank you.

258
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,040
Thank you.

259
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,320
Good evening all.

260
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,640
Not everyone has had the opportunity
to have access to culture

261
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,600
the way I did.

262
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
I was able to visit
the most beautiful museums,

263
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,440
attend the most wonderful operas.

264
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,240
There were no limits with my father,
as you can imagine.

265
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,160
Culture should be accessible to all,
with no distinctions.

266
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,480
That's the mission of this foundation.

267
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,840
The reason for which
we're reaching out to you today.

268
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,560
Not hungry?

269
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,720
Your loss. It's good.

270
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,720
Hey.

271
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,360
Never seen so much money in a single room.
It's crazy.

272
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,640
Thank you.

273
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,320
Keep it.

274
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,880
-I'm trying to quit.
-Thanks.

275
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,240
OK, copy that.

276
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,560
Sir?

277
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,400
Hey, sir!

278
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,800
It's him.

279
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,360
We've seen him in the basement.

280
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,320
He doesn't stand a chance.

281
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,560
Don't move!

282
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,960
The suspect's in the basement.
Close the kitchens, access to the floors.

283
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,880
I should find it fair

284
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,560
if this young man were to be punished
as severely as possible.

285
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,400
Keep me posted. Thanks. Have a nice day.

286
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,920
You destroy the tape.

287
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,560
It won't change anything.

288
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,800
Mr. Bouchard will go to the store
if he doesn't get an answer.

289
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,800
That'd be even worse.

290
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,760
I know.

291
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,360
The foundation's launch party
will take place in a few weeks.

292
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,040
We will have the privilege
of attending a symphony orchestra.

293
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,840
-Yes, sir?
-Dumont…

294
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,280
-We've lost him.
-Is he still in the building?

295
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,280
Knowing him,
he won't just give up like that.

296
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,800
Get the kid out of here.

297
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,640
What? Are you sure?

298
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,880
We've lost control.
The child is our only card.

299
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,440
We can't risk losing him.

300
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
-Evacuate him from the hotel.
-Yes.

301
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,280
A car will be waiting for you.

302
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,040
My men will take the child
to a secured place.

303
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,720
OK, sir.

304
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,080
Yes, hello?

305
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,640
The car is here.

306
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,640
In the parking lot.

307
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Are you there?

308
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yes, we are, sir.

309
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
-The black van?
-That's right.

310
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,520
-Once the car has left, come find me.
-Yes.

311
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,880
Go on.

312
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,040
I have to take my leave.

313
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,480
HUBERT PELLEGRINI

314
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,200
-Yes?
-The situation's serious.

315
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,160
We fell victim to a terrible injustice.

316
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,000
-What?
-The foundation was robbed.

317
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,760
We refuse to be intimidated.

318
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,520
What's going on?

319
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,560
-I don't understand.
-Come with me.

320
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,880
This is awesome! The voice!

321
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,920
This is sick.

322
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,280
Hi, this is Lorenzo Callegari.

323
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,720
I received your letter.

324
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,840
To be honest, I've thought it through.

325
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,600
Everyone makes mistakes.

326
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,040
This young man deserves a second chance.

327
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,200
Besides, I've got my violin back.

328
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,200
It's in perfect condition.
Let's leave it at that.

329
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,960
Thank you, and have a nice day.

330
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,880
It's worked?

331
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,400
The principal has never heard
Lorenzo's voice. I'm hoping.

332
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,520
A few weeks ago, we fell victim

333
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,040
to a terrible injustice.

334
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,440
The foundation was robbed.

335
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,800
We fell victim to a terrible injustice,
Dumont. The foundation was robbed.

336
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,440
The foundation was robbed.

337
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,600
The foundation was robbed.

338
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,600
The foundation was robbed.

339
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,640
Get the kid out of here.

340
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,960
-What? Are you sure?
-We've lost control.

341
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,640
The child's our only card.

342
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,360
-We fell victim to a terrible injustice.
-What?

343
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,760
Our foundation was robbed.
We refuse to be intimidated.

344
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,000
Are you really a thief?
That's why they kidnapped me?

345
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,160
You're old enough to understand now.

346
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,240
25 years ago,
Pellegrini framed my dad as a thief.

347
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,760
And today…

348
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,880
he's targeting you.

349
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,800
He'll pay for that.

350
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,800
How far will you go, Dad?

351
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,680
-Mom says you'll never change.
-I will.

352
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,120
Once this has been sorted out.

353
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,840
I promise things will change.

354
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,040
You know what…

355
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,600
If you want me to stop, tell me.

356
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,040
I'll stop everything.

357
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,480
No.

358
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,720
Keep going.

359
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
I love you, son.

360
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,800
I love you too, Dad.

361
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,680
Let's go home.

362
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
24 HOURS EARLIER

FORMER INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST

364
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
HER FIGHT GOES ON

365
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,160
Excuse me. May I take your newspaper?

366
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,600
Thank you.

FORMER JOURNALIST COMMITS SUICIDE
HER FIGHT GOES ON

368
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,160
-Why would I know about that?
-You've always known about everything.

369
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,280
Listen, Ben.

370
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,600
Raoul has been kidnapped.

371
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,600
I think Pellegrini did it.

372
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
I need your help.

373
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,800
He's going to find Raoul.

374
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,800
-He always finds a way out.
-Not this time.

375
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,480
Please.

376
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,160
I want to find my son.

377
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,560
-The voice was identical, I swear!
-All right, Dumont!

378
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,720
One thing I learned in business,

379
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,200
you always need a back-up.

380
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,840
Have a drink on me, Dumont.

381
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,200
You don't intimidate me.

382
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,440
Taking my son is the worst you could do.

383
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,960
I want my child. You want your necklace.

384
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,000
So, I want to make you an offer.

385
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,640
Which is?

386
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,040
I get my son back, you get the rest.

387
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,840
I don't want the necklace.

388
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,880
I want Assane.

389
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,080
Open the door,
and go inside your room. OK?

390
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,520
OK?

391
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,840
Just one moment with my son.

392
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,560
Mom?

393
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,000
Mom?

394
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,080
Run.
