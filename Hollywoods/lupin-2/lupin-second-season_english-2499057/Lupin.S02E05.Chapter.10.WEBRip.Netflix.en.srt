00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,800
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,720
Be careful, please.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,000
What's all this stuff?

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,520
It's to track the donations.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,880
Everyone can donate
via an app connected to this system.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,360
I know nothing about this.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,160
I'm not surprised.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,480
I said, be careful. That's fragile.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,880
-Hello.
-Oblet. Hello.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,440
Shall we?

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,760
All entrances are under surveillance.
Staff members and musicians are vetted.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,000
-All the guests will be searched.
-Good. But stay on guard.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,240
-Diop could show up.
-You think so?

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,800
-You should be prepared for anything.
-So I heard.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
I'll be in the audience.

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,320
-Let me know if there are any issues.
-There won't be any.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,440
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Good evening, sir.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,040
See you later.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,680
We're not done decorating.
You'll have to imagine it.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,680
I can show you how it'll unfold.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,200
A screen will come down
behind the orchestra.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,920
Images will be projected
during the concert, as requested.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,480
The posters you sent me will be
on the front of the theater.

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,760
Ms. Pellegrini,
you'll be on the first balcony.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,200
-And the computer equipment?
-On its way.

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,640
There it is.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,440
Perfect. Thanks.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
-Where will you be sitting?
-Up there.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,360
OK. I'll stand watch by the door.

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,320
-Do you think Diop might show up?
-Diop is a showman.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,880
He's thirsty for revenge.

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,080
The question isn't whether he'll come…

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,360
but when.

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,800
Babakar Diop?

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,240
Follow me.

36
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,360
I need someone
who gives a good impression.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,560
And who shows up on time. It's important.

38
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,880
Absolutely, sir.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,560
I'm wary of people who show up late.

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,320
And those who show up early.

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,000
I need someone trustworthy.

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,120
Of course. That's a minimum requirement.

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,080
This person will be able to trust me
in return.

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,160
What's your name?

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,840
Babakar, sir.

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,040
Babakar Diop.

47
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,680
Babakar, you may go.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,720
Tell my assistant
to put an end to the interviews.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,480
I've found the person I need.

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,520
Thank you, sir.

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,120
THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE CONCERT

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,960
I'm in the hallway.

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,160
Entering the office.

54
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,440
There's something on the desk.

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
Shit.

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,760
Looks interesting, huh?

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
Perfect.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,240
See if you can get something.

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,760
OK.

60
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,440
That's nice.

61
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,760
Come on.

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
"Lu…"

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,160
"Lucas…"

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
"Lucas La…"

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,840
"Lucas Lacroix."

66
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,000
Lucas Lacroix.

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680
Hi, Mr. Pellegrini.

68
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120
Hello.

69
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,440
I've come to update you
on your investments.

70
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,840
Let's make this quick.

71
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,320
Of course, sir.

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,320
How are things?

73
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,760
Have you earned me money?

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
No, but--

75
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,640
Have you lost me money?

76
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,800
-No, but--
-So, what's the point of this meeting?

77
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
We make this commitment
to all our clients.

78
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,360
Next time, just send me
my account balance. It'll be quicker.

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,280
Very well.

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,040
Lucas Lacroix is a wealth manager.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
For people with vast fortunes.

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,400
He's known for safe investments.
Stable returns.

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,640
To do that,
he needs access to his client's data.

84
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,080
The keys to the account. Usernames.

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,520
Bank account number,
passwords, login details.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,120
He keeps this data inside a briefcase.

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,280
If we want info on Pellegrini,
we need that briefcase.

88
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
Great. Good job.

89
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,520
Anytime.

90
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,280
Are you OK?

91
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,920
-Are you OK?
-My briefcase, please.

92
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,160
Hey! Help me get my briefcase back!

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,440
-Sir!
-Help me!

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
-Come on.
-We have what we need?

95
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,320
Dummy company financial statements,
offshore accounts, taxes…

96
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,680
All good. Let's go.

97
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,480
All good! He let go of it.

98
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,480
-Thank you so much.
-It's normal.

99
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,040
Have a nice day, Lucas.

100
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,240
We need help.

101
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,200
What do you mean?

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,440
An accomplice.

103
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,600
Yeah.

104
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,520
-This is where you think you'll find them?
-Yeah.

105
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,720
Over there.

106
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,160
They have the finest Lupin editions.

107
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,560
This accomplice is going to come to us.

108
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,000
There are tons of Lupin enthusiasts.

109
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
Tons of candidates.

110
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
What do you want?

111
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
Sorry?

112
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,400
You're pretending to read

113
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,360
and your friend is holding
his book upside down.

114
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,360
So, what do you want?

115
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,200
Here.

116
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,360
Hubert Pellegrini's the target.

117
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,640
The wealthiest man in France.
We'll have to be clever.

118
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,560
-We did our research.
-He can't turn you down.

119
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,360
This man's closely protected.

120
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,680
You must make him think
his strategy is wrong.

121
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,720
Lure him with rewarding investments.

122
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
A two-figure return.

123
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,200
-We have confidential information.
-He's obsessed with money.

124
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,920
We know about every deal.

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,600
-His stock portfolio.
-He's invested in North Africa.

126
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,560
-Real estate in Asia.
-He's everywhere.

127
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,600
Luxury, beauty products, media,
shipping, energy, telecoms.

128
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,480
The biggest financial centers.
He's distrustful.

129
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,320
-We'll give you a new identity.
-A financial expert.

130
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,120
You'll need to be convincing. Job done.

131
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,440
One now, and another when the job is done.

132
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,400
Works for me.

133
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
Up to par on financial markets?

134
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
-We can't screw this up.
-We won't.

135
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,160
I don't think
Lupin's ever had such an opponent.

136
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,400
Now you need a name.

137
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,200
-A Lupin reference?
-No, it's too risky.

138
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,880
Something connected to him.

139
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,920
What comes to mind?

140
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,280
Courbet. It's Lupinesque, isn't it?

141
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
The Étretat cliffs, Courbet's painting…

142
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
Good idea.

143
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,080
That's settled.
Now we need to introduce Courbet.

144
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,880
Hello?

145
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,600
-Yes, Lucas?
-Yes?

146
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
Pierre Lafont, from Brussels.

147
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,760
Yes, hello.

148
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,120
We have a report
from the Financial Markets Regulator.

149
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,600
A broker based in Paris is trying
to approach our clients.

150
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,440
An efficient but disreputable method.

151
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,640
Yes, I see.

152
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,080
I wanted to warn you against him.

153
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,400
Yes, hold on…

154
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,880
I'm writing this down.

155
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,840
His name is Philippe Courbet.

156
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,560
-That's all, thank you. Goodbye.
-Yes. Goodbye.

157
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,400
Nice job!

158
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,800
Yes? What is it?

159
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,560
Mr. Pellegrini? This is Mr. Lacroix.

160
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,400
Yes, hello, Lacroix…

161
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,720
Sorry to disturb you.

162
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,040
I've received confidential information

163
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,840
from a colleague in Brussels.

164
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,320
That's fine. Well?

165
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,320
A broker's trying to approach our clients.
Be wary of him.

166
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,000
-And why is that?
-Yes…

167
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,680
He's had some good results,
but his methods are questionable.

168
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,280
Good thing you warned me.

169
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,240
He might try to contact you.
Best to warn you.

170
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,960
-You never know.
-What was his name again?

171
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,440
Yes. Philippe Courbet.

172
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,680
Courbet.

173
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,720
-Like the painter. Thanks, Lacroix.
-OK--

174
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,000
We can optimize your investments
by diversifying your equity portfolio.

175
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm listening.

176
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,400
Real estate investments,
assets in North Africa…

177
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,160
That works for a while.
We can do much better.

178
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,120
How do you know about my business?

179
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,040
It's my job to know who I'm dealing with.

180
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,080
Well, part of my job.

181
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,200
And the other part?

182
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,560
The other part is
to make wealthy people even wealthier.

183
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,560
I have some ideas for you.

184
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,040
Which are?

185
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,560
Tell me more
about this concert for your foundation.

186
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,480
This event will draw
different types of people.

187
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,240
-Are you going to get inside as an usher?
-No.

188
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,240
-A stage manager?
-No.

189
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,520
A hairdresser? A violinist?
You can't just go inside.

190
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,280
You are wanted for murder.

191
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,920
Stop panicking.

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,960
If we all play our part,
everything will go well.

193
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,720
Nice of you to visit your old man.

194
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,760
This is so nice.

195
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,480
Seriously,
we should have a house like this.

196
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,200
Not just yet.

197
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,640
But in the meantime… Here.

198
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,960
-What's this?
-Open it. It's a present.

199
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,800
You serious?

200
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,840
Dad, how did you manage this?

201
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,880
I got my first paycheck.

202
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,040
It's awesome.

203
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,080
No. Stop…

204
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,240
Just one!

205
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,880
-One picture.
-Give it.

206
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,520
-Let's take a photo together. Stand there.
-OK.

207
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,200
Here it is.

208
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,960
It's all here.

209
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,960
Perfect.

210
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,920
-And your delivery guys?
-It's all good.

211
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
I need one more.

212
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm ready.

213
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,920
Here. You'll be perfect.

214
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,480
And the box?

215
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,520
It's here.

216
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,640
I said, be careful. It's fragile.

217
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,160
The posters will be projected
on the face of the theater.

218
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,320
You'll be sitting on the first balcony.

219
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,000
And the computer equipment?

220
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,880
There it is. It's right there.

221
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,920
Perfect. Thanks.

222
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,000
What are all these boxes?

223
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,680
The computers to wire the donations.

224
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,640
Why is it taking up so much room?
This isn't the '80s anymore.

225
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,720
It's the hard drives that take up space.

226
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,640
Do you want to check one?

227
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,800
Go ahead.

228
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,000
You want to open another one?

229
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,120
There are 15 more inside the truck.

230
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Fine. Go ahead.

231
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,000
We have a problem. The guy was strangled.

232
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,760
The murderer stepped on the victim's coat
and left a footprint.

233
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,760
It's a size 42 Timberland.

234
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,600
Great. So what?

235
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,040
So, Diop is a 46.

236
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,320
OK. Thank you.

237
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,040
Shit.

238
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,520
We've found a footprint for the murderer.

239
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
It doesn't match Diop's.

240
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,160
What's with that face?

241
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,720
What?

242
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,080
Tell me why you framed Babakar,
and we'll forget about it.

243
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,120
-Now do you get it?
-Go to hell.

244
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,800
Last chance, Dumont.

245
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,120
-Dumont.
-Yeah.

246
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,320
-You want to rat me out? OK.
-Dumont.

247
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,680
I took the cash.
But I didn't spend it on watches or coke.

248
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,800
The money was for my kids.

249
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,200
What's going on?

250
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,360
I have a video you need to see.

251
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,960
OK.

252
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,560
Listen. The guy who was murdered
in Diop's place…

253
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,720
The guy from Le Havre.

254
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,960
OK. He had a weapon
registered to this address…

255
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,000
This address is registered to Pellegrini.

256
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,080
His name's Léonard Koné.

257
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,960
Look. His name pops up here.

258
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,600
In Babakar Diop's case.

259
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,640
They were in prison together.

260
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,880
When Diop confessed to
stealing the necklace. And guess what?

261
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,960
Dumont was in charge of the case.

262
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,160
When you arrested Koné at Le Havre,
he wouldn't let you question him.

263
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm telling you.
Koné, Pellegrini, Dumont are connected.

264
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,080
Look.

265
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,680
This is Koné at Le Havre.

266
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,800
And this is him in 1995.

267
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,920
He was convicted for attempted murder.

268
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,640
That's why Dumont wanted you off the case.

269
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,880
-You were getting close.
-Yeah.

270
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,760
Remember how he insisted
Pellegrini be released?

271
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,200
This doesn't look good.

272
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,560
The Pellegrini foundation is holding
a concert.

273
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,760
He'll be there.

274
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,400
We have to arrest him. Boss or not.

275
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,680
We're at the Théâtre du Châtelet

276
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,200
for what many are calling
the year's biggest charity event,

277
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,520
with the country's largest fortunes
gathered here.

278
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,280
One individual is drawing
all the attention.

279
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,000
Assane Diop is still on the run
and cannot be located at this time.

280
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,720
Is the man wanted for murder
and for stealing the Queen's necklace

281
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,040
going to show up tonight,
as he did during another event

282
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,280
held by the Pellegrini foundation?

283
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,600
Ready?

284
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,760
Ready.
The musicians will walk on stage soon.

285
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,200
Juliette and her father will be out too.

286
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,840
Pellegrini will be there.

287
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,360
Second balcony. You see?

288
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
The computer is ready
to transfer donations

289
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
to Pellegrini's account.

290
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,880
This screen shows
how much money is being collected.

291
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,960
OK.

292
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,280
Let's do it.

293
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,480
Hey, buddy.

294
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
It's gonna be OK.

295
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,080
Calm and methodical, as usual.

296
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm the nervous one. Don't forget.

297
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,000
-See you soon.
-See you.

298
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,720
You look gorgeous.

299
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,400
I'm proud of you.

300
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Everyone's ready whenever you are.

301
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,640
I'm coming.

302
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,960
There he is.

303
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,680
-Come on!
-Sorry. Let's go.

304
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,360
Excuse me. Your invitations, please.

305
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,640
Sorry. Go ahead.

306
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Juliette Pellegrini.

307
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,680
Thank you. Good evening, all.

308
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,000
It is a great honor for me
to welcome you tonight,

309
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,920
and present you the foundation's work.

310
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Through your donations,
you could fund scholarships,

311
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,320
cultural activities

312
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
for children
who don't normally have access to them.

313
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,440
And tonight,

314
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,840
we have the great privilege
of attending a concert

315
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,840
by the prestigious
French Symphony Orchestra,

316
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,720
conducted by Mathieu Lamboley.

317
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,680
They have accepted to perform for free,
as a show of support for the foundation.

318
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,160
Please applaud them.

319
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,160
You think Diop will show?

320
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,880
Don't know. Half the room is here for him.

321
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,200
Thank you again.

322
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,040
I'm moved to see
that you have answered our call.

323
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,280
-Good evening.
-Evening.

324
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,280
This foundation exists thanks to you.

325
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,160
I know how much
you care about and believe in education.

326
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm now appealing to your generosity

327
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,600
by encouraging you to make donations.

328
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,360
An app was created just for this purpose.

329
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,800
All you need to do now
is connect to it and donate.

330
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,000
Donate to your father…

331
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,320
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

332
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,280
PLEASE ENTER AND VALIDATE YOUR DONATION

333
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,560
TOTAL AMOUNT

334
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,800
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

335
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,440
Always the same with you.
You claim the best seat just for yourself.

336
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,240
-What do you want?
-A single word.

337
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,520
The truth.

338
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,120
Don't make me.

339
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,040
-I have nothing to say.
-It's going to hurt.

340
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,120
A shame to get blood on that suit.

341
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,800
I have men everywhere. You won't make it.

342
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,000
Neither will you.

343
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,080
-Quit being polite. We know each other.
-Unfortunately.

344
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,280
Fabienne Bériot.

345
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,720
-You killed her?
-She committed suicide.

346
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,080
Don't lie.

347
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,320
I didn't kill her.

348
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,160
-Léonard did.
-On your orders.

349
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,080
We can't ask him.

350
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,560
Don't fuck with me.
He was working for you.

351
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,480
You made him kidnap my son.

352
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,040
Without harming him.
Children are sacred to me.

353
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,080
It was me you wanted. Not my son.

354
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,600
-See? I'm here.
-Yes, from behind, like a coward.

355
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,760
It's my turn now, man.
What goes around comes around.

356
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,880
You wanted to kill me?

357
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,000
Words!

358
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,200
Speak. The truth.

359
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,200
The truth.
What will you do with the truth?

360
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,800
We're both here together,
but my men will get you.

361
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,000
You'll take the truth to your grave.
It'll be a nice shroud.

362
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,360
Worry about your grave first.

363
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,760
You answer "yes" or "no."
You wanted to kill me?

364
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,520
Of course.

365
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,800
But you screwed up.
You framed me for Léonard's murder.

366
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,000
-You could say that.
-Who killed him?

367
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,960
Pascal Oblet.

368
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,760
Good.

369
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,880
That's good.

370
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,400
And now…

371
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,240
My father.

372
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,720
You framed him. Talk.

373
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,920
Talk!

374
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,360
I hired Babakar
to frame him for the necklace.

375
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,880
-For the insurance money.
-Yes.

376
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,640
-Yes, what?
-Yes, I wanted the insurance money!

377
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,840
Then I sent Léonard to kill your father.

378
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,480
I had no choice.
He never would've let it go.

379
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,040
So, what are you going to do, Assane?
Are you going to go to the police?

380
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,120
No one will believe you.
Just like no one believed your father.

381
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,480
Diop!

382
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,960
Diop is in the building!

383
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,480
Everyone take a floor.
You take the upper level!

384
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,200
It's him!

385
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,880
Hey!

386
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,680
He's there!

387
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,000
Don't move or I'll shoot!

388
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,240
OK. You win. I surrender.

389
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,040
-Don't move.
-Just so you know…

390
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,160
Your trigger safety is on. I'll remove it.

391
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,720
Keep that thing pointed at me. No worries.
It's fine.

392
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,760
Can I remove it?

393
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Easy. Look.

394
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,080
It's off.

395
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,000
Dammit! Fuck!

396
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,040
Come on!

397
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,640
Sorry.

398
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,120
Diop!

399
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,440
Come on!

400
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,840
Go around!

401
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,320
HE'S INSIDE

402
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,320
Diop is inside. Find him.

403
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Emergency response team. Come on!

404
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,040
Go!

405
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,080
-Let's go, guys!
-All together!

406
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,160
Stop or I'll shoot!

407
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,520
Lower your weapon, Dumont.

408
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,800
-What?
-We know everything.

409
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,080
Come on!

410
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,880
Come on!

411
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,280
Don't move, Diop!

412
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,200
Let him go.

413
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,440
You're under arrest for corruption,
influence peddling.

414
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,240
What? He's our target!

415
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,760
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

416
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,720
Juliette.

417
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,880
Sorry to spoil the party. I had no choice.

418
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,760
You all need to know.

419
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,160
Babakar Diop, my father,
never stole that necklace.

420
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,440
Approaching target.

421
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,800
Hubert Pellegrini falsely accused him.

422
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,720
Even worse…

423
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,960
Wait for my order.

424
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,400
He ordered to have him killed.
Fabienne Bériot too.

425
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
He even kidnapped my son.

426
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,920
Ready.

427
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,560
Juliette, you need to know this.

428
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,120
We're ready.

429
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,280
He stole from you.

430
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,160
The money was embezzled.

431
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,440
Let's go!

432
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,480
Don't move. You're under arrest.

433
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,680
Curtain.

434
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,200
BEGIN TRANSFER

435
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,120
Ladies and gentlemen, please do not rush.

436
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,080
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm.

437
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,680
UNLOCKED

438
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,320
Here.

439
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,880
It's yours. As promised.

440
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,800
Do you have lots like this?

441
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,000
It's the last one.

442
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,120
I have one question.

443
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,560
Why give Pellegrini all that money?

444
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,400
9 million euros.

445
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,080
Yes. But that account isn't Pellegrini's.

446
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,960
-Is it Assane's?
-No.

447
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,080
The foundation's.

448
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,640
Aren't we waiting for Assane?

449
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,040
Don't worry. He'll figure it out.

450
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,800
FIRE PROTECTION

451
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Excuse me?

452
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,320
The guy you're after… He's on the roof.

453
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,880
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

454
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,320
-OK. Let's go.
-Get him.

455
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,320
Go on. Yeah.

456
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,360
Get him.

457
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,560
All units. Diop is heading for the roof.

458
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,240
All units. Diop is on the roof.

459
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,120
Théâtre du Châtelet. Evacuate.

460
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,320
Let's go.

461
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,040
VOICE MESSAGE

462
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,320
My father. You framed him. Talk.

463
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,560
I hired Babakar
to frame him for the necklace.

464
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,520
-For the insurance money?
-Yes.

465
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,360
-Yes, what?
-Yes, I wanted the insurance money!

466
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,080
What?

467
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
please head to the emergency exits.

468
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,840
No rushing.

469
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Yeah. I think he's up on the roof.

470
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,520
-Sixth floor. I saw him.
-Thank you.

471
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,800
He's not getting out.

472
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,000
Hey, guys.

473
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,760
-Come.
-What is it?

474
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Dammit, it's him!

475
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,400
Come on!

476
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,120
Hurry up!

477
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,520
Come on!

478
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,240
Stop!

479
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,000
Come on, guys! Get him!

480
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,000
Stop!

481
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,000
Come on.

482
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,080
Let's go!

483
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,080
Shit! He's getting away!

484
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,920
He's the greatest burglar

485
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,080
Yes, but he's a gentleman

486
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,160
He'll take what matters to you

487
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,680
Without using a weapon

488
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,280
When he robs a woman

489
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,160
He gives her flowers

490
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,680
The gentleman burglar

491
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,000
Is a noble man

492
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,640
He shows up at night
But won't disturb your sleep

493
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,200
He will quietly unhook the painting
You bought the day before

494
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,320
Before he goes

495
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,080
Once he's done with his guilty deeds

496
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,200
He'll leave a note on the piano

497
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,120
The date.

498
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,960
I forgot.

499
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,280
Marius Jacob was born
on September 29, 1879.

500
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,720
We just went over this.

501
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,800
What's that?

502
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,200
It's not here.

503
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,920
In your room.

504
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,520
Are you sure?

505
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,760
What is this thing?

506
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,760
Has to be your father.

507
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,240
Not here.

508
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,280
You stole from the Musée d'Orsay.

509
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,600
You can steal a bracelet from your ex.

510
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,960
Got it.

511
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,400
Hang on.

512
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,880
I don't know how to turn it off.

513
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
"Raoul's bridge?" What's that?

514
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,360
The bridge where your father and I decided
to name you Raoul.

515
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,960
Awesome. Let's go.

516
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,480
No. Out of the question.

517
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,440
Why?
Dad's asking us to meet him. Let's go.

518
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,080
No, we're not going.

519
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,520
I'm going.

520
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,080
Raoul, wait!

521
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,640
Mr. Pellegrini, you're under arrest
for abducting Raoul Diop,

522
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,680
and the murder of Fabienne Bériot
and Babakar Diop.

523
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,400
10:00 p.m.

524
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,560
Where is he?

525
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,160
You hear that?

526
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,040
Look!

527
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,240
Dad!

528
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,800
Raoul!

529
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,800
Dad!

530
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,240
It's good you came. Both of you.

531
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
Is this it?

532
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,040
Is it over?

533
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,040
Yeah. It's over.

534
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,440
But you were right.

535
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,560
-I'm causing you problems.
-We don't give a damn about that.

536
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,320
I only ever think of myself.

537
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,640
I have to go. Far away from you.

538
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,720
We don't want to lose you.
That's all that matters.

539
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,120
I'll be back.

540
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,200
When?

541
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,960
Don't worry.

You won't see me,

00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,280

00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,200
You too.

545
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,120
I love you both.
