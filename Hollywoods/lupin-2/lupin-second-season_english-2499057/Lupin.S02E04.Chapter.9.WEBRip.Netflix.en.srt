00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,840
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Are you OK?

3
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,000
-Are you OK?
-My briefcase.

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,520
Help me! I need my briefcase!

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,520
-Help me!
-Sir!

6
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,680
It's all good!

7
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,760
He let go of it.

8
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,520
Thank you so much.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,680
-Make sure nothing's missing.
-Yes.

10
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,320
It's all here. Thank you, truly.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,360
You're welcome.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,440
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day, Lucas.

13
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,320
You're taking huge risks by doing this.

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,200
You're aware

15
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,480
that this could cost you your career?

16
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,160
Might not be such a bad thing.

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,800
Phones aren't allowed.

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,440
-Just in case Albert calls me back.
-Albert?

19
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
Fontan.

20
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,440
The Interior Minister. He's a friend.

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,680
Mr. Pellegrini…

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,320
You are in custody for fraud and perjury.

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,560
Answer our questions.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
So, the insurance contract
for the necklace?

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,440
You should talk if you know something.

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,560
I don't.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,680
I have done nothing wrong.

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,960
After the necklace was stolen in 1995,

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,160
you received 118 million francs
in insurance.

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,960
You'd intended to sell it
for three times that.

31
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,000
-A lot of money.
-So what?

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,280
I don't decide the art market prices.

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,920
Besides, I gave the insurance money back.

34
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,920
This man.

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Do you know him?

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,640
Of course I do.

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,880
He stole the necklace,
just like his father back then. Diop.

38
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,400
Is Diop his real name?

39
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,280
His name is Assane Diop.

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,400
We arrested him in Normandy.

41
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,760
He managed to escape.

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,760
What about him? Do you know him?

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,120
It's a simple question. Do you know him?

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,120
I'm thinking. Is that allowed?

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
I meet many people.

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,880
He was arrested with a firearm.

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,080
Purchased under a fake name,

48
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,520
with an address in Paris, near Pigalle.

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,960
We discovered that you own that apartment.

50
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,760
So? I own many properties across Paris.

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,320
I don't know my tenants' names.

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,840
He used a fake name. Do you know why?

53
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,760
Ask him.

54
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,600
We will.

55
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,320
We believe he tried
to kidnap Diop's son in Normandy.

56
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,400
Who is this guy?

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,160
How long have you known him?

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,400
You should answer our questions.

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Otherwise, you'll be in hot water.

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,480
Yes, hello?

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Nice of you to call me back.

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,480
Yes.

63
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
I'll put him on.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,120
The Interior Minister wants to talk
to you.

65
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,640
Yes? Hello, Mr. Minister.

66
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,000
He says we don't have enough
to keep Pellegrini in custody.

67
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,400
-We have to let him go.
-That's an abuse of power.

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,640
At least we have the name
of the guy we've been looking for.

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,200
Assane Diop.

70
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,000
-Are you OK?
-My father's been released.

71
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,400
That was predictable.

72
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,160
He knows people.

73
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
-What did you make me do?
-Calm down.

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,160
It'll be OK.

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,960
He'll find whoever talked to the police.

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,880
And that wasn't you.

77
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,760
The cop your mother spoke to
is a good guy. He won't talk.

78
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,080
My father always gets what he wants.
Even from good guys.

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
-I have to cancel the concert.
-No.

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,720
You can't.

81
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,600
I can't damage the foundation.

82
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,000
-If you cancel, he'll get suspicious.
-I'm sure he knows.

83
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,560
Juliette…

84
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,280
It will allow you to raise a lot of money

85
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
for the foundation and these kids' future.

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
Don't abandon them.

87
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,880
You can't let them down now.

88
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
If you do, your father wins.

89
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,560
-You're a good girl, Juliette.
-Yeah…

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,480
Yes.

91
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,720
-Sorry, I have to take this.
-Go ahead.

92
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,240
Hey.

93
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,600
It'll be OK. All right?

94
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,080
-Yes.
-See you later.

95
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,760
Fabienne Bériot was buried in Lille.

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,120
I called the morgue. I said
that I wanted to pay for the funeral…

97
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,280
-Someone had already taken care of it.
-Sure, it's not free.

98
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,800
She didn't have any friends.

99
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,520
I asked for the person's coordinates,
in order to thank them.

100
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,360
-They gave me his name.
-Diop.

101
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,880
No. B.T.A. Férel.

102
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,040
A company based in Saint-Ouen.
An antique dealer.

103
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,440
Benjamin Ferel.

104
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
He specializes in gemstones.

105
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,800
Good work.
Proof that Diop isn't working alone.

106
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,200
He's probably sent the police after me.

107
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,240
-I--
-Put him under surveillance.

108
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
If he knows Diop, he'll lead us to him.

109
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,480
-Let's do that.
-I'll set it up.

110
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,640
No. Leonard will handle it.

111
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,200
Diop is his case.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,320
Give him the details.

113
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,520
Thank you, gentlemen.

114
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
Pascal.

115
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,800
He has a lot to be forgiven for.

116
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,240
This is a golden opportunity for us.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
How so?

118
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Shut the door.

119
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,320
-Hello?
-I need you. It's urgent.

120
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,120
-Why?
-I can't do it anymore.

121
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,960
He barks
every time someone says "Pellegrini."

122
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,120
-He's at it again.
-Stop saying his name.

123
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,840
I tried. He figured it out.

124
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,280
The other day,
all I did was think of Pellegrini.

125
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,960
He barked.
He can read my mind.

126
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,960
He's scaring me.

127
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,400
I'll take him back. Meet me at my place.

128
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,920
Thanks.

129
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,040
I'm taking you back to your dad. Come on.

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,280
You and Assane have a child.

131
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,240
-Raoul. Is that right?
-Yes.

132
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,520
-So, you know where he lives.
-No.

133
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
You don't know where he lives?

134
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,320
Listen…

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,360
Assane is a rather discreet person,
you might say.

136
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
You see him regularly?

137
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,360
"Regularly" isn't part of his vocabulary.

138
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,640
You're going to wipe that smirk
off your face.

139
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
This is a police station.

140
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,520
We're not playing around.

141
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,840
-Who were the guys outside your building?
-Guys?

142
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,000
Waiting for your son.
They made me take him to the Hyatt hotel.

143
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,520
What did they look like?

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,360
Undercover police officers.

145
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,520
Did you check if they were?

146
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
Are you serious? Of course I did.

147
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,880
No one was sent to keep an eye on you.

148
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,320
-Listen…
-Who were they?

149
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,880
Sir, I would really love to help you,
but I…

150
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,560
I have nothing more to say.

151
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,240
These last few days have been hard on me.

152
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,400
I'm just happy to have my son back.

153
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
We'll post men outside your place,
in case Assane comes back.

154
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
If you want.
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.

155
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,600
He won't be back.

156
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,880
I don't want him to see my son.

157
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,800
Yeah. It's a great place.

158
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,560
Do you want some old Lupin editions?

159
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
-I like The Blonde Lady.
-I do too.

160
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,280
-Anything else?
-I don't know…

161
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,520
The Jewish Lamp.

162
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,880
That's a great one.

163
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,280
Awesome confrontation
between Sholmes and Lupin.

164
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
Yeah.

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,920
You all right?

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,040
I feel like
your messes are never going to end.

167
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,120
It's getting better.

168
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,720
-It's almost over.
-You always say that.

169
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,680
No.

170
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,680
You speak like your mother.

171
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,880
Is she with you?

172
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,480
No, I'm telling you, Dad.

173
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,920
I have to go. See you.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
Love you.

175
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,120
-Come on, J'accuse!
-Go on!

176
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,280
J'accuse!

177
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,480
-He's happy to see me.
-Not as happy as I am.

178
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,600
So, J'accuse?

179
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,120
You two don't get along, is that it?

180
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,880
I said she couldn't cancel.

181
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,840
-The children's future depends on it.
-You made her feel guilty.

182
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,960
No, I mean it.

183
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,520
We shouldn't prevent Juliette
from doing a good thing.

184
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,560
-I'm leaving.
-See you later.

185
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,920
Pellegrini!

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Right. Good luck.

187
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,880
Hello?
There's a fight at 12A, Trudaine Avenue.

188
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,680
Sounds violent. Send someone.

189
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,800
The owner of the place
is called Assane Diop.

190
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,320
Thanks.

191
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,480
Hello?

192
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,920
Yes…

193
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,760
Writing it down.

194
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,240
PASCAL - IT'S DONE

195
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,400
12A TRUDAINE AVENUE

196
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,040
Thanks.

197
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,880
Yes! We have Diop's address.
12A Trudaine Avenue.

198
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,720
Belkacem! What's the address?

199
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,040
Shit! Come on!

200
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,840
It's ready!

201
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,360
J'accuse?

202
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Looks like it.

203
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,440
Come on.

204
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,400
Come on! Let's go!

205
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,400
-I'll go in front!
-I'll take the stairs.

206
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,960
Let's return to today's main story.

207
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,360
A man found murdered
in the heart of Paris.

208
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,600
The police are looking…

209
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,560
Claire!

210
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,840
…for witnesses
to find the owner of the flat.

211
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,360
He's the main suspect in this case.
He's suspected of other crimes.

212
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,880
Yes? What?

213
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,520
-Notably, stealing the Queen's necklace.
-Look.

214
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,760
The suspect has been identified.

215
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,760
According to the police,
it is a man named Assane Diop.

216
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,960
An emergency number has been created

217
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,400
for anyone
with information about this fugitive.

218
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Resources are dedicated to
finding this individual.

219
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,000
The most wanted man in France tonight.

220
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,360
Assane, call me back right away.

221
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,000
He's the guy who was arrested
and released.

222
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,720
We were supposed to question him.

223
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,080
Yeah.

224
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,880
Looks like Diop struck first.

225
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,280
Look what I found.

226
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,440
The Louvre pen.

227
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Just look at him.

228
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,800
He's like a kid.

229
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,040
Laugier.

230
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,960
Be right back.

231
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
Hey? Stay focused, Guédira.

232
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,960
-Give us the room.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,480
-Shut the door.
-Of course.

234
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,800
-How did we find this?
-We got lucky.

235
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,640
Someone reported a fight.
Probably a neighbor.

236
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,120
He must have hurried off.

237
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
Good work, Laugier.

238
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,440
Listen, Laugier. Sensitive case.
I don't want people hearing about it.

239
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,440
I'd like us to restrict access
to the evidence in this case.

240
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,480
Only you and I will have access to it.

241
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,520
-Understood.
-Very well.

242
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,320
Reach out to me once you've secured it.

243
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,320
-I'm not taking the dog back.
-You haven't heard?

244
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,200
-What?
-You need to leave.

245
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,400
They know. Get your things. Go fast.

246
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,240
-Yes?
-Where are you now?

247
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,200
I don't know. I'm walking.

248
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,200
-Are you being followed?
-Don't think so.

249
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,880
They found my flat when they followed you.

250
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
So, make sure.

251
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,680
Shit, yes. There's a guy behind me.

252
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
I'm not sure.

253
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,880
OK. Don't turn around.

254
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,480
And be discreet. Stay calm.

255
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,240
Don't run. Don't panic.

256
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,120
Is there a bench?

257
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,680
-There's a bus stop.
-Perfect. Go there.

258
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,160
-Are you sitting down?
-Yes.

259
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,680
Is he gone?

260
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
No.

261
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,560
-Is he sitting next to you?
-Yes.

262
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,400
-Can he hear what you're saying?
-Yes.

263
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,600
Listen. A guy was killed in my place.
Chances are that guy is the murderer.

264
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,560
He might go after you, but don't worry.
He won't do anything here.

265
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,480
Reassuring.

266
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,080
Is there a bus?

267
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,840
Yes.

268
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,680
Get on it.

269
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,480
-OK.
-He will get up when you do.

270
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,920
-He's going to let you get on first.
-OK.

271
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,720
Hello.

272
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,640
Walk to the back.

273
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,520
Right before the bus leaves
and the doors close,

274
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,240
you get off.

275
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,200
OK.

276
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,240
Now!

277
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,360
All good. I got off.

278
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,400
He's gone.

279
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,320
I know.

280
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,080
Shit!

281
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,000
-What now?
-Now…

282
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,160
We disappear.

283
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,880
SUBWAY

284
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,320
You'll see. It's going to be awesome.

285
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,440
-Enjoy the tour. Bye.
-Bye.

286
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,080
-Hello. So…
-Two student tickets.

287
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,680
-Shouldn't you be at school?
-No…

288
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,880
It's for our history presentation
about the catacombs.

289
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,880
Sure.

290
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,880
OK. So, you need a map.

291
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,320
So many tunnels.

292
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,960
-The ones the public has access to.
-There are more?

293
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,000
Let me show you.

294
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,240
A cataphile drew this a few years ago.

295
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,240
These are the tunnels on your map
that everyone has access to.

296
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,080
And these are other tunnels,

297
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,000
which this specialist mapped out.

298
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,320
They have never been visited
because it's dangerous.

299
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,920
Can we borrow it?

300
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,720
OK. But you bring it back. Promise?

301
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,000
Of course, madam.

302
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Don't go in there. It's dangerous.

303
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,040
-No, don't worry.
-Of course.

304
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,080
-Right. Enjoy the tour.
-Thanks.

305
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,360
-Good day.
-Good day.

306
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,320
Bring it back, OK?

307
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,000
Hello.

308
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
Two tickets?

309
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,600
MURDER AND ROBBERY IN FRANCE
PORTRAIT OF A PUBLIC ENEMY

310
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,360
THIEF, MURDERER, MASTER OF ESCAPE

311
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,520
What's up with you?

312
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,800
ELUSIVE

313
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,720
You spent your time trying to tell us
that Diop was the new Lupin.

314
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,640
Now that we agree with you,
you're depressed.

315
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
That's the issue.

316
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,480
I don't know if I'm right.

317
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,560
I don't know if this guy's Arsène Lupin.

318
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,880
Of course. It's obvious.

319
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,400
He's obsessed with him.
The books, the costumes.

320
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,760
Commits the same crimes.
Just missing the top hat, the monocle.

321
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,200
You know about Lupin now?

322
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,720
Seriously. You were right from the start.

323
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,560
If you were an expert,
you'd know the issue.

324
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,520
-The guy we're looking for can't be Lupin.
-Why?

325
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,880
Lupin doesn't kill.

326
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,880
He's a gentleman burglar.

327
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,680
That's in the books, Guédira.

328
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,000
Lupin may not be a murderer, but Diop…

329
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,760
Well, Diop is.

330
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,240
Finally,
the manhunt for Assane Diop is ongoing.

331
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,320
-There's no trace of the fugitive.
-I don't know.

332
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,680
The man, described as cunning,
continues to evade the police.

333
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,240
The drama surrounding the manhunt
of Assane Diop has France on pins.

334
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,400
Investigators are hoping
to resolve this within days.

335
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,120
Sorry.

336
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,440
If someone finds us here…

337
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,480
Where did you find that phone?
Did you steal it?

338
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,560
Playing with fire.
You don't even know the PIN.

339
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,080
The guy was around 50…

340
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,120
So, that would be 1970… 1971…

341
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,720
Or 1969…

342
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,080
-There. Look.
-Are you serious? I can't believe this…

343
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,640
We were due some good luck.

344
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,080
B.T.A FÉREL, ANTIQUE DEALER
DIOP'S ACCOMPLICE

345
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,720
We're looking for his phone number.

346
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,760
Checking his bank account,
online transactions.

347
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,360
-Whatever helps locate him.
-Laugier.

348
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
Good. Keep it up.

349
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,600
-Is the evidence in a secure place?
-Yes.

350
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,120
Perfect. I have some information for you.

351
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,320
A shop at the flea market.

352
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,320
We think Diop was fencing goods there.

353
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
OK. I'm on it.

354
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,480
We need to check an address.
Belkacem, with me.

355
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,120
-Guédira, you stay.
-What?

356
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,240
-I need you here.
-But…

357
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,280
-He's Diop's accomplice.
-Where is he?

358
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,520
He must have left a clue somewhere.

359
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,280
Get this to the lab.

360
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,640
-OK.
-Thanks.

361
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,560
Old sneakers, a hair dryer,
there's nothing here, dammit!

362
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,840
I think I found something.

363
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,040
Over here.

364
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,720
There's a code. Figure it out.

365
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,640
Come on!

366
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,320
ASSANE DIOP:
THIEF, MURDERER AND MASTER OF ESCAPE

367
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,360
-What are you doing?
-Commenting on the news.

368
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,920
Stop it! We need to get out of Paris!

369
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
-I'm wanted for murder.
-Exactly!

370
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,880
Running away means
admitting guilt.

371
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,200
I'm not guilty.

372
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,320
I was framed like my dad.

373
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,880
Our plan for the Châtelet will prove
I'm innocent.

374
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,920
We didn't do all this for nothing.
We're ready.

375
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
We'll be safe here until the show.

376
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,640
Even if I tried to convince you,
you'd end up doing whatever you want.

377
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,560
Exactly.

378
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,560
We need to find number 12.

379
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,680
Calm down.

380
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,920
Stop drinking coffee.

381
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,120
It's too much. Makes you nervous.

382
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,800
What do we do?

383
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,120
It's closed.

384
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,680
ARSÈNE LUPIN VERSUS HERLOCK SHOLMES

385
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,480
You all right?

386
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,720
-What are you reading?
-Arsène Lupin.

387
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,880
Dad gave it to me.

388
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,440
Aren't you a little old?

389
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,400
No.

390
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,760
-What's it about?
-Depends on the book.

391
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,040
OK. The one you're reading?

392
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
The Blonde Lady.

393
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,880
About an escape.

394
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,640
Police! Nobody move!

395
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,640
Shit, what is this…

396
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,000
Is that it?

397
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,560
Thanks to the blonde lady,
Lupin has the plans to the buildings.

398
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,880
He's one step ahead.

399
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,520
Still warm. They were here not long ago.

400
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,760
Can't believe it.

401
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,640
He escapes
whenever he's about to get caught.

402
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,000
His accomplices too.

403
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,480
No matter where he is…

404
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,400
he always gets away.

405
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,080
Damn. What the hell is this?

406
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,680
Sounds good. I should give it a go.

407
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
NEW ARTICLE ABOUT ASSANE DIOP

408
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
THIEF, MURDERER AND MASTER OF ESCAPE

409
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,880
ONE MINUTE AGO

410
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,600
What are you telling me?

411
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,440
No. The…

412
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,160
The plam… The…

413
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,480
The lamp.

414
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,920
The lamp.

415
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,960
Je…

416
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,760
The lamp… The Jewish lamp!

417
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,200
THE JEWISH LAMP

418
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,960
The Jewish Lamp.

419
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,880
OK.

420
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,440
Oh, shit.

421
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,560
Hey? Stay focused, Guédira.

422
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,400
Thank you.

423
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,400
What the hell is this?

424
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,160
Boss.

425
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,600
What do we do?

426
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,040
Let's go.

427
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,360
Come on.

428
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,440
Come on, Belkacem.

429
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,120
Come on.

430
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,680
Dammit.

431
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,600
Boss!

432
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,480
I think there's someone there.

433
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,640
…the remains of more than
six million people from the cemeteries.

434
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,920
Police! Nobody move!

435
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,720
OK. Sorry.

436
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,160
Have you seen a tall Black man,

437
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,880
short hair, probably armed?

438
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,360
You mean Assane Diop?

439
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,320
-You get here through Denfert-Rochereau?
-Yes.

440
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,960
We need backup
near the Catacombs in the 14th district.

441
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,200
Call reception. No one comes down.

442
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,680
OK.

443
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,720
Don't let people in anymore.

444
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,920
Assane Diop is reportedly inside.

445
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,160
The Catacombs are now closed.

446
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,520
Move along. We are closed!

447
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,000
The Catacombs are closed.

448
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,760
Go home. Clear the area.
This is an emergency.

449
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,040
-Not there.
-Sure?

450
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,360
-We've been walking a while.
-I'm sure.

451
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,240
-Shit!
-Come on, Belkacem.

452
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,040
I heard them. We gotta move.

453
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,080
They're getting closer.

454
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,320
You recognize it now?

455
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Yeah. Well done.

456
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,720
It's here.

457
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,760
OK.

458
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,040
Go on. Come on.

459
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,400
This is so dope.

460
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,400
It's this way.

461
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,360
-We're going in.
-OK.

462
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,200
-You OK?
-Yeah.

463
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,400
Halfway there.

464
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,840
This way! Come on!

465
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,040
Look where it took us.

466
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,480
Come on. Hurry up.

467
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,320
-Here.
-It might be useful someday.

468
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,720
Let's go.

469
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,280
Ben.

470
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,560
For the blonde lady.

471
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,320
Here, madam. Like we promised.

472
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Thanks again.

473
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,920
What is this thing…

474
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,640
Dammit.

475
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,200
Yes!

476
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,320
To the origin of the world.

477
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,680
Money.

478
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,280
Yes?

479
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,200
Sir?

480
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,920
Dumont.

481
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,480
Can we speak in private?

482
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,760
We're all friends here.

483
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Have a seat.

484
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Sit down.

485
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,920
So, tell me.

486
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,680
We've gathered Assane Diop's things.

487
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,360
All that could lead back to us
is in a secure location.

488
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
-We just have to destroy it.
-Good.

489
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,880
OK.

490
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,480
What is this?

491
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,360
Damn.

492
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,760
And any charges held against you
will be dropped.

493
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,840
Perfect, Dumont.

494
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,160
Absolutely perfect.

495
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,400
You need to remain careful.

496
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,760
My men are asking questions.

497
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,520
I feel they're getting close.

498
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
What is this?

499
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,520
Relax, Dumont.

500
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,400
You only need to attend the concert.

501
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,000
Enjoy the moment…

502
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,120
The money is coming.

503
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,920
The beginning of a new life.

504
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,760
No…

505
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,200
You want to write, right?

506
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,360
He wants to write a book.

507
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,040
You can quit your job and get to it.

508
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,800
You deserve it, Dumont.

509
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,680
I really thought
we were going to get caught this time.

510
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,640
Yet here we are. We did it, Ben.

511
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,440
Yeah.

512
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,360
In 1911 the Théâtre du Châtelet featured
the first stage adaptation of Lupin.

513
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,320
Really?

514
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,480
Tomorrow, it'll be our turn.

515
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Our last show.

516
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,520
We'll be done with Pellegrini.
