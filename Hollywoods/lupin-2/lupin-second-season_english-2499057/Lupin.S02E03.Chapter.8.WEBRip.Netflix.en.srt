00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,480
Run.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,080
Run, Assane!

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,160
Where is he?

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,720
Guys!

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,360
Are you OK? Did they hurt you?

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,520
-Who were they?
-Answer me, please.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,840
I'm fine. Dad was awesome.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,760
No.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,600
-No, I can't let you say that.
-Why?

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,640
You can see why.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,760
He's dangerous.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,040
-He uses others. He stops at nothing.
-Not true.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,960
It is!

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,000
It's all his fault!

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,760
I don't want to hear about him anymore!
Understand?

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
I don't want him to come near us again.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,320
Do you understand?

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,960
He's never kept a promise.

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,480
We can't trust him anymore.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,600
This is the last time
he puts you in danger.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
You're in a great mood today.
What's going on?

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,360
Can't believe she's not answering.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,200
-She's his mother.
-And I'm his father.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,040
I haven't spoken to the kid in a week.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,880
She was desperate. That's normal.

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,800
No, it's not.

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,720
She ratted me out to Pellegrini.
She went too far.

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,920
Stop it. She had no choice.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,080
She warned you. She didn't give you up.

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,080
Good thing you're here to cheer me up.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,800
You're my best friend.

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,760
Comfort me. Don't tell me the truth.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,560
Buddy, you should be taking it out
on Pellegrini.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,640
So, what's the plan now?

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
Assane?

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,040
Don't worry.

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,840
Pellegrini went after my son.
I'll do the same.

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,560
We've got work to do.

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,080
Thanks.

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,880
-Hello?
-Hello?

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,800
Ganimard?

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,960
Listen. Monday, 10:00 a.m.
Café Paul, Place Dauphine.

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,280
Be there. You got it?

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,960
-I got it.
-And come alone.

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,920
-OK.
-Alone, Ganimard.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,040
I'll find out if you talk.

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,240
-Bet you will.
-By the way…

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
-Try cold water.
-Cold water?

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
The stain. It'll come out with cold water.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
Here we go. Bets are open. Come on!

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,440
Where's the ball?

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,960
You can see the ball.

54
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,520
We're taking bets.
Doubling, tripling them.

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
-Where is it?
-Left.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
There.

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,360
-Sure?
-Positive.

58
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,960
You win, sir.

59
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,320
-Thanks.
-We should've bet.

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,840
Round two. Come on, sir. The ball's here.

61
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,600
Come on. We're taking bets.

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,760
-Here?
-Yeah.

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,760
-Sure?
-Sure.

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,320
You've lost, sir.

65
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,400
-Too bad.
-Next time.

66
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,280
Can you see the ball?

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
Round three.

68
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,480
-So, how much?
-950.

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,040
-We did good work today.
-Yeah.

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,000
-Pretty girls.
-We're not so bad ourselves.

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
-Sorry.
-Assane?

72
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,280
How are you?

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,200
Good.

74
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,640
-Juliette, you coming?
-Coming.

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,160
-What are you doing here?
-I was just thinking about you.

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,720
What's the holdup?

77
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,400
Meet me here tomorrow?

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
Yeah. Totally.

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,280
See you tomorrow, then.

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
See you.

81
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
OK.

82
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,840
You don't waste any time.

83
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
A complicated story.

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,160
-I'll explain later.
-Who's that girl? You know her?

85
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,160
What are you doing here?

86
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Stop pretending.

87
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,520
Pretending what?

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,640
You expect me to believe
this is all a coincidence?

89
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,440
What's the catch this time?

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,600
The waiter is your father's security?

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,880
Sir?

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,120
May I take your coat?

93
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm not staying.

94
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
Very well.

95
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,880
Security agents aren't
what they used to be.

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm serious, Juliette.

97
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,760
This is going too far.

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,400
What is this about?

99
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,480
-Sure.
-Listen…

100
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,320
It's never been simple
between our families.

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,960
But we're not our fathers.

102
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,480
That was between them. Not us.

103
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,120
It's poisoning our relationship.

104
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,600
There's no catch.

105
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,360
You don't look well.
I'm trying to take your mind off things.

106
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,480
Don't feel like you have to stay.

107
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,560
That said, the food here is good.

108
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Madam?

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,440
-Would you like to order?
-Salmon, please.

110
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Sir?

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,360
-I'll have the same.
-Very well.

112
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,480
-Yes?
-Your appointment is here, sir.

113
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,600
Philippe Courbet.

114
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,200
-Hello, Philippe.
-Sir.

115
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,720
Come in.

116
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,720
-Whiskey?
-No, thank you.

117
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,560
Some wine, perhaps?

118
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,200
Not what I'm here for.
Let's get straight to it.

119
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,680
Have a seat.

120
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,720
So…

121
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,080
Tell me.

122
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,960
Very well.

123
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,320
I've checked the financial situation
of those attending the foundation's gala.

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Assuming that
30% of the attendees won't donate…

125
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,120
Presuming that donors are less generous
than they say,

126
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,280
we can expect 10 million euros.

127
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,120
As you requested,
15% will go to the foundation.

128
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
-The remaining 85%--
-Will go directly to me.

129
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,000
The money will be transferred
to an offshore account.

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
I just need a few days with my team
to finalize the contracts.

131
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,720
How old are you?

132
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,360
How old are you?

133
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,560
My age is of no importance, sir.

134
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,920
All that matters is
that I charge 10,000 euros an hour.

135
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,440
It's expensive,

136
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,840
but my clients get their money's worth.

137
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,280
They say you're the best.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
So they say.

139
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,640
-I have one question.
-Tell me.

140
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,920
Is your daughter a part of this scam?

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,480
-Let's not use that word.
-Yes, of course.

142
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Is Juliette Pellegrini involved
in all this?

143
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,040
No, she isn't.

144
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,360
Do you often dine alone?

145
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,200
No, I was stood up.

146
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,200
Was it a date?

147
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,880
I was supposed to meet

148
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,920
a Canadian donor for the foundation.

149
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,000
And, well, he canceled.

150
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Rich people love being philanthropists.

151
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,000
When it's about signing a check,
no one shows up.

152
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
Do you donate?

153
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,240
A lot more than you think, yes.

154
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Don't worry, I've got plenty left.

155
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,760
-Too much, in fact.
-Stop it.

156
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,560
Money can't buy happiness. Is that it?

157
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,760
No,
but let's say my life has become serious.

158
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,400
And…

159
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
there's no adrenaline left.

160
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,520
-Do you miss it?
-Yes.

161
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,160
Look at us now.

162
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,680
Hiding behind our wine glasses.

163
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,200
We'd never come to a place like this.

164
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,800
We would have.

165
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,920
We'd have left without paying.

166
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,360
-Should we?
-You're crazy.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,560
You can't improvise that.

168
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
-See? That's what I mean.
-What?

169
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,000
-You've become reasonable.
-Not at all.

170
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
I've changed methods.

171
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,040
And?

172
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,560
Is the table under your name?

173
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
It's in Velmont's name.

174
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Who?

175
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,200
Horace Velmont.
The Canadian who stood me up.

176
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
In that case…

177
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,520
Thanks for dinner, Horace Velmont.

178
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,280
-The check, please.
-All right.

179
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,160
Come on!

180
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,800
-Here.
-Thanks.

181
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,880
Hey! Your scooter!

182
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,720
Hey!

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Shit! My scooter!

184
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,080
The Pont Neuf, the quays along the Seine,

185
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,080
you didn't do that on purpose?

186
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,920
-I don't know what you mean.
-Yeah…

187
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,440
Anyway, I loved tonight. Thank you.

188
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,360
Me too.

189
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,160
-Too bad we can't stop time.
-Yeah, too bad.

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Good evening, madam.

191
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,480
Good evening, sir.

192
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,080
Come on…

193
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,400
Can't believe it.

194
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,760
Come on.

195
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,960
Ben, you there?

196
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,680
Claire, what are you doing here?

197
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,680
Well, I was in the neighborhood.

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,640
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

199
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,040
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

200
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,320
Have you heard from Assane? Is he OK?

201
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,840
Yes, don't worry.

202
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,080
-You sure?
-He's fine.

203
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
-Claire?
-Who is that?

204
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,880
He's a friend.

205
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,160
A friend?

206
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,440
-Shall I introduce you?
-Yes.

207
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,880
Marc?

208
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,280
So, this is Benjamin.

209
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,640
-Hello.
-Hello.

210
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,200
A beautiful store.

211
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,600
You don't have to be nice.
Assane's friend. He won't like you.

212
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,960
We're dating, so I can't like his store?

213
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,880
Indeed.

214
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,000
And how's Raoul?

215
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,640
He's great. Thank you.

216
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,560
Cool.

217
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,200
-Well, we'll get going.
-I'll see you out.

218
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,360
Bye, Ben. See you.

219
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,080
Excuse me?

220
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,920
I'd like to give Claire a present.
I saw a bracelet.

221
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,240
-That one, there?
-Yeah.

222
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
-Could you hold it for me?
-Sure.

223
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,280
-I'll come back for it.
-Yeah.

224
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,480
That's nice of you.

225
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,680
Before it was a museum,
Orsay was a train station.

226
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,760
The building sheltered prisoners
during the Liberation.

227
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,040
I'd like you to tell that story
to the children.

228
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,320
Of course.

229
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,840
Yes, it'd be wonderful
if they had access to the auditorium.

230
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,280
We could also organize screenings,
concerts, debates.

231
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,120
My assistant can send some suggestions--

232
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,640
Alice, I'm sorry.

233
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
-Please excuse me.
-No worries.

234
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,680
-Let's meet up outside.
-Great.

235
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,560
What are you doing here? I'm working.

236
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,080
I was passing by, and I saw you.

237
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
-You don't believe me?
-I know you.

238
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,920
Assane…

239
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,360
Last night was nice.

240
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,760
Today could be nice too.

241
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,680
Listen. I loved that night…

242
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,200
We're not 20 anymore.

243
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,480
Like you said yourself,

244
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,560
we can't stop time.

245
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,760
I have to go.

247
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,560
-You all right?
-Yes.

248
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,760
What are you doing?

249
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm working.

250
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,200
How's that going?

251
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,640
-What's up?
-I have something for you.

252
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,040
Really?

253
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
A small gift.

254
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,680
-Go on. Open it.
-Thank you.

255
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,440
I bought it in Ben's store.

256
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,280
He recommended it.
Don't like it? Blame him.

257
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,080
You kidding? It's gorgeous.

258
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,720
I love it.

259
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,240
Thank you.

260
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,800
I'm going to take a picture.
I'll send it to Ben.

261
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,840
-Courbet, have you met my daughter?
-I haven't had the pleasure.

262
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,920
Juliette!

263
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,080
You haven't met Philippe Courbet.

264
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,320
-No. Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

265
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
He's building the framework
to receive the donations.

266
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,720
Wonderful. Thank you.

267
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,200
Compared to everything you do,
it's not much.

268
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,760
-See you.
-See you.

269
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,680
All right.

270
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,680
There's a package for you.
I put it on your desk.

271
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,080
ATTENTION: JULIETTE PELLEGRINI

272
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,920
PISSARRO STOLEN FROM MUSÉE D'ORSAY

273
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,160
We're all devastated
by what's happened, of course.

274
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,520
The great sadness I'm feeling
extends far beyond

275
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,280
enthusiasts of art and culture.

276
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,040
All of France was wounded today.

277
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,800
SOMETIMES, YOU CAN STOP TIME. A.

278
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,200
Yes?

279
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,640
Two gentlemen are waiting for you.

280
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,920
Yes, I'm coming.

281
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,480
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Hello, madam.

282
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,400
Some questions for you.

283
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,320
-Yes?
-Were you at Musée d'Orsay yesterday?

284
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Yes. Why?

285
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,560
A painting was stolen at the same time.

286
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,120
Did you see anything
unusual or suspicious?

287
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,440
-No.
-Are you sure?

288
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,400
I believe you received a package today.

289
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,480
No, I…

290
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
I'm sorry. I assure you…

291
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,680
Don't worry.

292
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,920
No one's accusing you.

293
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,640
That's good.

294
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,480
Well, I'm at your disposal.

295
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,280
-If you need anything, don't hesitate.
-Thanks.

296
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,320
Have a good day.

297
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,920
I'll show you out.

298
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,120
Assane!

299
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,760
Are you crazy?

300
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
You can't steal a painting
and send it to me.

301
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,360
You don't like it?

302
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,240
I'm serious. The cops came to question me.

303
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,640
You said we couldn't stop time.
We can.

304
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,400
That painting is proof.

305
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,360
What are you doing?

306
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,560
Dinner,
the ride on the scooter, the painting…

307
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
What do you want?

308
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,960
You.

309
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,240
You made your choice a long time ago.

310
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Exactly.

311
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,080
Not the right one.

312
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,000
Claire is the mother of my son,

313
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,840
but nothing more.

314
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,320
-I was wrong about her.
-Stop it, Assane.

315
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,960
Deep down, you're like me.

316
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,640
-You have feelings you won't admit to.
-Really?

317
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,440
Look around. No cops.

318
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,200
You didn't rat me out.

319
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,120
We're here together.

320
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,920
Because we want to be.

321
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,880
It might not be too late.

322
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,400
Prove it to me.

323
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,720
What?

324
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,080
Prove it to me.

325
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Not by stealing a master painting.

326
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
How?

327
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,640
Claire.

328
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,080
She's pretty. Pretty eyes, pretty smile.

329
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,920
-Not living the dream--
-You don't know her.

330
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
I know more than you think.

331
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,680
You can find out
everything on social media.

332
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,280
-You do that?
-Sometimes.

333
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,440
I noticed a few interesting things.

334
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
She has a boyfriend.

335
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,040
Not bad looking.

336
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,120
He gave her a bracelet.

337
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,440
And she clearly loves it.

338
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
I love it too.

339
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,760
And?

340
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,320
You stole from the Musée d'Orsay.

341
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,600
You can steal a bracelet from your ex.

342
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,400
You can do it.

343
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,640
A rare model.

344
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,400
Can you track it down?

345
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,960
The bracelet was in my possession
for a bit…

346
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,360
-I sold it.
-To whom?

347
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,520
-I could buy it back.
-No.

348
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,120
No.

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,840
OK.

350
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,240
-You sold it to Claire.
-Yes.

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,520
-Not exactly.
-What do you mean? Did you or did you not?

352
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,480
The guy she was with bought it from me.
Marc.

353
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,720
-I didn't like him.
-Really?

354
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,160
-No.
-And why not?

355
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,840
-OK. He was very nice.
-There you go.

356
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,400
This bracelet is a rare piece.
You won't find another one like it.

357
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,560
So if Juliette wants it,
you'll have to steal it.

358
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,000
From Claire.

359
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,320
-Where are you going with that makeup?
-Nowhere.

360
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,920
I ran into Céleste's mother.

361
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,640
You were chatting
with a young Black man yesterday.

362
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,120
You seemed to know him very well.

363
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,400
I said you didn't know any Black boys.
Though I have a pretty good idea.

364
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,240
I forbid you to see him.

365
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,920
-Who said I was--
-Juliette.

366
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,760
We've nothing in common
with those people.

367
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,080
Understand?

368
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,440
ARSÈNE LUPIN VERSUS HERLOCK SHOLMÈS

369
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,760
Here, as promised.

370
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,480
Not bad.

371
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,280
So? What do we do now?

372
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,640
I'd like for us to start over.

373
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,160
No more lies.

374
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,120
You're right. I'm a reasonable guy.

375
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,000
I'll return the painting.

376
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,120
And Claire's bracelet.

377
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
We've never been allowed to be together.

378
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,400
-Really?
-You know that.

379
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,120
I don't anymore.

380
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,600
Your father.

381
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,520
-He's always been against us.
-Stop obsessing over him.

382
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,720
-What do you want?
-To live our story.

383
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,480
You want me to choose
between you and my father?

384
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,640
I didn't say that.

385
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,320
He framed my father 25 years ago.

386
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,600
-What?
-You don't know the whole story.

387
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,080
Go see your mother. She knows.

388
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,640
My mother has nothing to do with him.

389
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,520
Exactly. Go see her.

390
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,240
She'll tell you the truth.

391
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,040
Once you've heard the truth,
you'll do what's necessary.

392
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,320
-Here.
-What's this?

393
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,840
The name of a cop.

394
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,800
Ganimard.

395
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,040
A trustworthy guy.

396
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,320
Your mom can talk to him.

397
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,120
We missed our chance when we were young.

398
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,360
Now we know what we want.

399
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,120
Here.

400
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You know where to find me. Remember?

401
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,800
Here, you have
Pissarro's The Seine and the Louvre.

402
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,480
Right behind,
Toulouse-Lautrec's masterpiece.

403
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,040
PISSARRO'S PAINTING RETURNED
TO THE MUSÉE D'ORSAY

404
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,720
A WEEK EARLIER

405
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,600
So, what's the plan now?

406
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,640
Assane?

407
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,120
Don't worry.

408
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,320
Pellegrini went after my son.
I'll do the same.

409
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,560
Aiming for the daughter.

410
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,200
We've got work to do.

411
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,760
Hi, I'd like to book a table
for two tomorrow evening.

412
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,520
A table near the window.

413
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,760
Perfect.

414
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Of course. My name's Horace Velmont.
V-E-L-M-O-N-T.

415
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,120
Thank you, sir. Bye.

416
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,280
Great. You'll call Juliette
and pretend to be this Velmont.

417
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,520
I'll tell her the foundation's amazing.

418
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,280
That I want to make a donation
and meet her.

419
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,600
I'm flying back to Montreal,
so I'll offer to meet that very evening.

420
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,560
Exactly.

421
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
Yes, that would be wonderful.

422
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
We could have dinner together.

423
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,520
The rest has to come from her.
That's the key.

424
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,840
Come inside.

425
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,400
I'll cover my tracks.

426
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,080
She'll never imagine…

427
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,640
The food here is good.

428
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,360
Is the table under your name?

429
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,400
…she was manipulated.

430
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
In Velmont's name.

431
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,400
-Who?
-Horace Velmont.

432
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,000
In that case, thanks for dinner,
Horace Velmont.

433
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,920
Come on!

434
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,760
We'll pay the waiter
so he won't come after us.

435
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,280
Pay the bill upfront.

436
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,480
Hey! Your scooter!

437
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,360
And compensate the delivery guy.

438
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,120
Then…

439
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,760
Magic happens.

440
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,880
She has to believe
I'd do anything for her.

441
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,960
She'd do anything for me.

442
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,080
Even betray her father.

443
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm following so far.

444
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,840
-How are we going to steal the painting?
-We won't.

445
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,680
We'll make her think it was stolen.

446
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,600
Watch this video
about the Notre-Dame fire.

447
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,480
You change the banner.

448
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,120
There you go.

449
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,920
We're all devastated
by what's happened, of course.

450
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,360
The great sadness I'm feeling
extends far beyond

451
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,720
enthusiasts of art and culture.

452
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,160
All of France was wounded today.

453
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,040
I'll send her fake notifications.

454
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,160
I have guys to play along.

455
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,840
What do you want with Étienne?

456
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,320
Don't worry. No one is accusing you.

457
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,800
That's good.

458
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,960
We need a forged painting.

459
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,920
I'm counting on you.

460
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,280
It shouldn't be a problem.

461
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,160
So, really…

462
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,360
we're not the ones trapping Pellegrini.

463
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,920
His daughter is.

464
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,320
What's going on, dear?

465
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,160
Assane Diop told me to come see you.

466
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,400
I've been kept in the dark for too long.

467
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,440
I need to know.

468
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,960
Your father needed money.

469
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,560
He found the perfect scapegoat.

470
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,720
Diop's confession didn't earn him
a reduced sentence.

471
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Your father lied.

472
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,760
Why didn't you say anything?
Or report him?

473
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,760
Why?
Because he was the father of my daughter.

474
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,480
You loved him so much.

475
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,840
I didn't want trouble
or to deprive you of him.

476
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,360
Mom…

477
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,280
This needs to stop.
You have to tell the truth about Dad.

478
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,320
Talk to the police.

479
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,240
I don't know.

480
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,560
Here. Go see this person.

481
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,400
Tell him what you know.

482
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,360
It's the only thing to do.

483
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,360
OK. All this for a coffee date.

484
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,680
Yeah.

485
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,800
All this for a coffee date.

486
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
Are you Ganimard?

487
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,800
Yes.

488
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,800
I'm here for my daughter.
I promised her the truth about her father.

489
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,560
Great, but who are you?

490
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,240
Anne Pellegrini.

491
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,440
If you could sign just here.

492
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,440
And here.

493
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,080
Congratulations.

494
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,280
Sir…

495
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,240
What is it?

496
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,840
Police, Mr. Pellegrini.

497
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,160
We have a search warrant.

498
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,520
You're under arrest on suspicion
of fraud, obstruction of justice.

499
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,160
We'll be questioning you
about Babakar Diop.

500
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,320
You're kidding?

501
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,240
Come on.

502
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,040
My cane!

503
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,880
LIVE - HUBERT PELLEGRINI UNDER ARREST

504
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,440
ARRESTED FOR FRAUD,
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

505
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,080
-Where are you?
-I'll be a bit late.

506
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,760
What are you doing?
Pellegrini's been arrested. It's official!

507
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,440
I have to go see Juliette.

508
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,960
No. Don't make that mistake.

509
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,720
It's over, Assane. It's done.

510
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I won't be long. See you in a bit.

511
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Good evening, sir.

512
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,320
Good evening, madam.
