2
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,771
You almost lost me back there.

3
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,025
- So, what is this place?
- Someplace special.

4
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,028
I found this on a family camping trip
when I was a kid.

5
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,908
Go on in.

6
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,119
Are you serious?

7
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,789
It's warm.

8
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,959
Of course.
They're hot springs, you goof.

9
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,133
Whoo! It's hot!

10
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,109
Ooh...

11
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,868
Is this enough?

12
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,455
Well, if you really wanna
go back to nature...

13
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,698
- It's nice and hot.
- Promise we'll do this every year.

14
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,284
Until we wrinkle.

15
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,602
Whoo!

16
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,593
Nick?

17
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,890
Sweetie, are you hurt?

18
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,561
Daria! Ah!

19
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,563
Over here! Ah!

20
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,108
Nick!

21
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,819
Are you OK?

22
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,030
- Did you fall?
- No. Someone fucking shot me.

23
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,116
What?

24
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,513
Ahh!

25
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,676
So you had no idea?

26
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,970
He's adopted, you know that.

27
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,433
Thanks, Toni, having only known him
since freshman year.

28
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,186
Still kind of cool, though, right?

29
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,606
Finding out you actually
had some family out there.

30
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:18,193
We are his family.
That's why we're all here.

31
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,155
And that's why my brother and those guys
are right behind us.

32
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,783
Look, I don't know what to expect.

33
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,494
I don't know these people
or this place.

34
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,412
I could be inheriting a Motel 6.

35
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,624
Or... a meth empire.

36
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,670
I'm just saying,
it's the Appalachians.

37
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,380
Thanks, Vic.

38
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,049
If it'll help,
I did some digging.

39
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,553
- This isn't for one of your columns.
- Of course not.

40
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,013
I'm just the investigative type.

41
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:52,561
Hobb Springs, established 1926
by families unknown.

42
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,729
Maybe yours.

43
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,108
The first sanitarium in America
outside Battle Creek.

44
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,152
Well, most people would approve.

45
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,323
- Of what?
- Me going into a sanitarium.

46
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,956
Agnes Fields.

47
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,669
- You are gonna get yours.
- I'll hold you to that, Mr. Jackson.

48
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,054
It's more like a health spa, really.

49
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,389
Spas don't come
with their own outhouse, Bryan.

50
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,600
Jillian, it's two weeks, OK?

51
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,936
You know, getting Danny
out in the open air,

52
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,605
seeing how much of an inheritance
this really is.

53
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,776
Really, Rod? Me fixing a tire
is so amazing?

54
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,903
- Just playing with my new camera.
- Yeah.

55
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,951
And your old camera posted my naked ass
all over the internet last trip!

56
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,370
And got 4,000 hits in one day.

57
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,497
Besides, come on, it's fun.

58
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,124
And fun is just the kind of therapy
we all need.

59
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,294
- Especially my sister and Danny.
- Yeah.

60
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,254
Gotta love therapy.

61
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,178
Wanna start the healing process?

62
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,816
Sally?

63
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,277
You've checked yourself
six times this morning.

64
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,116
- He'll be here real soon.
- I know.

65
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,742
It may take some time.

66
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,414
I can't go another winter.

67
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,211
I need this.

68
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,215
We need this.

69
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,427
We play this right,

70
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,347
sister, he won't
be able to resist you.

71
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,816
Lord knows I can't.

72
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,199
You guys, it's gigantic.

73
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,453
- You inherited this?
- I guess so.

74
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,955
Our little place in the country.

75
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,210
Well, it ain't a Motel 6.

76
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,337
Couple coats of paint,
and it could be...

77
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,381
Fucking brilliant.

78
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,517
Creepy.

79
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,312
Vic, get out of the car.

80
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,106
I need a moment alone with my boyfriend.

81
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,860
Fine.

82
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,164
It's time to decide.

83
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,833
What do you want to do?

84
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,590
Just when I hit
the lowest I've ever hit,

85
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,094
I got a letter saying
that I belonged to something.

86
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,555
Something that
I gave up on years ago.

87
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,808
Tell me what you wanna do, honey.

88
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,436
I wanna meet these people
and find out what I'm all about.

89
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,818
Oh, my God.

90
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,737
- Yeah.
- Wow.

91
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,490
- It's huge.
- I know, right?

92
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,909
Welcome to Hobb Springs.

93
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,829
- Danny.
- That's right, yeah.

94
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,082
I could tell by your eyes.

95
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:28,253
I cannot believe that you
are finally here.

96
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,965
- And who are you?
- This would be Sally.

97
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,967
I'm Jackson.
We're the caretakers here.

98
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,594
We weren't expecting your friends,
but, um...

99
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,513
...I'm pretty sure we can
handle you, though.

100
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,015
Oh, we're just the first wave.

101
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,065
This is huge!

102
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,151
How are we even gonna
find our way around in there?

103
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,069
They call this a spa?

104
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,238
Better leave a trail of breadcrumbs.

105
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,447
We got a flat,

106
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,408
- and then got a little...
- Baked.

107
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,201
Turned around.

108
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:04,289
I see, no problem.
We have plenty of vacancies coming up.

109
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,958
Don't worry, they'll be checking
out today and then we'll have the place

110
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,044
- all to ourselves.
- Oh, goody.

111
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,880
I'd be happy to show you around.

112
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,715
Uh, maybe we could get our bags first.

113
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,760
Yeah, maybe some rooms.
It's been a long drive.

114
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,221
Whatever you wish.
We work for you now.

115
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,348
That's pretty cool, actually.

116
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,729
- Danny has servants now?
- Hey, how you doing?

117
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,067
Ya'll come on in.

118
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,740
Thank you.

119
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,617
Geez.

120
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,125
They're kind of good-looking
for hillbillies.

121
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,294
They're cousins.
No, brother and sister.

122
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,962
Same thing around these parts.

123
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,797
Come on, they're probably just
a normal couple.

124
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,634
- They're funny-looking.
- And Amish.

125
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,889
Actually, we're kissing cousins
on our Quaker brother's sister's side.

126
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,808
I'm so sorry, that was so rude of us.

127
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:10,563
Ain't nothing we haven't heard before.
Just let it roll off my back nowadays.

128
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,066
So you really are brother and sister?

129
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,502
As I said, we weren't expecting so many.

130
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,128
We can make more, if you'd like.

131
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,839
Uh, no, no, it's fine. Really.

132
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,050
We'll leave you hereto rest a spell
while we figure out

133
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,219
how best to deal with you.

134
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,808
What is that?

135
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,228
Go on, sit down.

136
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:55,358
- We're really staying here?
- Why, what's wrong?

137
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:01,155
Ain't no doubt all of this
is a little bit weird.

138
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,449
- Yeah.
- You guys don't get

139
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,993
the charm of this place?

140
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,161
I do.

141
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,081
You rip the place down,
subdivide the land,

142
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,250
and we go back, we'll send someone in
for a real appraisal.

143
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,254
Yeah, I think you're forgetting
that I don't have anywhere to go.

144
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,549
What,
so this is your home now?

145
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,259
I don't know. Maybe.

146
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,553
Danny, you're used
to Central Park West

147
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,599
- and Nobu on Friday nights.
- Yeah. And look what that did to me.

148
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,102
Hey, we don't have to make
a decision right away. It's fine.

149
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,773
This place is alive.
It has history, secrets.

150
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,651
Enough excitement for two weeks
at least.

151
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,571
- Come on, back me up, Vic.
- Uh, sure.

152
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,656
A place this old surely
has a book in it.

153
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,617
- Maybe a movie even.
- Short of murder,

154
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,995
or a Hollywood scandal,
who'd give a shit?

155
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,291
Me, Bryan. We could be talking
about my history.

156
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,960
- So me.
- Yeah, me too.

157
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,672
- Me.
- Gotta stick by family.

158
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,525
Is that the big, strong man
I rang for?

159
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,278
That's more like it.

160
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,823
Hello?

161
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,075
Mr. Jackson?

162
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,286
Hello?! Oh...

163
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,981
Shhh...

164
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,991
Silly little bitty.

165
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:54,036
A little self control, boys!
That's all I ask!

166
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,462
Oh, my God!
Is that real gold?

167
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:11,345
Oh, Bryan! These are Hepplewhite!

168
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,764
<i>And tor those that don't watch
Antique Roadshow...</i>

169
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,309
Oh, and they look to be
in perfect condition.

170
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,520
- Oh, they're gonna be worth a fortune.
- A fortune?

171
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,564
How'd you like my place now, Bryan?

172
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:29,030
Hey, guys.
This place just got a whole lot better.

173
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,616
- What?
- Oh, great.

174
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,826
Where's he going now?

175
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,956
Let's get naked.

176
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,794
Whoo!

177
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,970
It actually smells sweet.

178
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,974
Hey, guys, if we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do this in style.

179
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,271
- You ready for it?
- No!

180
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,904
- Thanks, man.
- Come on in!

181
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,698
There's room for everybody!

182
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:21,541
- Hey. You OK?
- It's really all mine.

183
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,585
I'm still wrapping
my head around that.

184
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,879
Maybe it's just what we needed.

185
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,068
I suppose this will have to do.

186
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,861
Afraid this is all we have right now.

187
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,159
Hello? We're the new owner's
best friends. So you can do better.

188
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,239
Are we all here?

189
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,495
Now, you boys had your fun
with those bikers.

190
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,331
And you messed
with the little bitty real nice.

191
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,834
Now quit!

192
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,256
Leave Danny alone. Even if it means
giving his friends a pass.

193
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,133
Now I thought I made myself clear!

194
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:49,980
it won't be long, and you can all
have at 'em as much as you like.

195
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,734
Now you keep doing what you're doing
you're gonna ruin this for all of us!

196
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,154
Do I make myself clear?
Do you understand me?

197
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,167
Fucking family.

198
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,236
So, like, what's the plan
with the cameras, dude?

199
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,488
Like, you're carrying them
around everywhere.

200
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,909
Yeah, man. Look.
Compact and easy to hide.

201
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,704
I think we should put one of these
in Danny's room.

202
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,665
Oh, I'm not up for seeing my sister
naked, but thank you, though.

203
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,792
Well, what about the rest of us, dude?

204
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,335
Fucking asshole!

205
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,953
Danny.

206
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,092
Oh, shit.

207
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,680
What are you doing?

208
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,808
Please tell me you got a camera for this.

209
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,559
Give it here, give it here.

210
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,982
I'd like to thank the Academy
for this prestigious award.

211
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,528
I will enjoy this every single day.

212
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,701
Tell me how it's fair that we
have to pay for groceries.

213
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,540
Aw...

214
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,542
Poor puppy!

215
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,419
- Bryan.
- Yeah?

216
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,255
Come check this out.

217
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,265
You folks just passing through?

218
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,351
No, we're staying
up at Hobb Springs.

219
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,894
You don't say.

220
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,608
I don't get up there much myself
anymore, but I expect I will be.

221
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,069
- Well, why is that?
- You just got in?

222
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,320
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

223
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,323
You all see a bunch of little, old
ladies be-bopping around up there?

224
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,409
Oh, yeah.
The Daughters of the Revolution?

225
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,495
That'd be them. Poor things can't
remember if this woman got back

226
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,205
on that bus or not.

227
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,748
Agnes Fields, you hear of her?

228
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,043
No. Like I said,
we just got here, so...

229
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,089
Just what is a lovely couple like you
doing settling in Hobb Springs?

230
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,842
Oh, well, our friend inherited it.

231
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,011
Well, nice for him, huh?

232
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,262
Tell you what.

233
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,973
You take one of these up there,
do me a favor, show it around.

234
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,018
Maybe we get lucky and her face
will ring a bell with somebody.

235
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,395
Oh, is there a reward?

236
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,732
Sure thing, officer.

237
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,942
I can't think what could
have happened to her.

238
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,739
- OK. Well, take care.
- See ya.

239
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,998
What are you doing?

240
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,585
I can't get this hot spot to work.

241
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,172
Have you guys seen Danny?

242
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,215
Yeah, he just wandered
through here a minute ago.

243
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,426
Leave him alone, Mom,
he's enjoying himself.

244
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,387
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

245
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,891
- Come on. Let's go find him.
- Thank you.

246
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,644
I guess this place
just gives me the creeps.

247
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,282
Danny. We've been looking
all over for you.

248
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,868
You OK?

249
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,287
Take a look at this picture
and tell me if I should be.

250
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:21,168
That guy kind of looks like Danny.

251
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,253
Even some of the women do.

252
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,798
The whole history
of this hotel's up here.

253
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,427
How could I not know
any of these people?

254
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,805
These pictures only go up to the '70s.

255
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,516
Maybe your side of the family moved.

256
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,143
Not everybody, though. Look.

257
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,646
I think we just met your cousins.

258
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,359
Whoa, you GUYS-

259
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,947
Why the hell
are they all covered up?

260
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,783
I don't know how to break this
to you, man,

261
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,663
but what we have here
is classic mountain breeding.

262
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,832
- Stop.
- I'm just saying, there's bound

263
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,209
to be a few defects along the way.

264
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,670
- Stop. Seriously.
- You heard him!

265
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,842
You think 'cause we're mountain folk,
our ways ain't fit for fine society?

266
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,678
We've had all sorts stay here,
including three presidents:

267
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,847
Teddy Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge,
and Jefferson Davis.

268
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,057
Not one had a complaint!

269
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,060
- Jefferson Davis?
- It's OK, Jackson. Really.

270
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,939
He was just messing around.
Weren't you, Vic?

271
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:28,986
I'm sorry.
I'm just very proud of my heritage.

272
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,989
Families really tamed this land,
they made it into something.

273
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,241
It's impressive. Really.

274
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,702
Yeah.

275
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,621
Wanna see something really impressive?

276
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,457
- Yeah.
- Come on.

277
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,804
Shit!

278
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,474
- Don't touch.
- Sorry.

279
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,530
You have a good eye, Danny.
It belonged to your grandfather.

280
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,576
- He was hell with a bow.
- The bane of critters everywhere.

281
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,373
- What is it, honey?
- My grandfather.

282
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,836
My grandfather.
I just can't believe I...

283
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,297
...even had a grand...

284
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,966
Please. Give it a feel.

285
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,021
Man, that's tight.

286
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,565
Ever been bow hunting, Danny?

287
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,400
Never been hunting, period.

288
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,195
I would like to keep it that way.

289
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,072
That's hardly a proper view, miss,

290
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,740
considering you haven't
even tried it once.

291
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,953
Don't.

292
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,754
- Fit OK?
- I'm getting used to it.

293
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,339
I knew you would.

294
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:16,009
Your girl, she really
didn't want you to come.

295
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,221
She's just being protective.
They all are.

296
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,598
That guy with the fancy car
and girl to match.

297
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,351
Bryan? We used to work together,

298
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,812
before it all... happened.

299
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,151
I used to be on Wall Street.
Had a bit of a meltdown.

300
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,155
- Seems an appropriate reaction.
-  Not everybody thought so.

301
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,158
Not my company.

302
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,577
Definitely not my clients.

303
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,954
I lost a lot of people's money.

304
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:48,792
Including Bryan's, Toni's, my own.

305
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,752
I guess that's when you find out
who your real friends are.

306
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,048
- The ones who stand by you.
- Maybe they think you owe them.

307
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,843
No, not them.

308
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,761
It was all so embarrassing.

309
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,723
You weren't suited to that nonsense.

310
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,100
On the plus side, it's how we found you.

311
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,894
What do you mean?

312
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,272
We do have
the internet out here.

313
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,566
- So you found me through Google?
- Yeah.

314
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,445
Took a long time.
But it was important we found you.

315
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:20,240
- To run a hotel?
- Amongst other things.

316
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,924
Time to climb up.

317
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,800
This doesn't belong to somebody?

318
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,428
Anything on this land
belongs to us.

319
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,015
Go on.

320
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,900
Beer has arrived.

321
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,789
- There you go, dude.
- Fuck, we need an opener.

322
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,541
- Yeah.
- Hey! Where's Danny?

323
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,794
Out hunting.

324
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,922
- What, Danny?
- What's this?

325
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,634
Oh, yeah. Remember the little gaggle
of old ladies?

326
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,095
- Yeah.
- Well, one of them went AWOL.

327
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,056
Fucking Alzheimer's, dude.
It's a fucking killer.

328
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,772
- You need to go get Danny.
- Now?

329
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,565
Yes. Please.

330
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,361
It's gonna get dark soon, and I don't
like him alone with these people.

331
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,613
OK, Mom.

332
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,865
They ain't gonna like it.

333
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,081
- Are you sure we don't...
- Sh!

334
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,958
...need a permit or anything?

335
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,713
Every man lives by his own set of rules.

336
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,301
Speaking of which,
time to introduce you to the hunt.

337
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,989
First you gotta scout, then stretch.

338
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,286
<i>Someplace the deer feels safe.</i>

339
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,003
<i>Where men can't get to it.</i>

340
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,214
Bait your area.

341
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,095
<i>Lure, entice the deer over your ways.</i>

342
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,518
<i>You don't wanna
go after your prey.</i>

343
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,774
<i>You let your prey come to you.</i>

344
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,528
<i>It's about patience.</i>

345
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,452
<i>And being smarter than the animal.</i>

346
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,298
<i>Be still.</i>

347
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,093
Aim for the upper shoulder.

348
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,056
The neck.

349
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,226
Or the brain.

350
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,689
A one-shot kill.

351
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,075
Now we check the blood trail.

352
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,587
Pink blood with air bubbles
means you've hit the heart or the lung.

353
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,131
<i>Now that's what you want.</i>

354
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,550
<i>Dark red, you probably hit the liver.</i>

355
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,052
<i>The buck may hang in there,
but they will die soon enough.</i>

356
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,228
<i>Watery blood with bile,
you may have to track the deer,</i>

357
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,563
<i>deliver another shot.</i>

358
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,660
<i>He may try to bolt.</i>

359
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,331
<i>But if you've aimed just right,
it'll be pure reflex.</i>

360
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,546
Good shot, Danny.

361
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,674
- What do we do next?
- Nothing.

362
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:51,470
It's dark red blood.
Besides, he'll be dead soon.

363
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,264
We have more than enough meat back home.
Come on.

364
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,057
We can't just leave it like this.

365
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,104
It's your kill.

366
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,940
Just be careful.

367
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,110
He may have some kick left in him.

368
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,531
Upper shoulder, neck or brain. Go.

369
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,692
Very good, Danny.

370
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,528
That's very good.

371
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,121
Charlie, what did you do to this weed?

372
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,126
Oh, fuck this!

373
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,194
Shit!

374
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,867
Jesus!

375
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,412
- You're bleeding.
- So are you.

376
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,539
Most of it's not mine anyway. Ah!

377
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,834
We've gotta get out of here!
He saw my face.

378
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,171
- Who? Are you tripping?
- Not anymore, I'm not.

379
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,216
- This is fucked up!
- Ahh!

380
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,849
- It's him.
- Relax. It's probably just Jackson.

381
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:49,522
Or not. Here, pull from that end.
Pull from that. Slow, slow, slow!

382
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,484
It's not coming!
It's too twisted!

383
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,486
- Go get some help!
- I can't leave you!

384
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,863
- Go!
- OK.

385
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,581
Ah!

386
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,708
Sorry if it stings, sweetie.

387
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,168
No, no, it's OK.

388
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,087
I'm blaming Vic for that too.

389
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,882
You have to be sure about these woods.

390
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,638
So I heard a buck,
your first time shooting.

391
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,640
It wasn't a buck.

392
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,603
- I killed a doe.
- Even better.

393
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,940
- Is that strong stuff?
- Yeah.

394
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,442
- It sure smells like it.
- Yeah.

395
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,697
- It takes some getting used to.
- No, no, it's... it's fine, actually.

396
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,241
I kinda like it.

397
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,828
I do make it myself.

398
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,875
You sit right there.

399
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,878
We'll be right back.
I'm gonna wash this off of my hands.

400
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,536
Now to get you out
of those bloody things.

401
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,917
All right, it's OK. I can do it.

402
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:37,547
Now, don't you be that way. I patched up
all my brothers one time or another.

403
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,511
OK. Fine.

404
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,267
All you boys react that way.

405
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,698
I'd say you're strong enough.

406
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,576
You just...

407
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:10,205
You just have some aches
that need rubbing out.

408
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,749
Toni will be here any second, so...

409
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,460
There's no sense waiting.

410
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,756
You're very important to us.

411
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,342
You don't even know me.

412
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,473
But I know this.

413
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,768
And it beats inside
every one of us.

414
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:36,648
And with your mind, your schooling,
your strength,

415
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,275
and our blood,

416
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,320
you can have anything you want.

417
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,742
- I still find it hard to believe that.
- Don't you?

418
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,580
What's, uh...

419
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,541
Where have you been?

420
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,419
Jackson brought Danny to me
to tend to.

421
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,505
I got pretty messed up, hon.

422
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,799
Yeah, Vic didn't look so good either.

423
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,969
I should go tend to him.

424
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,816
Think she's gonna help Vic
take off his clothes too?

425
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,318
Oh, come on, stop.
She was just trying to help.

426
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,780
Help herself, obviously.

427
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,283
You look gross.

428
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,329
Does it hurt? Oh!

429
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,583
- What is all over your legs?
- Oh, it's ointment.

430
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,127
It's a family formula.

431
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:43,256
God, you're gonna get infected.
You should lay down.

432
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,800
- Now you're talking.
- Ew! Don't touch me!

433
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,636
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- Don't! Don't touch me.

434
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,513
- You're disgusting. No.
- Please. Come here.

435
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,390
It's not... where's the peroxide?

436
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,893
I had a bad feeling about this.

437
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,270
You going-

438
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,688
Did you actually kill something?

439
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,149
Because it looks like you
rolled around in blood.

440
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,151
Yeah, with a bow and arrow.

441
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,863
- You actually...
- Yeah.

442
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,448
It's pretty cool, huh?

443
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,575
- No!
- Yeah, it is.

444
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,411
No, it's not. I'm not impressed.

445
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,538
- Come here.
- What are you, a hunter now?

446
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,832
Oh, yeah, big time. Big man.
Big man hunter.

447
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,381
We should pick up hunting.

448
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,783
- Why so glum, sugarplum?
- Get that thing out of my face.

449
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,202
Can I interest you
in an herbal essence?

450
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,912
Keep that shit away from me too.

451
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,581
You see one mountain monster man,
and you go cold turkey.

452
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,625
- I saw...
- What?

453
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,046
Nothing. Give that to me.

454
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,759
- You. Dude!
- Oh, shoot!

455
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:57,473
You know what I saw today?
Civil War era.

456
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,892
Flatware. Silver.

457
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,062
What are you doing?

458
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,943
Oh, you know.
Just feeling some love tonight.

459
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,823
Now. Go, go, chug!

460
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,366
There we go, there we go.

461
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,328
There it is! Yeah!

462
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,462
Give that.

463
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,633
- Hey, man.
- Ah!

464
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:37,930
- Nice.
- You see any mountain men now? Ahh!

465
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,103
No.

466
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,813
Better.

467
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,329
- Wait.
- What is it?

468
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,048
- Now I feel better.
- Damn it!

469
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,801
<i>Come on,</i> Jill!
<i>Give us the old Girls Gone Wild.</i>

470
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,471
Fuck you! I'd like to see you guys
do Boys Gone <i>Wild.</i>

471
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,765
What do you mean?

472
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,894
- Now it's a party!
- Get that away!

473
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,146
Sick. You're sick.

474
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,358
- Come on, guys.
- Sorry.

475
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,740
- Yeah!
- Nice!

476
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,159
Just a minute, guys.

477
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,370
Whoa!

478
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,881
You OK, man?

479
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,483
Wait a second. You're doing what?

480
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,402
Restoring Hobb Springs.
Top to bottom.

481
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,905
Figure we could have a grand reopening
by next summer.

482
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,449
What did you do to him last night?

483
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,118
- This isn't me.
- It was my decision.

484
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,412
There's something about this place.

485
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,165
Haven't you guys felt different
since you got here?

486
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:55,211
- Yeah. I've been freaking out.
- Passing out over here.

487
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:59,257
- Toni?
- No, we're really happy for you, hon.

488
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,760
- But this place...
- Was great. And it can be again.

489
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:07,348
Do you even know anything about...
about running a hotel, or a spa?

490
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:11,852
- I'm not just doing it for the money.
- No, we get that. We really do.

491
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,439
Rod? You said that we'd all
make a great web series.

492
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,277
What better way to film a group
of friends restoring a great landmark.

493
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,905
Yeah. I could definitely cut
a good sizzle reel together.

494
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:26,534
- Make it a rustic <i>Real</i> World.
- And Vic?

495
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,995
You said you were game for writing a
book about the history of this place.

496
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,163
- Sure, but...
- See, Bry?

497
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,832
We build awareness.

498
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,501
The rest of it is just
simple business sense

499
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,837
and that's why they
paid us the big bucks.

500
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,380
What do you say, man?

501
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,719
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt
to draw up a business plan.

502
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,512
I knew you'd come around.

503
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,267
I know what you're gonna say.

504
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:52,977
Then why are you gonna make me say it?

505
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:56,022
Did you look at the guy?
It's like night and day.

506
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,482
We were supposed to be going
back to the city.

507
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,777
It's not so easy for me
to just pack it all in, you know.

508
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:02,987
We came hereto help him.

509
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,323
I don't even know why
we're still friends with the guy!

510
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,451
Oh, my God!
You just don't know when to shut up!

511
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,997
What?

512
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,167
What exactly were you doing with that?

513
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,710
Jillian?

514
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,131
This is Staffordshire.

515
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,258
Do you have any idea
how much these are worth?

516
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,843
How much?

517
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,473
Two thousand, at least.

518
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,061
Cabinet's full of them. I...

519
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,439
I didn't think anyone would notice.

520
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:39,899
Show me.

521
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,528
Where else have you checked for these?

522
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,449
Just here. I didn't wanna look alone.

523
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,411
All right. I'll bring them to you,
and you catalogue them. OK?

524
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,373
Yes!

525
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,671
H9)'-

526
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,093
Oh, yeah.

527
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:13,599
These... are perfect.

528
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:48,008
So secret passages really do exist.

529
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,473
Yeah, but where do they lead?

530
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,072
Check out those cupboards.

531
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,873
Are we going down there?

532
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,834
They keep priceless antiques
out in the open.

533
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,587
Can you imagine what they
decided to hide?

534
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,211
- Hey. Are they...?
- Yep.

535
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,463
They're screwing.

536
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,763
What the hell is that?

537
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,308
I think I know.

538
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,273
Get the idea?

539
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,442
Wait.

540
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,403
You're saying that they would just
have sex here

541
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,490
- while people stood by and watched?
- Mm-hm.

542
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:39,286
Geez. This is one kinky spa.

543
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,582
Whoa, whoa!

544
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:47,294
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm agreeing with you.

545
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,630
Kinky, right?

546
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,765
Wait. Are we really gonna do this?

547
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,769
Yeah.

548
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,245
No!

549
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,693
Stop!

550
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,822
You were supposed to wait!

551
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,534
Now you disrespect this room?

552
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,788
Well, go on now!

553
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:31,083
You might as well
take what you came for.

554
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,461
He stays with me.

555
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:41,885
Get!

556
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,792
What those boys did to you...

557
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,684
You like that?

558
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,561
Your head's hurt real bad.

559
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,689
But I've seen people live
with a lot worse.

560
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:42,029
Just let Sally take care of you.

561
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,077
You're so handsome.

562
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:53,624
I think you like me
rubbing up against you.

563
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,000
No...

564
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,420
No...

565
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:14,686
I can make you feel better
than that stuck-up bitch you brought.

566
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,236
Sally!

567
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,449
You're supposed to be saving yourself
for when the time's right.

568
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,368
When's that gonna be?

569
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,161
I know it's hard to wait.

570
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,793
But I'm so close, that I can touch him.

571
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,003
How did this one get in here
to begin with?

572
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,299
I tried to stop 'em.

573
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,886
The fact they stopped at all
is a small miracle.

574
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,598
- They're just not listening.
- Tonight then.

575
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,017
We have them all meet Danny tonight.

576
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,271
You ready?

577
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,818
Finish him off.

578
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,028
Take him to the kitchen.

579
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,905
We'll carve him up later.

580
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,872
Don't you fret, lover.

581
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,749
You'll be in me, one way or another.

582
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,449
Water damage.

583
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,659
Fried outlets.

584
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,453
Mold.

585
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,663
I'm gonna need some more paper.

586
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,125
This would go a hell of a lot faster
if we knew what Danny had in mind.

587
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:01,710
Where is Danny?

588
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,713
We need keys to some of these places.

589
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,256
Check the front desk.

590
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,009
Only if Wednesday Adams
is on a break.

591
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,720
- Vic.
- Fine.

592
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:16,016
I'll go, but you go get your boyfriend.
This was all his idea.

593
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,251
Danny?

594
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,843
Danny?

595
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,598
Toni! Hey,

596
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,770
We could all use a little guidance
out there, please.

597
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,522
OK.

598
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,317
- Did you do all this?
- No.

599
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,321
- This is Jillian's.
- Yeah.

600
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,865
Was she trying to take these?

601
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,993
I don't know.

602
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,954
She and Bry were always going on
about selling things off.

603
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,789
Without asking you?

604
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,458
When it comes to money,
Bryan's done worse.

605
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,878
- Have you seen them anywhere?
- No.

606
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,633
Looks like they took off
with a few parting gifts.

607
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,218
That's not like them, though.

608
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,387
Well, I guess you never
really know anybody, huh?

609
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,514
We've known them for three years.

610
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,143
Yeah, all they've ever been about
is the quick and easy.

611
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:45,647
Bryan with his subprimes, and Jillian
playing the Manhattan socialite bitch.

612
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:48,233
- Danny!
- She's from Wisconsin.

613
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,236
I mean, I gave 'em a chance
to get in on the ground floor.

614
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:55,615
God forbid they ever achieve anything
in life by actually working for it.

615
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,076
- That's what I'm trying to do here.
- Wow, Danny.

616
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,328
- They are your friends.
- You know why Bryan's so eager

617
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,664
to get me back in the firm?

618
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,332
So he didn't have to do any work.

619
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,753
I always did the heavy lifting,
and look what that cost me.

620
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,839
They're my old life.
This... this is my new one.

621
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:14,176
My God! I am really trying hard
to be supportive right now,

622
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,887
but the only person I don't
feel like I know is you!

623
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,222
- What are you talking about?
- It is this place!

624
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,100
- You wanted to bring me here.
- Because I thought it was gonna help.

625
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,853
And it has!
Even Sally noticed the difference

626
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,439
- from when I got here.
- Oh, my God. Sally?

627
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,025
- Oh, don't start that again.
- You wanna bring up... No, no! No!

628
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,944
Her and her
brother/husband/cousin/whatever.

629
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,073
- Enough of that shit!
- They are the only ones

630
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,618
that we really know nothing about!
How do you not get that?

631
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,496
You wanna know something?
Go ask them yourself.

632
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,040
Yeah, have you?
Have you checked into

633
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,208
anything that
they've told you?

634
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,960
- They have been nothing but kind to me.
- And we haven't?

635
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,962
- You don't understand.
- Oh, my...

636
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:55,175
- These people are my...
- What?! What are they?!

637
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:58,845
Do you even know?
You don't even know, Danny!

638
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,681
FUCK you!

639
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,440
Did you get all that?

640
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,568
Look, it's OK. It's OK.

641
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:45,892
- Jackson? Sally?
- In here, Danny.

642
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,522
- I need to talk to you.
- And we with you.

643
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,984
There's so many things we need to
explain, we're just not sure how.

644
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:57,779
I'm sure this is already
so overwhelming for you.

645
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,157
- You could say that again.
- And we're thrilled that you're

646
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,993
- interested in the hotel.
- But it's already

647
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,079
just such a small aspect
of who we really are.

648
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,415
Who are you?

649
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,043
I think it's better if we show you.

650
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,379
But you gotta come alone.

651
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:18,133
There's members of the family
that have been aching to meet you.

652
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,510
- Let's go.
- Come on.

653
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,605
Wouldn't it be easier
to use a flashlight?

654
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,231
It's the way we do things.

655
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,443
You'll see.

656
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,266
- Who are all these people?
- They're all kin,

657
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,310
one way or another.

658
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,354
Come to welcome you home,
Danny.

659
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,801
How long have you been doing this?

660
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:47,347
We've known each other since our clans
first set foot in these hills.

661
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:50,600
There were three families
back in those days.

662
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,937
The Craytons, the Boggles
and the Hillickers.

663
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,523
- Which am I?
- You're Hillicker, Danny.

664
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,819
- And all of you?
- We're blood.

665
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:02,862
Yeah.

666
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,117
Our families tamed this land.

667
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,744
Reaped its rewards,
the coal, the timber.

668
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,872
Others tried to chisel in
on what we'd earned,

669
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,874
but we had birthright.

670
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,464
That's for the lady. That's for you.

671
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,183
- What's that?
- It's the family vintage.

672
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:50,702
See, like this brew,
Hobb Springs is a testament to family.

673
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:58,043
It's a place for our folk
to gather from far and wide.

674
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,051
With them came others.

675
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,929
Like your friends came with you.

676
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,394
And they bring temptation to stray.

677
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:21,232
Weakened our family, muddied our blood.

678
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:29,115
See, how do you preserve
family strength?

679
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,451
How do you keep it pure?

680
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,828
How?

681
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,663
We stick to our own.

682
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:44,923
There's nothing to fear, sweetie.
There's nothing to fear.

683
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:49,677
- What happened to them?
- It's the price of purity.

684
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,930
Purity...

685
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,264
Stick to our own...

686
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,142
That's right, Danny. Family.
Uncle, cousin.

687
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,727
Brother.

688
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,439
See, what was tradition
became ritual.

689
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:06,236
And that ritual preserved
our blood lines, it cleansed it even.

690
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:10,865
Our devotion was strong
and rewarded, but when it was weak...

692
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:17,747
So it's been for generations.

693
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:22,001
- Lately, everything has gone wrong.
- No child comes to terms.

694
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,296
The ones that do, they don't survive.

695
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,967
- And that's why we need you, Danny.
- Why?

696
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:32,095
See, only true blood will keep
this family alive.

697
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,222
What do you mean?

698
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,684
Danny, you and me.

699
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:40,854
Our blood is still true.

700
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,565
