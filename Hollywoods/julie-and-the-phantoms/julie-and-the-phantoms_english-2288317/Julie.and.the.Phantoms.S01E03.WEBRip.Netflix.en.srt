1
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,614
Hey, where'd the rest of the band go?

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,575
Wait. Were those holograms?

3
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,954
Yes! Yes, they were holograms.

4
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,332
I plugged it into the ceiling projector
before the show.

5
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,253
I'd explain it, but it involves algorithms
and science stuff.

6
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,303
That's wild.

7
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,181
They could see us when we were playing,
but not when the music ended.

8
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,640
We should double check.

9
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,063
Yeah, I don't...

10
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,356
I don't think they can see us.

11
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,609
I wish I couldn't see you.

12
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,487
OK, people, show's over.

13
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,614
Let's get back to class, please.

14
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,116
What was that? "Were those holograms?"

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,369
-Hey there. Hi. Reggie.
-What even is that? What was that?

16
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,497
Could I call you some time?
What's your number?

17
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,000
Mrs. Harrison, I am so sorry
for not asking for permission.

18
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,127
I just wanted to show you I belong here.

19
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,713
As amazing as that was,

20
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,299
your spot's already been filled
by another student.

21
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,807
Come on,
that thing is way too big for him!

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,266
He'll grow into it.

23
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,145
I wish that I could help you,
but my hands are tied.

24
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,900
Mine aren't, and as much as
I didn't approve of this little stunt

25
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,402
that you pulled,
I will not go down in history

26
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,406
as the principal who kicked Julie Molina
out of the music program.

27
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,700
Thank you!

28
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,618
But...

29
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,413
when you win your first Grammy,
I want to be thanked.

30
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,456
Definitely.

31
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,083
Thank you.

32
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,543
Congratulations!

33
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,836
Oh! Aw!

34
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,754
Welcome back.

35
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,052
Wow. You did it.

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,178
Thanks to you.

37
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,223
Hey, you OK?

38
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,933
Uh... I'm great.

39
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,019
When did you start playing
with a hologram band?

40
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,522
Oh, it was just one song.
We're not a band.

41
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,858
They're a band, a hologram band.

42
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,442
Definitely holograms.

43
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,861
Yeah, I saw.

44
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,822
Why have you been
keeping those cute boys a secret?

45
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,824
There's a reason for that.

46
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,577
It's just... really crazy.

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,787
Oh, I'm all about crazy. Let's hear it.

48
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,875
OK. Um, so they're...

49
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,044
from Sweden.

50
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,466
Yeah. Turns out they they're
not only great at making meatballs

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,469
but also good at making music.

52
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,389
Yeah, so they play there,
I stream them here, we play together,

53
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,849
they leave, then that's it.

54
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,102
Anyway, who's excited
that I'm back in the music program?

55
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,480
Jules, are you lying to me?

56
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,152
Yeah.

57
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,820
Yeah, I'm lying.

58
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,365
Since when do we lie to each other?

59
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,868
Flynn...

60
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,411
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,332
"I'm sorry"?
That's all you've got?

62
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,338
Wait, Flynn. Wait, no!

63
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,006
Come... Wait. Come on.

64
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,424
Flynn!

65
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,218
Come on, Flynn.

66
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,219
Wait!

67
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,304
Really?

68
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,640
Hey! Nice job!

69
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,851
Julie! Julie!
Those holograms were so cool.

70
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,273
It's like we were in Coachella, but, like,
not in the desert and without the sweat.

71
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,399
Thanks.

72
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,444
It's true.

73
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,613
That was incredible.

74
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,575
It was way better
than when you cried and ran out.

75
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,662
Hey, um...

76
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,498
maybe we should... get to science.

77
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,583
Uh, yeah, then maybe you can study

78
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,795
the chemical properties of manners
or something.

79
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,297
Was that supposed to be a comeback?

80
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,799
Wow.

81
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,217
Wow yourself.

82
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,134
Oh!

83
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,803
Another winner.

84
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,310
Hey, that was kind of cold.

85
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,104
You two used to be friends.

86
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,940
I've earned my chair, Nick.

87
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,318
Julie lost hers
after she didn't sing a note for a year.

88
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,611
Then suddenly,

89
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,156
she drops in unannounced to upstage me
with her little hologram act?

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,534
I worked hard on that routine.

91
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,162
Julie's no friend.

92
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,794
I stepped into that.

93
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,798
Julie!

94
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,259
You! Stop doing that!

95
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,468
I'm serious.

96
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,762
Whoa! This one's all on you.
We were already here.

97
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,933
Well, actually, we were over there,
and then we came over here.

98
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,643
Are we not gonna talk about what happened?

99
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,647
Yeah, the whole school saw you.
It's kinda freaking me out.

100
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,733
OK, good,
'cause it's kind of freaking me out too.

101
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,900
You know, you could see us,

102
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,777
and people could see us
whenever we play music.

103
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,863
And my clothes are made of air,
but for some reason,

104
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,364
I'm still getting a wedgie.

105
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,659
So many questions.

106
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,412
The important thing is
that we rocked that place.

107
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,621
They were loving you!

108
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,957
Are you kidding? They loved us.

109
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,876
That was a great song, Luke. Thanks.

110
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,587
And did you guys see
the cheerleaders looking at me?

111
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,921
I think they were looking at me.

112
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,049
Please tell me they were.

113
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,509
-Bro, they were looking at you.
-Oh, I knew it!

114
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,346
I'm so...
I'm so confused, you know?

115
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,639
The afterlife should come
with instructions

116
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,641
or a quick start guide or something.

117
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,436
Well, the good thing is that
everyone thought you guys were holograms,

118
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,730
and I got back into the program.

119
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,442
-Why do you look so bummed?
-Yeah, dude, you're making this face.

120
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,737
Hmph.

121
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,989
That... is not my face.

122
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,657
- Eh...
- It's your face.

123
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,077
And things just got weird
between me and Flynn.

124
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,245
She asked about you guys,
and I couldn't say.

125
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,498
Sweet. Girls are already talking about us.

126
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,000
Stop. I'm serious.

127
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,504
I can't tell her about you guys
for the same reason I can't tell my dad.

128
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,589
She'll think I've gone off the deep end.

129
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,925
This dude definitely thinks
you've gone off the deep end.

130
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,720
Hmm...

131
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,056
Mm.

132
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,392
I gotta get back to class.

133
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,186
Later, Julie.
Oh, tell those cheerleaders I'm single.

134
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,312
Oh, and that he's dead.

135
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,314
Oh no, no, no! Leave that part out.
Leave that...

136
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,607
- She's gone.
- Whoo!

137
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,324
I think he's practicing his model strut.

138
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,078
He's so nervous,
he's almost making me nervous.

139
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,123
OK, look,
you guys know I don't handle change well.

140
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,249
All right? Death?

141
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,543
That was a change.

142
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,586
OK? Then we became ghosts.

143
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,004
All right? Another change.

144
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,466
And... and now we can be seen
whenever we play with Julie.

145
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,760
Big freaking change!

146
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,054
Yeah, but, bro, it was a good change.

147
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,015
With Julie, we can play on stage again
and be the band we never got to be.

148
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,476
Come on.
I mean, you gotta be down for that.

149
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,562
Yeah, I mean, who wouldn't be? I just...

150
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,774
-You know, I wanna figure out why.
-Forget why.

151
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,360
Man, I say we invite Julie
to join Sunset Curve.

152
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,487
Yeah, totally.
I mean, like, think about it.

153
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,115
With a new lead singer,
this band would be legendary.

154
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,450
Hey!

155
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,617
I'm our lead singer.

156
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:36,205
Dude, that girl has the voice of an angel,
and she can make us visible.

157
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,833
Without her,
we're just like elevator music.

158
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,670
You don't gotta be so mean about it.
And we're on the runway again.

159
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,672
OK, I'm sorry, all right? I just...

160
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,550
I gotta go clear my head.

161
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,142
Dude, you're a ghost. Just poof out.

162
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,477
Don't tell me how to ghost!

163
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,612
Can I get a photo
with you and my family?

164
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,490
Great, thanks.

165
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,700
Awesome.

166
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,121
- Yeah. It's right over there.
- Yeah.

167
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

168
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,627
Oh God, I'm busted.

169
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,629
Oh God!

170
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,380
No!

171
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,971
- That'll be great.
- OK.

172
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,974
Beep beep!

173
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,851
Comin' through. Hey!

174
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,645
Oh! Nice hat.

175
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,647
Cheese!

176
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,068
Aah!

177
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,402
Ah.

178
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,074
Oh man!

179
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,159
Oh, you dinged my board.

180
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,204
I dinged your board?
Dude, you ran me over.

181
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,497
You're lucky I didn't...

182
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,626
Y-Y-You... you... you ran me over.

183
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,962
You're a ghost?

184
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,633
Mm. Yeah.
Ever since I learned the hard way that...

185
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,720
...skating in traffic was bad.

186
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,937
Hey, sorry I, uh, smashed into you.

187
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,523
I thought you were a lifer,
and I'd just pass right through.

188
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,441
Uh, a lifer?

189
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,361
Yeah, that's, uh...

190
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,739
That's what we call people who are living.

191
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,993
You're new to this whole ghost thing,
aren't you?

192
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,620
Yeah. Is it that obvious?

193
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,539
Totally.

194
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,208
Hey, I'm, uh... I'm Willie.

195
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,626
Oh, uh, Alex.

196
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,757
So, um, what brings you to Hollywood, man?

197
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,093
You, uh, sightseeing?
Picture with that, uh...

198
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,636
...Marilyn girl?

199
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,599
Uh... Yeah, actually,
I was having a minor afterlife crisis,

200
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,227
so, you know, just clearing my head
until you tried to crack it open.

201
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,230
I did pancake you, huh?

202
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,568
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,571
Um, so, minor afterlife crisis?

204
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,533
Yeah, I just... I just keep freaking out
about everything, you know?

205
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,577
Shouldn't we be in Heaven or something?

206
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,746
Who's we?

207
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,497
Oh, uh, me and my bandmates.

208
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,249
We all died.

209
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,167
Right.

210
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,962
Now, that's tragic, man.
You guys had some kind of accident, or...

211
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,422
Yeah.

212
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,966
Yeah, you could... you could say that.

213
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,135
We ate some bad hot dogs.

214
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,595
-Whoa! No way.
-Yeah.

215
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,764
Weirdly, that is what happened to Mozart.

216
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,850
Wow. That's actually comforting.
Thank you.

217
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,814
Hey, do you mind
if I ask you a couple more questions?

218
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,566
That's kind of your thing, isn't it?

219
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:52,777
All right.

220
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,570
You just gotta keep up.

221
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,325
Hey! Um... wait up!

222
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,168
- Dad!
- Aah!

223
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,212
Good. You're home.

224
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,505
What's all this?

225
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:17,134
Ah, just, you know, some stuff
on other schools with music programs

226
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,387
and... and some private lessons stuff.

227
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,098
I know it looks like a mess,
but your dad's got this.

228
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,558
Well, luckily for you,
I got back in at my school.

229
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,352
Wait. Wait, what?

230
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,437
You're not joking me now?

231
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,732
I went down,
I put on a show with some ghosts...

232
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,277
Getters, go-getters,
and Principal Lessa let me back in.

233
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,738
Yes! Yes!

234
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,365
Oh! Mm! Ohh!

235
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,076
You're awesome. I am so happy for you.

236
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,285
You are the best!

237
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,372
I got it. I got it.

238
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,710
"The Australian School of Music"?

239
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,920
That's halfway around the world.

240
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,464
I... I was gonna bring you home
for Christmas.

241
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,803
Hey, you rock.

242
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,971
The best.

243
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:03,889
Yes.

244
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,275
Reggie, what do you think of this riff?

245
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,113
Sweet. I'm feeling that.

246
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,243
And then I come in with a little, uh...

247
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,788
Then Julie comes in
with her killer lyrics.

248
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,874
And Sunset Curve is reborn.

249
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,588
Guys, you aren't supposed to be out here
playing alone.

250
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,299
But we're not alone,
'cause we always have each other.

251
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,633
Ugh!

252
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,262
But... but we had the volume level on one.

253
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,099
But we rocked it on volume ten.
You want us to play it again?

254
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,519
I really don't think she does.

255
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,645
No.

256
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,148
We've been waiting for you to get home.

257
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,026
OK, so we have some pretty major news
to tell you.

258
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,986
We had a band meeting earlier, and...

259
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,699
we wanna invite you to join Sunset Curve.
And no, you're not dreaming.

260
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,369
Oh.

261
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,165
Oh, uh... Oh, she said, "Oh." Um...

262
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,793
That's what you say
when you get socks on your birthday,

263
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,836
not when invited
to join the most epic band ever.

264
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,256
Sorry. I'm honored, but I can't think
about anything but Flynn right now.

265
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,092
She's still mad at me for lying.
She hasn't even texted me back.

266
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,345
-Yeah, you're in a tough spot.
-Yeah.

267
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,555
So, you wanna join the band?

268
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,641
Read the room, dude.

269
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,518
Oh come on!

270
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,895
We need you,
and you need us because you need music.

271
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,939
We found this poem that you wrote,

272
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,358
and Reggie and I,
we added this really cool melody to it.

273
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,400
It sounds awesome.

274
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,652
Where'd you find that?

275
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,947
Uh... definitely not your dream box.

276
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,074
-You went through my stuff?
-I know, but...

277
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,451
-Yeah, we can do that now.
-No! No, you can't!

278
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,328
Boundaries! Give it back!

279
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:53,207
No! Hey, you need to realize
how insanely talented you are.

280
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,084
OK? Listen to this.

281
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,710
"If somebody hurts you...

282
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,171
If somebody hurts you,
I'm gonna get hurt too."

283
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,258
♪ And my life
My life would be real low, zero ♪

284
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,759
♪ Flying solo♪

285
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,927
♪ Oh-oh!♪

286
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,681
It's a killer melody.

287
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,975
I wrote that about Flynn

288
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,310
when she was helping me
with all my mom stuff.

289
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,771
I gotta go.

290
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,731
Hey, what about the band?

291
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,317
Oh... I almost forgot.

292
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,777
Stay out of my room!

293
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:24,738
Yeah?

294
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,740
We will if you join our band.

295
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,536
I mean, it's just...
it's just so random, you know,

296
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,329
that we disappear for 25 years,

297
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,499
and then Julie plays our CD, and then bam!
We're back.

298
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,669
It's kind of funny, right? You thought
when you died you'd get all these answers,

299
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,629
and now you just have more questions.

300
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:42,923
Hilarious.

301
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,512
Why did he...

302
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,396
So, who's this, um... Julie?

303
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,025
Oh, she's the girl that discovered us.
Did I mention she can see us?

304
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,152
You understand
my whole freaking out thing?

305
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,154
A lifer can see you?

306
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,947
Yeah, man. No, it gets crazier. All right?

307
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,908
This morning,
we're playing music with her,

308
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,201
we become visible to her entire school.

309
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,538
Whoa, I've never heard
of that happening before.

310
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,750
Maybe this Julie's connected
to your unfinished business.

311
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,585
Mm-hmm.

312
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,128
Yes. Totally.

313
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,839
I would completely agree if I had any clue
what you're talking about.

314
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,342
Right. Um... unfinished business.

315
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,761
It's why people become ghosts
when they die.

316
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,930
There's still something
they need to accomplish,

317
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,681
and once they complete it...

318
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,224
...they can cross over.

319
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,312
OK, so how do we figure out
what our unfinished business is?

320
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,231
I don't know.
You know, some ghosts never do.

321
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,984
I still haven't. But, you know,
I'm not too worried about it

322
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,654
because being a ghost
lets me do my favorite thing...

323
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,032
skate anywhere I want
without getting busted.

324
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,743
I mean, bro,
when I'm not skating here or the beach,

325
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,787
I'm skating Justin Bieber's empty pool.

326
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,997
-Wow!
-Yeah.

327
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,832
Who's that?

328
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,337
You seriously have so much
to catch up on, bro. Dang!

329
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,716
All right. I'll catch you later, hotdog.

330
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,052
I really don't like that nickname.

331
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,261
It's how I died!

332
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,265
He's cute, huh?

333
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,061
♪ Guess that means
I'm buying lunch that day♪

334
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,106
♪ I know all your secrets
You know all my deep dish♪

335
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,732
♪ Guess that means that some things... ♪

336
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,359
Wait, so...

337
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:29,613
When she says, "deep dish,"
is she talking about, like, pizza, or...

338
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,825
Oh! Oh, hey, man. Where you been?

339
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,120
Um, kind of everywhere.
Yeah. No, I met a new ghost friend.

340
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,037
For real?

341
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,373
Yeah, he answered a ton of questions.

342
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,084
Yeah? Like whether Julie
was gonna join the band or not?

343
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,045
Um... Well, we didn't...

344
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,966
We didn't really get to that,
but I think I know why we're here.

345
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,719
OK? All ghosts have,
like, unfinished business.

346
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,680
So, we need to do our unfinished business
so that we can cross over.

347
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,806
Why would we do that?

348
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,767
I'm just saying,
this is like our second chance.

349
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,644
All we need to do
is get Julie to play with us.

350
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,647
Yeah. Not only can that girl sing,
she can write too.

351
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,358
Luke and I made a killer melody
to one of her lyrics.

352
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,861
Oh...

353
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,989
Without your drummer. Cool.

354
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,283
Drumming is so '90s. OK?

355
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,618
We're just gonna... stomp our feet now.

356
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,536
OK.

357
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,955
Well, you know what else is so '90s?

358
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,958
Being rude. All right? Get woke.
These are sensitive times.

359
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,918
Ah! Alex...

360
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,128
Ow.

361
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,921
Learned that
from my ghost friend.

362
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,757
- Woke.
- Yeah.

363
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,842
-That's... That's a cool word.
-Yeah.

364
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,385
-What does it mean?
-No clue.

365
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,521
Flynn!

366
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,983
What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over for you.

367
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,487
Not everywhere, 'cause here I am.

368
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,197
I've been texting you all day.

369
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,449
The least you could have done
is text me back.

370
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,744
I sent a poop emoji.
I think it said everything.

371
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,579
I was just leaving this.

372
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,458
-I won't need it anymore.
-I'm not taking it.

373
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,044
Fine. Then my dad
can wash his car with it,

374
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,963
though all this betrayal on it
might scratch his paint.

375
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,092
Look, I'm very sorry for not telling you.

376
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,220
But I-I need you to know
how important you are to me.

377
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,181
There's no way I would've made it
through this year if it wasn't for you.

378
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,392
Yet it was three strangers
who got you back into music.

379
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,356
I don't need someone in my life
who lies and keeps things from me.

380
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,399
Goodbye, Julie.

381
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,568
They're ghosts.

382
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:32,861
What?

383
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,198
The boys in my band.
They aren't holograms.

384
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,701
They're ghosts. And when we play together,
people can see them.

385
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,203
What do you mean "ghosts"?

386
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,789
Like the kind that rattle chains
and go "boo"?

387
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,000
No. And I'm pretty sure
that's just a hurtful ghost stereotype.

388
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,129
These guys are just normal dead dudes.

389
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,965
Well... Reggie's a little questionable.

390
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,509
Who are you texting?

391
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,345
Your dad. He told me to text him
if I was worried about you.

392
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,555
And, um...

393
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,181
I'm worried.

394
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,308
You're seeing things, Jules.

395
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,520
All right. So you wanna be difficult?

396
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,190
Meet me in my mom's studio in 30 minutes,

397
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,818
and I'll prove to you that I'm not crazy.

398
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,279
And please don't text my dad.

399
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,282
You have 30 minutes.

400
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,202
Eggs?

401
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,372
-Why did you bring eggs?
-Oh! Um... No.

402
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,040
No.

403
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,960
See, I grabbed those by mistake.

404
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,505
It's not like I was gonna throw them
at your bedroom window or anything.

405
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,092
Thirty minutes! Go.

406
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,687
Thanks for coming.

407
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,856
We just wanted to rehearse the song
so it was perfect,

408
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,816
which it's not, but whatever.

409
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,445
No, if I'm gonna hear a song
from your imaginary ghost band,

410
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,031
I want it to be perfect.
So, get back in there.

411
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,158
All of you. You too.

412
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,452
They're not out here.

413
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,287
Oh, I know.

414
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,712
All right, guys. You ready?

415
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,508
Uh, actually, can you go over there?
Reggie needs some space to rock out,

416
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,511
and he feels kinda weird
walking through you.

417
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,390
Boy, when you create a world,
you really live in it.

418
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,600
Just sit!

419
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,143
Oh!

420
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,688
If you'll notice, there's no equipment
that will produce a hologram.

421
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,023
Feel free to look around.

422
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,490
The guys took a poem that
I wrote about you and put it to music.

423
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,576
Aww! I wish I didn't have
to talk to your dad after this.

424
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,995
It's called "Flying Solo."

425
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,499
