1
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,996
This is awesome, you guys.
We're playing the Orpheum!

2
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,832
I can't even count
how many bands have played here

3
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,625
and then ended up being huge.

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,128
We're gonna be legends.

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,382
Eat up, boys, 'cause after tonight,

6
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,718
everything changes.

7
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,980
Is this seat taken?

8
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,575
This whole thing sucks.

9
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,914
Yeah, I messed up.

10
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,541
No, it's like you said...

11
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,127
you know, you didn't have a choice.

12
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,505
I mean, Caleb owns your soul.

13
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,048
No.

14
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,802
No, still, I know what he's capable of.
I brought you guys right to him.

15
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,387
When you guys asked me,
I should've just skated away.

16
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,933
I would have still followed you.

17
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:44,979
Man...

18
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,023
I would do anything

19
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,858
to take back what I did to you.

20
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,112
I am so sorry.

21
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,533
I mean, did you guys figure out
what your unfinished business is?

22
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,869
Not like it's gonna happen.

23
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,499
We have to play here.

24
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,587
The... the Orpheum?

25
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,506
Yeah, I mean, we were two hours away

26
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,800
from getting on that stage
the night we died.

27
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,469
You guys were gonna be legends.

28
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,014
We were.

29
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,566
I don't know why you guys want these,
but OK.

30
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,608
Thank you, Julie.

31
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,360
- Let me see!
- Yeah!

32
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,904
Can I get a selfie too?

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,865
I have to check with security.

34
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,326
Oh wait. I don't have any.

35
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,703
Yeah, you laugh,

36
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,289
but after last night's performance,
it's pretty clear:

37
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,500
-you guys are gonna blow up.
-Pfft! It was just a garage party.

38
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,127
-Don't go all crazy on me.
-Um,

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,962
sorry I couldn't stay for the whole thing.

40
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,506
-I had a ton of homework.
-It's fine. Thanks for coming.

41
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,757
Thanks for inviting me.

42
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,051
See you around.

43
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,428
So, um, listen.

44
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,347
Since we make such a great team,
you know, with dance and everything...

45
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,351
and, uh, you have an A in history,
any chance we could be study partners?

46
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,770
I'd love to,

47
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,481
but with the band,
I'm not sure I'll have any free time.

48
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,441
Sorry.

49
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,276
Oh, nah, no worries. Um...

50
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,111
Then, I'll ask you this:

51
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,823
any chance you could find time
to go on a date with me?

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,452
Wow, Nick wants to go on a date with me.

53
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,454
You'd know that, 'cause you're him.

54
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,039
I am.

55
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,584
I'm flattered.

56
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,669
Really. You're great.

57
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,213
Really great.

58
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,591
That doesn't sound like a yes.

59
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,054
You...
You like someone else, don't you?

60
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,348
Yeah, kinda.

61
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,600
Guess I, uh...

62
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,518
...missed my chance. Um...

63
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,396
OK, then. Still dance partners, right?

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,482
Yeah. Of course.

65
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,900
OK.

66
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,819
And awkward exit.

67
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,363
Um... See ya.

68
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,739
See ya.

69
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,327
Well, that wasn't just a "What's up?"

70
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,870
Nick wanted to go on a date.

71
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,289
And I said no.

72
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,499
What?

73
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,000
You know what you said.

74
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,670
This Luke thing isn't going away
any time soon,

75
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,297
so I... I figured why waste Nick's time?

76
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,259
Aww! My baby's all grown up.

77
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,262
She's choosing to like someone
who doesn't really exist,

78
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,429
but she's all grown up.

79
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,015
But he does exist. To me.

80
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,353
And he might just be air,
but we connect in so many other ways.

81
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,730
You are the most watchable duet-ers
I've ever seen.

82
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,233
But it's not just singing.

83
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,944
When we write,
we're drawing from the same pain.

84
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,822
We both know how it feels
to lose our moms.

85
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,534
Do not make me cry.
I'm having a really good eyeliner day.

86
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,537
It's just... Luke's hurting so much,

87
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,580
I wish I could help him.

88
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,001
Maybe you could write him a song!
That would make him feel better!

89
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,503
Oh my gosh, Flynn, you're a genius!

90
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,381
-Julie, you still have class.
-Right.

91
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,009
Like I said... genius.

92
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,220
Hmm... Wow!

93
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,849
Ooh, I like this one.
It's got a good composition, buddy.

94
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,476
What are you doin'?

95
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,395
Eh, I needed a pick-me-up,

96
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,605
and hanging with Ray
always does the trick.

97
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,526
Does it?

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,278
OK.

99
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,448
-Dad, I have a ghost update.
-OK, this might be interesting.

100
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,700
Really? Come on, Carlos,
we've talked about this.

101
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,660
I know you're not a believer,
but listen to this.

102
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,537
-Do I have a choice?
-No.

103
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,872
You go, little man.

104
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,833
After Julie played with her hologram band
last night, I couldn't sleep.

105
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,501
Those songs do get stuck in your head.

106
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,463
-He likes our new music too.
-Ah, still doesn't count.

107
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,382
I learned on YouTube that ghosts haunt
because something's bothering them.

108
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,511
So to get rid of them, you gotta find out
what crawled up their ghost butts!

109
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,597
- He said "ghost butts."
- Language.

110
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,514
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

111
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,392
So, I searched the house for clues
on who used to live here.

112
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,187
And I found a bunch of old stuff
in the garage.

113
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,980
What I learned is

114
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,774
we're being haunted by a ghost...

115
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,192
who had a dream.

116
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,526
OK.

117
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,821
A dream that never came true.

118
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,865
A dream that was cut short...

119
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,159
by a tragic accident.

120
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,578
OK, you... you don't actually think--

121
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,789
Our house... is being haunted...

122
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,249
by a very talented...

123
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,542
chef.

124
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,506
Looks like somebody fell asleep
watching Ghost Hunters and Chopped.

125
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,383
You know how there are
two restaurants in LA

126
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,843
that claim
they've invented the French dip?

127
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,596
Guess what I found in this shoebox?

128
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,514
A recipe...

129
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,809
for a third French dip!

130
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,685
-No way!
-No way!

131
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,396
It was invented in 1905...

132
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,814
by a guy who...

133
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,982
dreamed of a soggy sandwich.

134
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,860
But died before he could share his gift.

135
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,613
Ah... the gift of dipping.

136
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,115
It's like we're the same person.

137
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,533
Just like!

138
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,327
So we gotta make his sandwich,
and we gotta eat it.

139
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,495
Oh, then,

140
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,414
he'll see his dream realized

141
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,416
and finally leave this world for good.

142
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,834
So are you in?

143
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,752
Yeah, let's make a dream come true.

144
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,711
All right.

145
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,797
I do love French dips.

146
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,841
I'm gonna miss them.

147
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,676
Me too.

148
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,657
Luke!

149
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,451
What are you doing here?

150
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,410
OK, look.

151
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,789
I... I just wanted to know more about you,
you know, just curious. Um...

152
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,084
So, I came here last week
on your birthday.

153
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,752
You were spying on me?

154
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,088
Even after all your speeches
about boundaries?

155
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,798
-You were spying on me?
-I know.

156
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,717
I'm sorry. It was wrong.

157
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,136
But I'm worried about you.

158
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,096
You don't have to be.

159
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,224
I get it.

160
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,687
I know how hard it is when you want
to speak to someone you love and can't.

161
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,773
I feel that way every day.

162
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,570
I don't even know what I'd say to her,
even if she could hear me.

163
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,988
Yes, you do.

164
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,073
You've already said it.

165
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,286
Trust me.

166
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,222
Hello. Can I help you?

167
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,265
Hi. I'm Julie.

168
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,517
Um...

169
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,810
I believe you had a son named Luke?

170
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,271
Yes, that's right.

171
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,899
And you are again?

172
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,484
Julie Molina.

173
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,529
Um... your son's band used to play
in my family's garage?

174
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,410
I... I came across this song that he wrote

175
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,454
and figured you might be interested?

176
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,499
Um...

177
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,500
Well, yes.

178
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,878
Uh, please... please come in.
I'm... I'm Mitch.

179
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,047
Nice to meet you.

180
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,556
Can I, um, get you something?

181
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,392
Oh, no. I'm good. Thank you.

182
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,145
Is this your son?

183
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,232
Yeah, that's Luke.

184
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,858
When he was two.

185
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,236
Do you have any other children?

186
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,238
No.

187
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,491
Did I hear the doorbell?

188
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,868
Hi, hon. Um, this is Julie.

189
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,829
Hello, Julie.

190
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,206
Oh, that's a beautiful sweater.

191
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,126
Thanks. It's my mom's.

192
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,379
Julie lives in the house
where Luke and the band rehearsed.

193
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,966
She was just telling me
she found a song that Luke wrote.

194
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,553
It's a song about a girl named Emily?

195
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,680
- Emily...
- Oh...

196
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,641
I'm Emily.

197
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,396
Then I think your son
may have written this song for you.

198
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,151

Thank you.

250
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,326
Um...

251
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,912
You... you have no idea...

252
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,335
I write music
in the same room that he did,

253
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,464
and I can tell you
it is a magical, happy place.

254
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,427
That's so nice to know.

255
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,763
I know he was only 17

256
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,723
when he...

257
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,728
But he lived doing the one thing
he was born to do.

258
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,106
Not many people find that,

259
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,941
but Luke did.

260
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,110
He was lucky.

261
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,326
It was so nice to meet you.

262
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,537
It was nice to meet you too.

263
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,686
Hey.

264
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,688
Hey.

265
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,442
I'm sorry for overstepping.

266
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,527
No, I...

267
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,029
I just had to leave.

268
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,615
-That was...
-You don't have to say anything.

269
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,074
Yeah, I do. Uh...

270
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,330
I didn't have many regrets in my life
except for running out on my parents.

271
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,956
Especially my mom, so...

272
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,250
thank you.

273
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,211
You helped me feel
more connected to my mom, so...

274
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,881
I wanted to do the same thing for you.

275
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,592
That was perfect.

276
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,226
This is an interesting little relationship
you and I have.

277
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,776
Oh my gosh, I almost forgot to tell you.

278
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,946
Flynn said the video that my dad made
is trending on YouTube.

279
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,742
That's a good thing.
That means people love our music.

280
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,953
We'll definitely be getting calls
from managers now.

281
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,665
There's something I have to tell you.

282
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,417
Oh... OK.

283
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,380
We figured out
that we have unfinished business.

284
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,465
That's why we came back as ghosts.

285
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,092
Oh.

286
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,551
What is it?

287
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,721
We have to play the show
we never got to play.

288
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,516
At the Orpheum? That makes sense.

289
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,480
-We don't have a lot of time.
-What was that? Are you OK?

290
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:25,150
We did something that we shouldn't have.
The night that we missed the dance,

291
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,361
we met this ghost,
and he put this curse on us.

292
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,823
And if we don't do what he says,
then those jolts will destroy us.

293
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,200
Then you gotta do what he says.
What does he want?

294
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,744
He wants us to be in his house band
for eternity.

295
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,080
But if we can play the Orpheum soon,

296
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,541
then we can avoid all that
and actually cross over.

297
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,292
"Cross over"?

298
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,379
As in, like what? Like go to heaven?

299
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,256
That's what we're banking on.

300
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,719
So it's either you cross over,
be in his band for eternity,

301
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,721
or be destroyed by those jolts?

302
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,348
Yeah.

303
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,768
That's just great.

304
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,855
Julie...

305
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,911
Hey. I got your text.

306
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,665
Don't come too close.
Anyone I seem to care about disappears.

307
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,167
You can't get rid of me.

308
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,294
I'm like the crazy glue of best friends.

309
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,089
I just don't get it.
Right when my life starts to get good.

310
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,301
Great friend, great band, great guy...

311
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,594
then bam!

312
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,680
I seriously don't know
why all of this is happening to you,

313
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,141
but that's gonna be
a great album cover one day.

314
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,980
You don't have to do that.

315
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,692
I know, but I get to check out
all your mom's cool stuff.

316
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,653
Whoa...

317
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,739
Did you know this was in here?

318
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,783
What the heck?

319
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,284
How do you think she got it?

320
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,370
I... I don't know,
but the guys said they didn't know my mom.

321
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,664
Why would they lie?

322
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,001
Maybe they didn't.

323
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,005
Maybe she knew them.
She could be a fan!

324
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,802
I mean, Sunset Curve was playing
the Hollywood club scene around then.

325
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,220
Oh my gosh.

326
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,013
What if you were right?

327
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,641
What if the guys are connected
to your mom?

328
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,601
You know, through music or something.

329
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,229
Because she bought their T-shirt?

330
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,939
Think about it.

331
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,733
They were the ones
who made you wanna play music again.

332
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,360
Maybe she knew they could help you.

333
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,531
So, you mean to tell me that my mom
is somewhere out there planning all this?

334
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,201
If she wanted me to play music again,
why wouldn't she just tell me herself?

335
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,329
Maybe she can't.
Maybe she has to do it another way.

336
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,249
You know, through signs.

337
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,501
You've been through these clothes
how many times

338
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,002
and haven't found this T-shirt?

339
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,712
Why now?

340
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,048
This is another sign.

341
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,175
I'm just saying.

342
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,261
It's not over, Julie!

343
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,263
Really? "Signs"?

344
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,974
You're in a ghost band.

345
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,142
It's a crazy world.

346
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,686
Look...

347
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,646
you're gonna lose them

348
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,356
no matter what.

349
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,817
And it sucks.

350
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,987
But they helped bring you back to life.

351
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,281
Now it's your turn to help them.

352
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,658
They have to cross over.

353
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,660
Let them go.

354
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,632
Ah!

355
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,760
Snap out of it!

356
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,764
Jeez, I think you broke Alex.

357
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,975
Do you guys want to cross over or what?

358
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,855
Get it together!

359
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,857
They're never gonna let us
play the Orpheum.

360
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,026
-We're nobody.
-We're less than nobody.

361
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,069
We have no bodies.

362
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,281
Someone once told me
that you don't ask for permission.

363
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,700
You book gigs by doing.

364
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,118
That was me.

365
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,912
-No, it wasn't.
-No, it wasn't.

366
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,331
- Yes, it was.
- This isn't over.

367
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,626
We were brought together for a reason:
to help each other.

368
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,960
Yeah, but like Luke said,

369
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,796
people don't just play the Orpheum
because they want to.

370
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,548
People don't,

371
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,133
but ghosts do.

372
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,514
