1
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,148
I don't know about this.

2
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,320
Well, if you get scared,
you... you can always hide behind me.

3
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,073
I'll be hiding behind Luke.

4
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,825
You guys need to grow up, OK?

5
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,410
We're gonna get back at Bobby.

6
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,830
He needs to pay for what he did to us.

7
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:39,873
Yeah.

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,751
I'm still gonna hide behind him.

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,878
We're all good.

10
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,589
Oh, uh, cool. Hey, just so you know,
we have, like, an hour,

11
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,090
because we got a gig with Julie.

12
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,341
Oh yeah. No worries.

13
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,384
-Cool.
-Let's go.

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,388
Normally, I'd have my deck,
and I'd backboard this heavy 20 set,

15
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,640
but tonight... we have company.

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,601
Hope you guys are ready for this.

17
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,062
Whoo!

18
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,731
Wow!

19
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,108
Are you guys seeing what I'm seeing?

20
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,694
- I think we're a little overdressed.
- Hmm.

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,704
It is terrific.

22
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,793
Whoa! I thought these people
were all going to be ghosts.

23
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,461
These are all lifers.

24
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,046
Oh, uh, lifers are actually...

25
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,090
Alive people. I was listening.

26
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,801
But this is a very exclusive crowd.

27
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,638
Everybody here has, uh, paid a lot
to get a sneak peek at the afterlife.

28
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,390
I always knew
rich people did weird stuff like this.

29
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,559
Gentlemen, I have a table for you.

30
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,644
Right this way.

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,115
William.

32
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,825
Oh yeah. Thanks, man.

33
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,036
OK. So who's gonna make us visible
so we can confront our old bandmate?

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,831
Oh no, no. None of these lifers
have the power to do that.

35
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,127
Oh, but here comes the ghost who does.

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,463
Ladies and gentlemen,
back from the dead by popular demand,

37
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,715
please welcome Caleb Covington!

38
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,717
Woo-hoo-hoo!

39
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,303
Woo-hoo-hoo!

40
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,597
Did you miss me?

41
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,141
Oh yeah!

42
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,560
I did too!

43
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,271
Welcome...

44
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,566
to the party of your dreams!

45
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,693
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

46
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,405
From the Egyptians to the Druids,

47
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,449
to the person sitting next to you,
we've all wondered,

48
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,118
"Where do we go

49
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,704
when that final light is snuffed out?"

50
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,707

Yeah! Whoo!

107
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,798
Hi.

108
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,549
This is so cool.

109
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,593
Man, dude, I knew I recognized him.

110
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,762
He's the guy that bumped into me
outside the Orpheum.

111
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,307
Wait. Isn't he that magician dude
that died a horrible death doing a trick?

112
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,684
Yeah, I wouldn't really bring that up
when we meet him.

113
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,187
Yeah, but you should come back
when he shows one of his movies.

114
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,065
I mean, for Titanic,
he literally floods the entire place.

115
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,025
I mean, the guy has got skills.

116
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,237
All right, but he can wave his arms
and make ghosts visible to lifers?

117
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,030
Told you, the guy's got skills.

118
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,615
So where'd he go?

119
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,826
Oh wow! Found him! Ha!

120
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,369
Hello, boys. Caleb Covington.

121
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,329
Welcome to the Hollywood Ghost Club.

122
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,664
Enjoying the show?

123
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,041
Yo, that was...
I mean... Did you... Like...

124
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,668
-I know.
-Right?

125
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,753
This is Alex, Luke, and Reggie.

126
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,839
Yeah, it's really nice to meet you.

127
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,132
'Sup?

128
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,299
The pleasure is mine.

129
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:09,595
Nothing warms my heart more
than sharing this magic with new friends.

130
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,721
Please, sit. Sit.

131
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,224
Uh, thank you for the invite.

132
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,725
Of course. Of course!

133
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:20,648
Now, my friend Willie tells me
that you boys have some magic of your own.

134
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,944
Well...

135
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,070
Willie and I?

136
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,198
I mean, I wouldn't really call it magic,
but, I mean...

137
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,576
Oh no, he means your ghost abilities.

138
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,871
You know, like, to be seen by everybody
when you play with Julie.

139
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,374
No, totally.

140
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,750
Right. No.

141
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,795
'Cause when you said it, I was like,
"Is that what he said?" 'Cause...

142
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,716
Yeah, but we can't really, uh,
wave our arms and do all this magic stuff.

143
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:51,888
Well, I've had some practice.
Our gifts are so rare, so special.

144
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,475
It's not often I come across other spirits
who possess similar talents.

145
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,226
It's no surprise we found each other.

146
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,395
Yeah, that definitely...

147
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,523
If you'll forgive me, fellas,
I gotta go pay the bills,

148
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,359
if you know what I'm saying.
I'll be back later to chat.

149
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,323
My darling! Oh, look at that dress!
Where have you been?

150
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,160
I love that dude. Please tell me
this party's never gonna end.

151
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,914
Is everybody fired up
for Julie and the Phantoms?

152
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,169
Great! Keep that fire 'cause that's later.

153
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,670
We're a bit behind schedule,

154
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,924
but don't worry,
just enjoy these mind-blowing beats.

155
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,265
Julie and the Phantoms?

156
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,227
I had some free time in French class.
And you'd better like it

157
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,480
because I registered it
on Insta, Snapchat, Twitter...

158
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,607
No, I love it.

159
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,152
But I'd love it even more
if the actual Phantoms were here.

160
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,365
Nick!

161
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,700
Look, Flynn, it's Nick.

162
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,953
Thanks for the introduction.

163
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,497
So you made it.

164
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,581
Wouldn't miss it.

165
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,751
The truth is
I can't wait to see you play again.

166
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,796
Your song has been stuck in my head
for weeks.

167
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,006
Well, someone should let it out.

168
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,511
I don't know what that meant, either.

169
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,555
I like your shoes.

170
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,058
Thanks.
I just like to doodle on them sometimes.

171
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:25,022
I can't tell
if the crowd is getting restless or bored.

172
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,108
Never a good sign.

173
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,944
Oh, hi, Julie. Got a new bag?

174
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,948
Actually, it's my hologram projector.
Just did a little upgrade.

175
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,284
Oh, so simple.

176
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:40,371
You know, I was expecting something
a little more... sophisticated.

177
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,124
It's what's on the inside that counts.

178
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,711
Yeah, that's what a lot
of people have to tell themselves.

179
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,129
Come on, Nick.

180
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,891
Keep it funky, y'all!

181
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,611
Is there a place to put in a request?

182
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,779
Because I request we leave.

183
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,698
Come on. Flynn's great.

184
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,367
What is it with you and these girls?

185
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,910
I'm at a dance.

186
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,412
There's music.

187
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,372
Why can't you just chill?

188
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,125
I'm sorry, but there's something
about amateur night

189
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,252
that makes me a little queasy.

190
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,630
-Look, all I'm saying is that--
-What?

191
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,761
Nothing. I'm gonna get something to drink.

192
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,154
They made eight more Star Wars movies,

193
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,781
and they killed Han Solo?

194
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,494
What kind of future is this?

195
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,334
We found out, like, two weeks ago, OK?
We just didn't have the heart to tell him.

196
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,045
But just please don't mention Jar Jar.

197
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,755
That was one crazy show.

198
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,884
So I'm guessing all these lifers are,
like, sworn to secrecy or something?

199
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,844
Or... something, yeah.

200
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,638
Let's just say
Caleb's offered everyone here,

201
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:24,850
with their membership, the opportunity
to experience this for eternity.

202
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,103
And they've all happily accepted.

203
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,233
And all these ghosts, they just wanna,
like, party forever and never cross over?

204
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,609
I mean, yeah, man.

205
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,112
Why would you wanna cross over
when you can just...

206
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,530
hang out and, you know...

207
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,199
do this forever?

208
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,622
There's a lot to, um...

209
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,541
like here.

210
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,716
Oh, you got a crush on Willie.

211
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,925
What? No.

212
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,385
No, man, no. We're just...

213
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,637
Alex, I'm happy for you.

214
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,266
You guys are not gonna believe this,

215
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,769
but someone just told me
they added a character named Jar Jar.

216
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,979
What's a Jar Jar?

217
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,815
I take it
you boys are enjoying yourselves?

218
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,401
Yeah, I mean, you'd have to be insane
to have a bad time here.

219
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,987
Well, entertainment is our specialty.

220
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,364
So now, I understand
there's something I can help you with.

221
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,615
Yeah, we hope so.

222
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,826
There's an old buddy of ours
who ripped us off big time,

223
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,828
- and we wanna make things right.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,456
We wanna look him in the eyes
and make him admit what he did to us.

225
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,500
So if you could make us visible,
that would be perfect.

226
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,588
Well, sure, I could do that,
but we're at a party.

227
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,758
Why focus on those who have wronged us
when we're among friends?

228
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,636
Now, I understand that the three of you
are talented musicians. I doubt...

229
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,139
your dream is to settle a score.

230
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,184
No, your dreams are bigger than that!

231
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,268
You're like me,

232
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,773
born to perform your music
in front of sold-out crowds.

233
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,275
Please sit.

234
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,696
What if I were to tell you

235
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,407
that with a wave of my hand,

236
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,160
you could share the spotlight with me...

237
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,370
and join my house band?

238
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,582
We... We already have a band.

239
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,875
Yes. Yes.

240
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,085
But when you're done performing,

241
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,046
you disappear.

242
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,256
You cease to exist.

243
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,051
No bows.

244
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,262
No... no soaking up the applause.

245
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,348
No real connection with the audience.

246
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,309
Yeah?
Here the audience knows what you are,

247
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,560
and more importantly,

248
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,813
they know how special you are.

249
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,360
Well, it could be cool to play here.

250
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,403
Oh, it... it's not just here.

251
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,366
We party like this all over the world.

252
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,536
Tonight, Hollywood. Tomorrow, Paris.

253
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,287
Oh là là!

254
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,789
It is...

255
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,916
all of your dreams come true...

256
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,417
forever.

257
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,633
I'm gonna give you some time
to think about it.

258
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,219
Oh, by the way,
make sure you try the sliders.

259
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,470
They're to die for.

260
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,638
W-W-We can eat?

261
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,598
Here you can.

262
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,601
-Oh, yea--
-Wait!

263
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,855
I want the one without cheese.

264
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,445
I just want a little bit.

265
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,990
-Are these good too?
-Try one of these.

266
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,325
-This is a meatball sub!
-Oh, pizza.

267
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,451
Oh my God!

268
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,662

275
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,889
I can only stall for so long.
It's eleven o'clock.

276
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,765
I think you should just play by yourself.

277
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,476
I mean, holograms or no holograms,
you'll be amazing.

278
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,020
You saw me the other day.

279
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,563
I can't play without them.

280
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,981
They'll be here.

281
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,399
They have to.

282
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,446
Lookin' good, Bobcats!

283
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,865
Issues?

284
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,284
Always.

285
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,493
My machine won't work.

286
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,704
You don't have to.

287
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,133
Here's... the problem.

288
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,232
That is unless...
you didn't want it plugged in.

289
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,451
Hey, don't let this crowd freak you out.

290
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,621
What I saw last time you played
was insane.

291
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,665
You got this.

292
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,752
I knew you had it in you.

293
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,920
Wait. What?

294
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,254
Yeah!

295
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,298
Hey, everybody!

296
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,760
We fixed the hologram thing.
Who wants to see a show?

297
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,388
Come on.

298
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,684
Now... give it up...

299
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,396
for Julie and the Phantoms!

300
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,315
Let's do it!

301
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,776
Come on! Come on.

302
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,363
Here you go.

303
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,075
Uh...

304
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,243
Hi.

305
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,664
So here's the thing...

306
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,793
...even though we got the machine fixed,
thanks to Nick...

307
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,713
Way to go, Nick!

308
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,174
I can't seem to link up with the guys.

309
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,261
Wi-Fi, am I right?

310
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,311
I'm sorry, but...

311
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,148
I'm gonna have to cancel.

312
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,357
What?

313
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,608
Are you serious?

314
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,694
I'm leaving!

315
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,238
Um...

316
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,157
Anybody know the Heimlich?

317
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,742
Julie's choking.

318
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,082
Only one way to save this dance.

319
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,544
Who wants to see Dirty Candy?

320
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,589
Oh!

321
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,132
Oops!

322
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,425
Knob's broken.

323
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,427
Did she just do that?

324
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,636
OK.

325
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,680
Two can play at this game.

326
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,599
Party at my house!

327
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,814
Oh!

328
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,384
Well, that kind of backfired.

329
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,975
Oh, I mean, the whole night wasn't a bust.

330
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,727
The new guy found someone.

331
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,359
Little man has game!

332
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,031
Oh, pizza! Man, I missed you!

333
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,826
Reg, are you kissing that meatball sub?

334
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,371
It's what you do with the things you love.

335
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,373
I take it you're all enjoying the feast?

336
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,457
Yeah!

337
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,085
So many delicious sights,

338
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,087
so many tantalizing sounds.

339
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,046
But...

340
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,341
your eyes still hunger for more.

341
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,218
- Something sweet.
- Yeah!

342
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,596
Something... savory.

343
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,518
How many newcomers
do we have in the club tonight?

344
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,690
Ladies...

345
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,527
let's show our guests how we do dessert.

346
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,946
A one, two, three, four!

347
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,660
Hey!

348
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,704

I'm sorry. Dude!

Dude!

394
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,955
-Dude, we lost track of time...
-Not right now, man.

395
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,708
-Reggie!
-Hey, what the...

396
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,002
We were supposed to be
at Julie's school at 9:00.

397
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,005
Oh shoot. That's right.
Maybe we can still make it.

398
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,174
- Where's Alex? Alex, we forgot...
- Up here.

399
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,759
Julie. I know.

400
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,761
This place is... One sec.

401
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,681
This place is some kind of time warp.

402
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,516
Poof down here, bro. We gotta get going.

403
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,940
Yeah, ah... I can't...

404
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,151
Gentlemen, what's the rush?

405
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,988
The party's just getting started,
and you have an eternity, after all.

406
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,407
You know that girl that can see us?
We sort of bailed on her.

407
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,784
There's this dance at her school,

408
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,827
and her friend Flynn
is a super cool DJ, like--

409
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,871
I don't think he has an eternity
to hear the story.

410
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,331
Basically, we're late for a gig.

411
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,957
But what about my offer?

412
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,919
It's very cool of you, Mr. Covington,
but, like I said, we already have a--

413
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,045
A band of your own.

414
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,630
I understand.

415
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,423
OK.

416
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,343
-OK.
-Oh, boys... if you ever wanna come back

417
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,804
and fix that little problem
with your friend,

418
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,390
the Hollywood Ghost Club is always open.

419
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,433
Yeah, man, we'd love to come back.

420
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,685
Ah! Music to my ears.

421
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,945
Oh, it's just a little club stamp.

422
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:25,946
Cool.

423
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,532
Until next time.

424
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,742
Peace.

425
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,994
See you around.

426
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,164
What? That's what he just did.

427
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,082
Dude.

428
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,837
Um...

429
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,589
Uh, if Willie asks,

430
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,591
uh, not that he would, but if he does,

431
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,136
will you let him know
that I was looking for him?

432
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,973
Thanks.

433
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,312
Um... Caleb?

434
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,899
You never said
you were gonna... use your stamp.

435
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,734
You know what that'll do to them.

436
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,862
Of course I do, William,

437
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,657
but they're too powerful.
I need them working for me.

438
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,660
Now they'll have no option
but to accept my invitation.

439
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,008
I can never show my face
at this school again.

440
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,927
That's what we get
for depending on boys.

441
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,806
I don't know
if I should be mad or worried.

442
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,893
They're ghosts. I don't know
what kind of trouble they can get into.

443
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,312
I'mma get us some ice cream
from the cafeteria.

444
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,938
Fools gave me the keys.

445
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,527
We can crash at my place
and forget about this whole nightmare.

446
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,075
Get me two... of everything.

447
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,705
Julie, we are ready to rock this dance,

448
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,582
which is clearly over.

449
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,464
Look,

450
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,257
we are... so,

451
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,426
so sorry that we bailed on you.

452
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,762
Yeah, I mean,
the night really got away from us.

453
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,888
And the twins.

454
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:19,351
Just please tell me it had nothing to do
with you getting back at Carrie's dad.

455
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,310
Pfft!

456
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,479
-Oh, of course not.
-No! We wouldn't do that.

457
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,855
-Us? No.
-No.

458
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,565
Seriously?

459
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,608
You're lying to me?

460
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,696
OK, look,
it was something we needed to do.

461
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,159
B-But we'll do whatever it takes.

462
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,744
-We'll play the next school--
-What?

463
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,248
Another dance where you can bail on me
and make me look like a fool?

464
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,667
Save it.

465
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,794
You know what really sucks?

466
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,170
Our songs were good.

467
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,507
And all three of you knew
what I've been through,

468
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,426
and how tough it's been for me to play,
and then you do this?

469
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,973
Bands don't do that to each other.

470
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,101
Friends don't do that to each other.

471
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,895
This was a mistake.

472
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,064
You mean the school dance, right?

473
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:06,982
No.

474
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,818
I mean joining a band with you guys.

475
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,613
Julie...

476
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,240
Julie!

477
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,243
Well, if...

478
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,495
if Julie's not in the band, then...

479
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,830
There is no band.

480
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,043
What was that?

481
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,796
It felt like we were dying all over again.

482
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,424
