1
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,945
Oh, dude, why'd you stop me?
Julie needs a hug.

2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,781
Bro, a ghost hug isn't
the feel-good moment

3
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,116
that you think it is. All right?

4
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,910
Trust me. What Julie needs right now
is just a bit of privacy.

5
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,537
You know what? I think you poofed us out

6
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,622
because you can't handle
when people cry.

7
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,665
I should know.

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,209
I cried in a room for 25 years,

9
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,712
and I didn't get a single hug
from either of you.

10
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,339
-All right. Bring it in.
-Don't touch me!

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,467
This is why no one hugs you.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,010
OK.

13
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,054
I think the first thing we should do,

14
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,015
once we get the courage
to go in there, is ask Julie...

15
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,975
why she lied about playing the piano.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,020
Yeah, you know,
maybe tell her how amazing she is.

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,688
-Yeah, course, bro.
-OK.

18
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,357
She's legit. I got ghost bumps.

19
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,989
Oh my gosh. Was she crying too?

20
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,324
Yes!

21
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,994
And the only thing scarier
than one girl crying is two girls crying.

22
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,663
-He's right.
-Guys, we definitely can't go in there.

23
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,540
But we can listen.

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,548
Carlos told me you'd be out here.

25
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,050
We need to talk.

26
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,927
Are you OK?

27
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,640
No, I'm not OK!
You just got kicked out of music!

28
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,309
I've been up all night
thinking about what I was gonna say.

29
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,105
Might've drank seven sodas,
but... I need to get this out.

30
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,941
-Wait. I have something to tell you--
-No, it's my turn to talk.

31
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,235
You can't give up music.

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,987
Your music's like a gift,
that would be a tragedy.

33
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,658
So, you're basically, like,
canceling Christmas, and I love Christmas!

34
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,992
-Flynn, I--
-Uh-uh!

35
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,580
When we were six, we promised
to be in a band together. Double Trouble.

36
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,332
I never agreed to that name.

37
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,210
That's not the point.

38
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,214
Jules, if you leave the music program,
we'll be apart forever.

39
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,966
That's just what happens.

40
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,468
Sure we'll see each other
in the hall sometime, but...

41
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,680
we'll have different lives,
make new friends.

42
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,056
That's not true.

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,059
You're right.
I won't be making any new friends.

44
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,686
The only time we'll contact each other

45
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,397
is when we'll be liking each other's posts
on Instagram.

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,732
Every time
I'll be hitting that little heart,

47
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,735
my heart will be breaking
because my best friend left me, and...

48
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,279
Do you have any soda? My head hurts.

49
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,655
Can I talk now?

50
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,574
Fine.

51
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,577
I just played the piano and sang again.

52
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,288
What? Why didn't you just say so?

53
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,748
I was trying,
then your seven sodas kicked in.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,543
I'm so happy for you!

55
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,586
And me!

56
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,342
Look at you, looking all,
I don't know, alive again.

57
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,053
Right? It's like I drank seven sodas.

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,723
What made you play again?

59
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
I found this song my mom wrote me.

60
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:10,982
Whoa.

61
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,152
I know.

62
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,155
I was so afraid to play it.

63
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,700
Anything involving music
reminds me of her.

64
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,870
And then I woke up this morning...

65
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,581
realizing that's why I should play it.

66
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,875
To keep her memory alive.

67
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,045
Aw! Come here.

68
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,758
We need to tell Mrs. Harrison
you can play so you can stay in school

69
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,636
and my life won't be that sad picture
I just painted for you.

70
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,681
My girl's back.
Double Trouble lives again!

71
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,058
Not our band name.

72
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,019
I gave you a T-shirt in the 7th grade
that says otherwise.

73
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,062
Oops!

74
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,024
Oh hey!

75
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,904
Let's hustle!

76
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,369
Don't worry! We weren't listening.

77
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,372
Oh. Uh...

78
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,041
Oh.

79
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,292
Let's go!

80
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,589
I wonder why Julie didn't tell us
she could shred on the piano?

81
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,716
And sing. That girl can sing.

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,511
It probably has something to do
with her mom. You know?

83
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,512
Must've been hard.

84
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,058
Anyway, I really feel for her.

85
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,434
Yeah, but...

86
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,312
now she's got music back in her life,
just like us.

87
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,191
Yeah, I'm not sure
you can call what we have a life.

88
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,405
Oh hey, some of the clothes
we left behind are still up here.

89
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,033
Sweet.

90
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,205
Oh, same clothes since '95, boys.

91
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,220
Oh, that was weird!

92
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,558
But somehow I can tell
this man has a kind heart.

93
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,311
So, how've ya been?

94
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,482
Honestly, not that good.

95
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,484
See, we ate these hot dogs, and--

96
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,778
Julie sang for the first time
this morning.

97
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,281
Ah!

98
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,784
She hadn't done that in almost a year.
You would've loved it.

99
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,619
Yeah, we saw 'cause we were...

100
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,079
Oh!

101
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,664
Oh, I get it.

102
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,334
He... He's not talking to us.

103
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,794
You are so lucky you can play bass.

104
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,422
Pretty sure he's talking to Julie's mom.

105
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,466
She's such an amazing young woman.

106
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,929
Every day she reminds me
more and more of you.

107
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,930
Called it.

108
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,682
Oh, I'm, uh...

109
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,602
I'm taking pictures
for the real estate website.

110
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,647
I don't really wanna move, but...

111
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,652
I guess it's best for Julie.

112
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,737
Move?

113
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,410
There's so many memories

114
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,330
of Julie playing next to you, and...

115
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:17,668
...Carlos trying to sing
with his missing two front teeth.

116
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,840
Oh no, Luke, not you too.

117
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,807
He... He's talking about moving,
but the poor guy, he doesn't wanna move.

118
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,687
It's like they grew up...

119
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,356
out here.

120
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,275
Oh man, now's he's got me too.

121
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,945
OK, how am I the emotional one?

122
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,323
C-C-Can we go see my family
and see how they're doing?

123
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,241
Yeah.

124
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,494
Yeah, listening to this feels... wrong.

125
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,372
Hey, do you remember
when the kids were at your sister's,

126
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,833
and we came out here on our anniversary...

127
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,002
Yeah. No, definitely wrong.

128
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,046
Ooh! Yep.

129
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,344
Believe me,

130
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,513
I think it's wonderful
that you sang again.

131
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,141
I prayed for this moment
for almost a year.

132
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,309
But it's too late.

133
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,145
What if you just hear her play?

134
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,563
You know she's amazing.

135
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,607
It wouldn't matter.
A new student starts tomorrow.

136
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,279
- There's only--
- So many spots,

137
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,907
and if I don't participate, I'm out.
I know.

138
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,495
I did everything I could
to keep you here this year,

139
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,708
but Principal Lessa was very clear
that yesterday was your last chance.

140
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,877
You'll have to reapply next semester.

141
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,007
I'm truly sorry.

142
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,931
Hand these out, please.

143
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,727
Go, go, go! To me!

144
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,105
- Come on!
- Pass it up!

145
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,608
A bike shack
right where my house used to be.

146
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,026
Right here.

147
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,777
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

148
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,322
They made the Meyersons' house
into a noodle shop.

149
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,533
Why couldn't they have made mine
a pizzeria or something?

150
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,328
They tore down the whole neighborhood.

151
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,663
I guess my folks are gone.

152
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,915
No. Everyone's gone.

153
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,375
Twenty-five years, gone.

154
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,252
Friends, family,

155
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,962
Bobby, everyone.

156
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,130
Bobby, that's right.

157
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,967
I guess that vegetarian lucked out.
What do you think happened to him?

158
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,470
He probably just got old
like everybody else and moved on.

159
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,847
Dude, how are you so casual
about all of this?

160
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,684
-Don't you wanna figure out what happened?
-Let's be real for a second.

161
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,937
It's not like we were that close
to our families.

162
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,147
My folks always regretted
buying me that guitar.

163
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,275
Reggie, your parents were literally
a fight away from a divorce.

164
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,568
Alex, I...

165
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,446
Your parents were never cool again
after you told them you were gay.

166
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,823
OK. None of us had it great.

167
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,620
All right? But at least we had something.
You know, what do we have now?

168
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,373
And before you say
cool teleportation skills,

169
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,626
just know
I'm not entirely OK with that either.

170
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,294
All right? It tingles.

171
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,422
In weird places.

172
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,010
I'll tell you what we had.

173
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,431
It's what we've had
since the day we came together.

174
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,518
Boys, we have us.

175
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,562
We're the only family
we're ever gonna need.

176
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,149
-You know what else we have?
-I'm gonna guess death breath.

177
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,444
Our music, you dork.

178
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,196
We have our music, you guys.

179
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,865
People, actual people, can hear us play!

180
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,994
They can't see us, fine,
but they can feel us.

181
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,914
If I had my guitar,
I'd play for all these people right now.

182
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,083
Just like what we used to do
down at the pier.

183
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,002
They can't tip what they can't see.

184
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,130
It's not about the tips, Alex.

185
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,174
It's about playing music.

186
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,969
Connecting with people.
Making a difference in their day.

187
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,306
I just... I wish I had my guitar.

188
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,225
Whoa!

189
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,686
-That was rad. How'd you do that?
-I don't know.

190
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,897
I-I-I mean, I wished for it,
and then it came in my hands...

191
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,441
I-I-I wish I had a puppy.

192
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,569
-A hamster?
-OK.

193
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,903
Pizza?

194
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,994
Hey, I think I know something
that'll cheer you up.

195
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,214

- Uh...
- Um...

228
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,023
We were looking for the kitchen?

229
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,652
This... This can't happen. It's creepy.

230
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,987
Get off my bed, please.

231
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,197
Hey, Julie.

232
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,992
-What's in the box?
-That's off-limits.

233
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,452
Oh. Oh, OK.

234
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,995
Girl stuff.

235
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,749
-Oh, like butterflies and glitter?
-Oh, come on.

236
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,041
I'm sorry about them.

237
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,918
It's none of your business.

238
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,045
And yes, there might be some glitter.

239
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,592
Hey!

240
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,260
I actually picked something up.

241
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,888
I dropped it.

242
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,683
-Is that your mom?
-Yes, and it's my favorite picture of us.

243
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,310
You break it, I'll break you.

244
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,481
OK, well, sorry because we're kind of
unbreakable at this point.

245
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,857
I don't get it.

246
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,234
You guys can mess up my bed,
pick up your instruments,

247
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,819
but you can't pick up other stuff?

248
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,945
I know, right? It's hard.

249
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,406
But for some reason,
our instruments, easy.

250
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,741
Yeah, like super easy.

251
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,951
Oh, and check out what I learned today.

252
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,495
Ah!

253
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,663
Yeah, that looked super easy.

254
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,793
It's like I always thought,
our instruments are attached to our souls.

255
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,878
Hey.

256
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,798
Everything OK?

257
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,049
Yeah.

258
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,092
- I'm fine.
- OK.

259
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,304
-I thought I heard you talking to someone.
-Nope.

260
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,433
Must've been my laptop...
that I just closed.

261
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,477
OK.

262
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,896
If you need anything...

263
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,274
Yeah. Thanks.

264
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,699
Your dad seems like the kind of guy
who likes to barbecue.

265
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,701
I bet he has a great ribs recipe.

266
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,787
I don't know.
But if you guys wanna talk to me,

267
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,040
we have to do it in the studio.
He's worried about me enough as it is.

268
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,543
He seems chill.
You should just tell him about us.

269
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,710
You're kidding, right?

270
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,675
This past year,
everyone's been watching over me,

271
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,344
being super nice,
as if they're waiting for me to snap.

272
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,888
If I tell my dad I met a ghost band,

273
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,474
I'll be back to talking to Dr. Turner
three days a week.

274
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,018
You probably shouldn't tell him.

275
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,187
-Julie...
-Oh my gosh!

276
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,689
I told you to leave that alone!

277
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,440
I know.
You just shouldn't have said nothing

278
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,860
'cause now
I can't stop thinking about it, so...

279
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,528
What's in the box, Julie?

280
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,321
It's just my dream box, OK?

281
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,617
Whenever I get a thought,
I write it down and get it out of my mind.

282
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,035
Like lyrics?

283
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,665
They would be if I still wrote music
like I used to with my mom.

284
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,585
Now it's just full of stuff
that doesn't make me sad.

285
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,464
But, I mean, you do play.
We heard you this morning.

286
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,716
In the garage?

287
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,385
So you were there too?

288
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,554
-Uh... I don't...
-Uh... He was, like...

289
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,805
-We were...
-Somewhere.

290
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,474
So, where is your kitchen, by the way?

291
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,394
OK, we need to set some boundaries.

292
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,896
For starters,

293
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,689
stay out of my room!

294
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,983
-Mm-hmm. Crystal clear. Let's go.
-We're leaving.

295
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,152
Yes, ma'am! We are out of here.

296
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,992
Hey!

297
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,455
Um, sorry. I didn't mean to bother you.
Did you get back into your music program?

298
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,999
No. No, I didn't.

299
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,377
I'm sorry. That really sucks.

300
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,004
Thanks.

301
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,095
Is that it?

302
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,682
Yeah. Yeah.

303
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,352
This is getting weird.

304
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,563
OK.

305
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,737
Hey, Dad.

306
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,322
What'cha working on?

307
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:52,743
Well, now that the house is on the market,
we need to add some photos to the website.

308
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,328
Help me pick some good ones.

309
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,127
- Got this batch right here.
- These are really nice.

310
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,046
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

311
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,089
Thanks.

312
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,718
These didn't turn out, though.
The ones from mom's studio.

313
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,803
It's like...

314
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,306
little lights and dots all over the place.

315
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,849
Kinda look like orbs, right?

316
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,767
Orbs?

317
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,603
I've seen some freaky stuff
about those on YouTube.

318
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,314
People say they're ghosts.

319
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,193
Do you think that's Mom
and she made some friends?

320
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,989
That's a nice thought,
but there are no such things as ghosts.

321
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,450
Sounds like someone's
spending too much time on the internet.

322
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,494
-You can just trash those.
-All right.

323
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,496
So trash, trash, trash.

324
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,540
Um, Dad?

325
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,749
Yeah?

326
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,376
I was thinking,

327
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,630
if we're just moving 'cause of me,
and you and Carlos wanna stay,

328
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,382
-I'm fine with that.
-I vote we stay!

329
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,343
I don't wanna have to clean under my bed.

330
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,678
Noted.

331
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,973
What made you have second thoughts?

332
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,182
I don't know.

333
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,852
I guess a combination of things.

334
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,481
I know that tía says
that moving is moving on,

335
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,775
but I don't think that's the answer.

336
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,820
I totally agree with you on that.
I mean, I think...

337
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,407
I think moving on
has to come from the inside.

338
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,369
And one of us took a huge step
this morning.

339
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,416
All our memories of Mom are here,
and we should be too.

340
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,585
Can we stay?

341
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,714
All votes are in.

342
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,675
Yes! Yes. Yes! Thank you.

343
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,635
-I love you, Dad.
-Get in here. Come on.

344
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,889
Mm! Big tight group hug.

345
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,225
OK.
Somebody help me find my phone.

346
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,227
I need to call the real estate agent.

347
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,480
Oh, um, I think I saw it in the kitchen.

348
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,439
Kitchen.

349
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
Ghosts.

350
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,968
Ah!

351
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,179
I'm never gonna get used to that.

352
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,435
Do you guys even eat?

353
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,147
I just wanna see what'cha got.

354
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,903
Hey! You know how long
it took me to open that?

355
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,405
Sorry, I don't believe in wasting power.

356
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,284
Good. Because that's exactly
what I wanted to talk to you about.

357
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,744
Our power usage?

358
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,746
No. The power that you have.

359
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:48,043
Your voice. Your piano playing.
Dude, you're like a human wrecking ball.

360
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
Is this a pep talk?

361
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,090
What I'm saying is
that you have the power to move people.

362
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,675
To knock them off their feet.

363
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,719
There is no way your teachers
wouldn't let you back into school

364
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,263
if they heard you play like that.

365
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,182
I asked her. She said
I have to wait until next semester.

366
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,684
That was your first mistake.

367
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,060
Asking.

368
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,189
Sunset Curve booked gigs by doing.

369
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,151
We went into ambush mode.

370
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,237
We played in front of clubs.
We played in back of clubs.

371
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,905
We even played book clubs.

372
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,574
Book clubs?

373
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,200
Yeah.

374
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,038
We didn't get many gigs out of that one,
but they did have some gnarly snacks.

375
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,252
I'm just saying, don't ask for permission.

376
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,631
Swing that wrecking ball of talent
at your teacher's head,

377
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,384
and smash those stupid rules
right outta their brains.

378
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:41,180
This isn't a club, it's a school,
and your plan sounds violent.

379
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,099
It's a closed door,
and you gotta bust it open.

380
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,980
Sorry. Once I start with the metaphors,
I can't stop.

381
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,773
I learned that in book club.

382
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,318
They're not just gonna let me back in.

383
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,491
If getting back into music
is what you want,

384
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,868
then you gotta go for it.

385
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:08,207
Learn from me. Your tainted hot dog
could be right around the corner.

386
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,965
-I don't even have anything prepared.
-Thought you'd say that.

387
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,717
It's called "Bright."

388
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,720
It's a Sunset Curve song I wrote
that we never got to record.

389
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,140
But it's perfect for your range.
Check out the chorus for a second.

390
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,601
