Luke and I spent the whole weekend
writing songs.

-Come on. You wanna hear some of them?
-Duh!

95
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,925

like when I used to write with Mom.

96
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,096

Luke and I wrote.

103
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,241
Thanks!
I think we have an anthem with this one.

104
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,452
It's something
my mom and I were working on.

105
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,955

111
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,603
And my girl's got a crush,
and his name is Luke.

112
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,189
What? No. Luke's a ghost.

113
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,315
A cute ghost.

114
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,901
With a perfect smile.

115
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,363
Ha! I knew it!
Just remember he's made of air.

116
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,489
Cute air.

117
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,699

118
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,117
You guys have a connection.

119
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,036
Everybody's wondering
when you'll play again.

120
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,163
Play again?
We don't even have anything planned.

121
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,540
Luke and I have just been focused
on writing songs.

122
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,627
Lucky for you, your marketing team
has been way ahead of you.

123
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,420
I don't have a marketing team.

124
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,174
Yes, you do!

125
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,133
And surprise!

126
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,594
You're playing the school dance tonight,
and I'm DJ-ing too.

127
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,014
I posted it all over social media.

128
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,016
You have an excellent marketing team.

129
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,975
No. No.

130
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,186
This is in front of the whole school.

131
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,023
Sorry, you already have 68 likes.

132
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,567
Wait!

133
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,448
We're playing a school dance? Sweet!

134
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,075
It's not exactly the Strip.

135
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,411
And you're not exactly alive,

136
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,287
so you should be happy
we have our first gig.

137
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,415
I wasn't in love with the idea
at first either,

138
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,334
but it could be a great way
for us to build a following, right?

139
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,003
Yeah. Yeah. We need to play
wherever we can, whenever we can.

140
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,422
No, you're right.

141
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,383
Let's rock those kids' faces off
and then play the clubs.

142
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,593
And then record a single
that gets a billion streams?

143
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,471
I don't know what that is, but hopefully
it gets us a manager and a tour.

144
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,348
Then we release a bunch of hit albums.

145
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,143
Put out a country album
that does surprisingly well.

146
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,019
I shred on the banjo, so...

147
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,230
-Then I'll learn how to fiddle.
-And before you know it,

148
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,482
we're being inducted
into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.

149
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,859
But one of us isn't there.

150
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,902
Because we had a blowout in 2032.

151
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,112
My money's on Alex.

152
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,197
- He's so sensitive.
- What are we waiting for?

153
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,908
-Let's get rehearsing!
-Uh... Where is Alex?

154
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,082
You know what?
I don't think this is about the art.

155
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,501
I think you just like breaking the rules.

156
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,545
Maybe.

157
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,547
You should try it sometime.

158
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,593
We're going in there, aren't we?

159
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,020
Wow.

160
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,980
Sick, right?

161
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,650
And we got the whole place to ourselves.

162
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,613
Huh! Oh!

163
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,032
Woo-hoo! Ha!

164
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,204
Woo-hoo!

165
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,133
Oh, dude. Move that bench over here.
I'm gonna try to jump it.

166
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,302
Uh... Yeah. I can't move that.

167
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,263
I can barely move small things.

168
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,060
Dude, trust me.

169
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,730
If you focus on putting all your energy
into your hands,

170
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,315
you can move anything.

171
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:46,901
OK.

172
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,238
All right.

173
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,995
No, I guess
I gotta start doing ghost push-ups.

174
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,039
No. You just gotta focus.

175
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,417
Yeah.
I've always had a hard time focusing.

176
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,586
I've always been a little anxious,
and then I died.

177
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,464
Which did not calm me down.

178
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,882
-Right.
-So...

179
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,468
Hey.

180
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,597
We got this.

181
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,600
OK?

182
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,897
Yo, you've got, like, ten seconds

183
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,482
-to get on.
-Yeah, all right!

184
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,069
All right. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
All the way, all the way, all the way.

185
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:31,988
Boom!

186
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,907
Not bad, man.
All right, stay there. Stay there.

187
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,294
Yes!

188
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,504
Oh man!

189
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,923
That felt good.

190
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,430
You're wired a little tight, huh?

191
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,516
OK.

192
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,271
Is that why you started playing drums?
To help you with your... anxiety?

193
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,648
Yeah. I mean, pretty much.

194
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,525
There's no better way
to work out your problems

195
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,444
than wailing on some drums, right?

196
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,364
Hey, do you know
what makes me feel better?

197
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,825
Yelling in...

198
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,619
museums.

199
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,881
-You gotta stand up.
-No.

200
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,799
-You gotta put your heart into it, man.
-OK.

201
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,800
Ready?

202
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,103
Feels good.

203
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,647
Right?

204
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,232
Yeah. It does.

205
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,453
One more time.

206
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,460
-Oh. Hey, Alex.
-Where have you been?

207
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,753
We need to start practicing.

208
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,296
Yeah? For what?

209
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,549
Dance news!

210
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,676
I don't have a date.

211
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,054
But I don't care because I'm so psyched
to see you guys perform.

212
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,972
Oh man! We're playing a dance?

213
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,767
Of course, dude.
That's how we get a following nowadays.

214
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,977
Yeah, get with the program, Alex.

215
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,895
What?

216
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,772
The guys are here?

217
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,690
Hey, guys!

218
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,358
Other way, sweetie.

219
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,818
Oh.

220
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,196
OK, well, now that
Alex has graced us with his presence,

221
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,281
-can we start working?
-Yes! We're gonna rehearse.

222
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,574
You wanna stick around?

223
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,952
I'm supposed to blow up 500 balloons
for the school dance,

224
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,370
but this sounds way better.

225
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,415
Hey, Julie.
Remember those orbs in Dad's pictures?

226
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,208
I... I think they're ghosts.

227
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,919
But don't worry. This room is...

228
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,547
is...

229
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,592
This room is clean.
I'm not getting the ghost tinglies.

230
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,136
Wrong again, little dude.

231
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,931
Have no fear.
If they come back, I will protect you,

232
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,808
because I am the man of the house.

233
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,185
Isn't Dad supposed to be
the man of the house?

234
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,228
There can be two.

235
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,231
Dad needs all the help he can get, right?

236
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,778
According to the internet,
salt burns their souls out.

237
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,742
A little sprinkle will keep them
from ever coming in here.

238
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,955
No!

239
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,165
Oh!

240
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,083
Oh God, I'm...

241
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,003
I'm fine.

242
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,379
I'm fine. Totally fine.

243
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,924
Oh!

244
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,760
Carlos, you know who's hungry?

245
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,969
Me.

246
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,054
Um, salt me a path to the kitchen.

247
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,057
Phew.

248
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,771
-Shall we try this again?
-Yes, please. But remind us later.

249
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,606
There's some Sunset Curve songs
to show you.

250
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,316
Ooh! Show me now.

251
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,609
Yeah, OK.

252
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,571
"Home Is Where My Horse Is?"

253
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,741
Reggie, stop putting your country songs
in my journal.

254
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,659
-That was a gift.
-Thanks, buddy.

255
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,077
You should maybe circle back...

256
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,079
I dog-eared the ones
that I think you would slay.

257
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,961
-Who's Emily?
-That one's not dog-eared.

258
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,217
"If you could only know
that I never let you go."

259
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,303
Wow, Luke,
I didn't know you were such a romantic.

260
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,430
-He's not. That one's actually about--
-No one.

261
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,725
Uh, that's just something
that I tried, and...

262
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,354
But if you go to the next dog-eared page,
I got a tune that's just...

263
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,688
It's got a killer beat.

264
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,114
So you wanna sample.

265
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,952
-What do you mean "sample"?
-Sample someone else's music.

266
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,789
Me and my mom used to sing that song
at the top of our lungs all the time.

267
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,499
It's a classic Trevor Wilson song.

268
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,875
Nope.

269
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,252
It's a classic our song.

270
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,004
Pure Sunset Curve.
Never even heard of Trevor Wilson.

271
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,173
Maybe you're mixing it up,
you know, with another song.

272
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,551
I don't mix up songs. Trust me.

273
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,678
Me and his daughter
used to be best friends.

274
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,722
I used to hang out at their place
all the time. I know that song.

275
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,224
OK.

276
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,475
Here.

277
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,018
I'll prove it.

278
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,402
His first album had a bunch of hits,
but none of his latest stuff is as good.

279
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,904
That's Bobby.

280
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,448
Seriously,
I just told you his name is Trevor.

281
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,826
OK, great. Then...
Then he changed it, all right?

282
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,662
That's definitely Bobby.
He was our rhythm guitarist.

283
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,706
Trevor Wilson was in your band?

284
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,708
I can't get over how old he looks.

285
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,876
Oh...

286
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,211
He looks like a substitute teacher.

287
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,463
Julie...

288
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,092
what were his other hits?

289
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,385
"Get Lost."

290
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,680
Yeah. I wrote that.

291
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,266
-"Long Weekend"?
-Yeah, Luke wrote that one too.

292
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,060
"Crooked Teeth"?

293
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,145
And that.

294
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,479
It was about Reggie.

295
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,356
What? I thought it was about you!

296
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,192
I don't like that song anymore.

297
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,819
Wait.

298
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,280
This is... freaking me out.

299
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,116
Trevor's songs are kind of big to me.

300
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,037
-He's the one who introduced me to rock.
-Yeah. Luke introduced you to rock.

301
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,124
So this whole time,
I thought you were connected to my mom.

302
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,169
But instead,
you're connected to Carrie's dad?

303
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,339
Out of all people, it had to be
the one girl who had it out for me.

304
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,549
All right, well,
add it to our list of questions.

305
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,968
Back when Carrie and I were friends,

306
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,055
the three of us used to talk about music
all the time.

307
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,015
He never mentioned you guys.

308
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,017
And that's unbelievable!

309
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,604
OK, he can take all the credit,
and he doesn't even mention us?

310
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,190
And he's rich.

311
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,317
He has his own helicopter.

312
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,988
He has... He has a... a helicopter?

313
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,323
With his face on it.

314
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,033
And he parks it in front of that hotel?

315
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,494
No. He gets to park it
in front of his mansion.

316
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,205
-Mansion?
-Dude, we live in a garage.

317
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,749
It's not about the money.
It's about the music!

318
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,627
-It's a little bit about the money though!
-A little bit about the money.

319
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,337
He could have shared it with our families.

320
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,382
Maybe then my parents wouldn't have had
their house turned into a bike shack.

321
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,801
What he did is steal our legacy.

322
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,098
Where does he live?

323
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,601
Above the beach in Malibu.

324
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,523
-Let's go teach him a lesson.
-Wait. What? Guys!

325
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,442
We have to rehearse for the dance.
This is our first gig!

326
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,237
OK, boys.

327
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,489
Break time's over, OK?

328
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,949
Get to playing.

329
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,659
Mama needs her eye candy.

330
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,743
They're gone.

331
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,747
I think I just unleashed
three angry ghosts on the world.

332
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,417
But I think I know where they're going.

333
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,960
Come on.

334
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,315
Bobby's house is ridiculous.

335
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,485
-Have you seen these platinum records?
-Platinum?

336
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,532
He recorded "My Name Is Luke!"

337
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,369
My name is Luke!

338
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,498
It's him!

339
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,710
Hey, Carrie. I'm gonna meditate.

340
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,336
He wears sunglasses indoors.

341
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,629
I'm in the den!

342
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,630
Cool!

343
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,758
I can't stand him.

344
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,218
-Time for his past to haunt him.
-Yep.

345
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,637
Wait!

346
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,851
Let's not rush this. You know, it's my...
It's my first time haunting someone.

347
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,563
I wanna make it special.

348
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,149
OK, Alex.

349
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,611
That was weird. OK.

350
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,530
Ow! Jeez!

351
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,911
- Come on.
- OK.

352
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,497
Ow!

353
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,082
Don't stop. Go. Keep on going.

354
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,333
Just go. Go, go, go...

355
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,552
-Hey!
-Hey!

356
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,223
What are you two doing here?
How'd you get over the security gate?

357
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,599
Teamwork!

358
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,060
Do you have a Band-Aid?
The barbed wire's new.

359
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,520
What do you want?

360
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,022
Uh... Just thought you should know

361
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,274
that Julie's band is playing
at the dance tonight.

362
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,318
Now you know.

363
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,570
You guys are acting weirder than usual.

364
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,489
-Probably because we're thirsty.
-Yeah.

365
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,741
Can we come in for a glass of water?

366
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,742
Ugh!

367
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,328
Fine, if it'll make you leave faster.

368
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,125
Don't break anything.

369
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,589
Careful!

370
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,893
Where are you?

371
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,271
I'm... I'm right here.

372
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,862
Nick! Look, Flynn, it's Nick.

373
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,865
Nickster, Nicky-poo, Nick-a-licious.

374
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,283
Make it stop.

375
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,912
Hey! Glad you're here, Nicky-poo.

376
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,165
We wanted to tell you

377
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,834
that Julie's band is playing at the dance.

378
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,170
Oh yeah. No. I... I saw your post.

379
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,256
These girls bothering you, babe?

380
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,675
No, just telling us
about the dance tonight.

381
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:41,180
Right. Julie and her hologram band
are playing.

382
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,016
How'd you learn how to do
all that hologram stuff anyways?

383
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,477
The internet.
It's not just full of makeup tips.

384
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,024
Uh... What do... What do you say, babe?

385
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,526
Sure.

386
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,779
Let's check out the hologram show.

387
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,032
Great. Um... I'll make sure
all my buddies are there.

388
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,701
Ooh! How exciting.

389
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,786
That's a lot of people staring at you.

390
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,249
You girls remember
where the door is, right?

391
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,001
Yeah.

392
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,879
Oh my gosh.

393
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,714
I am so sorry! No, no, no, no.

394
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,258
I know where the towels are.

395
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,093
I'll get it.

396
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,345
She knows.

397
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,721
Oh...

398
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,598
Here I go.

399
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,351
Oh my gosh. Can you imagine
if this was cranberry juice?

400
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,354
I don't know about you,
but I've been a klutz my entire life.

401
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,481
Guys!

402
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,067
For your sake, you better not be up here.

403
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:50,499
Ohm...

404
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,833
Ew!

405
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,502
Ugh!

406
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,434
Ohm...

407
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,416
Carrie?

408
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,335
I got it.

409
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,130
Let... me... out!

410
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,176
Shh, shh, shh.

411
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,139
Hoo!

412
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:34,144
No, no, no, no, no...
Trevor, nothing Dr. Crystal can't handle.

413
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,731
I'm gonna see my therapist, OK? OK.

414
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,567
Oh my God.

415
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,284
Quick! Let's moon him
before he gets too far away.

416
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,577
He can't see us.

417
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,746
Oh, it's not for him, bro. It's for us.

418
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,167
Whew! Take that, Bobby!

419
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,587
What is a raccoon doing in my backyard?

420
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,173
You guys want to...

421
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,509
see a photo of that?

422
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,261
- Oh!
- It's just so cute!

423
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,429
Look at it.

424
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,682
So, did you guys have fun in there?

425
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,644
OK, you'd do the exact same
if he stole all your songs.

426
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,979
But you have new songs. With me.

427
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,983
The best way to get back at Trevor
is for this band to do great.

428
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,861
And to do great,
we have to play at dances, then clubs.

429
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,030
And tours. I know.

430
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,449
I'll see you guys at the school.

431
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,992
We go on at 9:00.

432
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,829
Please don't be late.
There's gonna be a lot of people there.

433
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,455
We got it, all right? Don't worry.

434
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,253
I don't care what Julie says.
I'm glad we scared Bobby.

435
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,256
Wish we'd done more, like...
like written "thief" on his forehead.

436
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,717
And, Alex, how did you shut the door?
You could barely open a garage door.

437
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,469
Learned that from Willie, didn't you?

438
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:53,056
Yeah. Well, he taught me some things,
and we screamed in a museum.

439
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,600
It's a long story.

440
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,145
You think he has
a few more tricks up his sleeve?

441
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,187
Let's find out.

442
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,150
Hey! Good day, officers.

443
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,237
Hey!

444
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,739
What's up, man? You brought friends.

445
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,867
Yeah. These are my bandmates,
uh, Luke and Reggie.

446
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,493
-Hey.
-Cool. I'm Willie.

447
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,162
Heck yeah.

448
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,248
So... you guys here
to learn some "tricks?"

449
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,587
Hey, what's going on?
Look at that.

450
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,635
Do it again! Do it again!

451
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,596
Actually,
we were thinking a little bigger.

452
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,016
An old bandmate stole from us.
We wanna confront him face-to-face.

453
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,352
All right.
Is this, uh, old friend of yours a lifer?

454
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,105
Oh, that's fancy ghost lingo
for the living.

455
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,982
Little something I picked up.

456
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,442
Ah! Then, yeah!

457
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,526
He's a lifer.

458
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,196
Too much of a fancy-pants for street dogs.

459
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,031
Yeah, I'm sorry.

460
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,283
Speaking to lifers
is even out of my league.

461
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,457
You know, but there is one ghost
who might be able to help you guys.

462
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,000
He's kind of a big deal.

463
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,793
Literally, anything would help.

464
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,588
Oh, all right. Well, um,
I gotta go take care of some things,

465
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,382
but I'll meet you where Alex and I met,
eight o'clock.

466
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,800
See ya.

467
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,435
Woo-hoo!

468
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,854
Yeah!

469
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,525
Do we have any Bobcats in the house?

470
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,405
Everybody make some noise!

471
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,617
OK, OK, OK. Not too much noise.

472
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,702

How come we've never heard of it?

492
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,229
That's because this area
has been sealed off for decades.
