1
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,477
And right. And left.

2
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:20,895
Step, touch.

3
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,731
Step, touch. Step, tou--

4
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,650
Oh, Julie, how nice of you to join us.

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,069
I'm so sorry. I overslept.

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,529
Take your spot.

7
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,995
So, why didn't you wake me up?
I missed my first three classes.

8
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,413
- Good reach.
- You said

9
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,082
you were never gonna
show your face at school again.

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,751
And I'm a very literal person.

11
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,335
- Breathe out.
- It's OK.

12
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,005
It's those stupid ghosts
that I'm really upset at.

13
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,466
I'd kill them
if they weren't already dead.

14
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,719
Having a band is supposed to help
your social life, not ruin it.

15
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,137
Ex-band.

16
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,306
Right. Sorry.

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,682
Ex-band.

18
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,976
- Get down to the leg.
- It's all so messed up.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,605
I thought they were in this with me.
But obviously, I was wrong.

20
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,899
Hey, don't blame yourself.

21
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,734
You can only be so strong

22
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,111
when three cute ghosts ask you
to join a band.

23
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,156
And speaking of cute,
have you talked to Nick today?

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,657
He was pretty chatty at the dance.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,368
No, and I'm kinda dreading it.

26
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,704
At least I know
I won't see him in this class.

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,207
Wha...

28
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,376
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What?

29
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,712
What are they doing here?

30
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,714
Right on time, Coach Barron.

31
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,761
So, students,
Coach Barron and I have decided

32
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,139
that his lacrosse team will be part
of our class for a few weeks.

33
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,766
Many pro athletes have used dance

34
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,060
to help them with coordination
and mobility.

35
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,479
This isn't about flirting with girls.

36
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,440
It's about making us better
so we can actually win a game.

37
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,609
We lost against Burbank.

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,236
Burbank!

39
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,615
Well, let's all remember
that composure is a big part of dance.

40
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,160
- Everybody pair up.
- Right.

41
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,830
Let's go!

42
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,666
-No, no!
-Come on, Flynn.

43
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,167
-I'm sorry.
-Don't leave me.

44
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,252
Please.

45
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,169
Hey.

46
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,464
Hey, you.

47
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,883
So, ladies,
let's do what we learned last week,

48
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,637
and we will perform this
with the boys this Friday.

49
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,889
Coach Barron and I will demonstrate.

50
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:21,891
No.

51
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,185
I don't dance. So...

52
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,271
- You do now.
- Oh.

53
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,565
And jump out, and bounce,

54
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,358
and snake.

55
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,985
Reach up...

56
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,196
and turn around.

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,948
Boys, jump out.

58
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,994
Let's do it again. Half-time, no music.

59
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,370
You ready for this?

60
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,830
Sure. Uh...

61
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,667
My little sister throws
a lot of princess dance parties.

62
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,588
Five, six, seven, eight.

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,841
Nice.

64
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,176
Not so bad, Your Majesty.

65
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,635
Thank you.

66
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,761
And torso.

67
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,015
So, about last night's dance.

68
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,852
Yeah. I was kind of hoping
that if I didn't talk about it,

69
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,104
it'd be like it never happened.

70
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,481
You'll be fine, OK? You're tough.

71
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,442
You've been through way worse.

72
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,110
Uh...

73
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,111
Breathe.

74
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,362
Whoa. Um...

75
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,280
Sorry. I...

76
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,865
Really good. Once more.

77
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,783
With music.

78
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,328
I'm just...
I'm not used to dancing like this.

79
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,580
You and Carrie never dance together?

80
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,124
No, and we never will.

81
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,209
We broke up.

82
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,628
Oh... You did?

83
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,380
I'm...

84
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,882
...done with the drama.

85
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:40,303
And I don't know if you noticed,
but she's not the nicest person.

86
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,930
What?

87
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,431
I never noticed.

88
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,728
Uh...

89
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,106
You sure you wanna be partners?

90
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,108
No. I... I want you.

91
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,696
To be my dance partner!

92
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,074
Let's just... go over it again.

93
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,742
We'll get it eventually.

94
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,166
Oh, great angle. Yeah.

95
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,086
Now that's a good pic.

96
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,214
Is this what we're here for?
To watch people take pictures of food?

97
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,676
It's fun. Watch this.
People never stop looking at their phones.

98
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,052
Oop! Ehh!

99
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,304
Whoop.

100
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,521
Luke said something about this place being
a hot spot for music industry people.

101
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,231
Yes!

102
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,365
Boys, being a ghost
definitely has its privileges.

103
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,201
I just wrote our names
on the playlist for tonight.

104
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,414
I'm getting a little worried about him.
He keeps forgetting Julie quit the band.

105
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,750
She's gonna come back
as soon as she knows we have a great gig.

106
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,545
But if she doesn't come back,
let's not forget,

107
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,007
we do have somewhere else
we can play and eat pizza.

108
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,760
Dude, I know. It was awesome to be seen
by lifers at Caleb's party, but...

109
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,513
but we got this with Julie.
We don't need him.

110
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,851
Oh! It's the same thing again!

111
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,227
Just like yesterday!

112
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,980
It feels like that time
I was fixing my amp in the rain.

113
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,440
You shouldn't...

114
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,568
OK. Look, do you think
something's wrong with us?

115
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,071
Yeah. Yeah, we ate ten pounds
of pizza yesterday without a stomach.

116
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,574
I'm sure it's just our bodies
working through it.

117
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,951
So we're just gonna forget
about getting back at Trevor?

118
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,995
That jerk stole our music.

119
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,830
And he has to live with that guilt.

120
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,459
It's just like what Julie said.
We have a new band, a new sound, OK?

121
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,419
That's what we should be focusing on.

122
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,545
Isn't that Willie?

123
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,638
Well, someone's not focusing on our music.

124
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,695
Hello, William.

125
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,864
Caleb, hi. Um...

126
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,282
I... I was actually just--

127
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
Checking on the boys for me?

128
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,244
How is my band doing?

129
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,082
Uh... Well, they're flickering.
Just like you wanted them to.

130
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,583
Wonderful.

131
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,211
Oh, and William,

132
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,799
the next time you want
to check on the boys for me,

133
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,635
let me know.

134
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,388
Yeah, my bad.

135
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,890
You do love skating the streets
of Hollywood.

136
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,434
Would hate
to have to take that away from you.

137
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,030
♪ We're sorry♪

138
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,323
♪ So sorry♪

139
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,242
♪ We're super-duper, crazy, stupid♪

140
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,660
♪ Sorry ♪

141
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,121
In case you missed it, we're really sorry.

142
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,914
Yeah. I... I got that part.

143
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,083
We've been here for, like, three hours.

144
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,167
Yup.

145
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,877
We almost sang to your little brother.

146
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,547
He comes in here a lot.
Mainly to use the bathroom.

147
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,799
Yeah.
It's not our favorite part of the day.

148
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,385
But, Julie, it wasn't OK
that we flaked on the dance last night.

149
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,678
We know we let you down.

150
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,013
Yeah, and none of us wanted
to disappoint you.

151
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,350
You're the best thing that's happened
to us since we became ghosts.

152
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,437
So, in hopes that you'll rejoin the band,

153
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,605
we booked a new gig.

154
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,649
A mega important, life-changing gig.

155
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,737
Oh, OK. Check it out. Tons of managers
go here to listen to new bands.

156
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,116
All we gotta do is blow them all away,
and we're living the dream.

157
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,493
So this means a lot to you, huh?

158
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,373
Kind of how playing in front of my whole
entire school meant a lot to me.

159
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,000
Sounds like sarcasm.

160
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,752
I'm starting to think
our plan isn't working.

161
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,380
Look, we know we messed up.

162
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,966
But we need you in the band.

163
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,551
Of course you do,

164
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,596
because without me,
no one can see you guys playing.

165
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,516
You know, I thought that the music
that we were writing was special,

166
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,853
but you're too obsessed with your past
to even care.

167
00:07:58,936 --> 00:07:59,896
I do care.

168
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,356
Our band has a real chance at greatness.

169
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,692
I'm not gonna let
that get away from us again.

170
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,987
Uh-huh. Right. So then why did you bail
on me to get back at Trevor?

171
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,822
I'll tell you why.

172
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,659
'Cause there's only one thing
you care about, and that's yourself.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,376
Dude, she didn't mean it.

174
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,172
Where's he going?

175
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007
Where do you think?

176
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,134
Remember what today is?

177
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,896
Hey, you, uh... you got a second?

178
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,861
Oh my gosh. She can't see us anymore!

179
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,574
Oh. Right.

180
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:54,909
Yep.

181
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,038
Julie, please.

182
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,667
I already told you
that I'm done with the band.

183
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,168
Yeah, we know, all right?

184
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,504
But before you decide that forever,
we just...

185
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,758
We wanted you to know
that Luke isn't as selfish as you think.

186
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,552
Yeah, you've got him all wrong.

187
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,141
You remember that song "Emily"?

188
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,104
Can we at least show you
who that's actually about?

189
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,619
So, Emily's his mom?

190
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,538
Yeah.

191
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,374
Yeah, Luke comes here a lot.

192
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,418
He thinks we don't know, but...

193
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,587
we've been following him.

194
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,466
All he does is just hang out like this
and watch them.

195
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,261
They never really do anything though.

196
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,937
They're having cake.

197
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,731
That's something.

198
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,318
It's a... It's a birthday cake.

199
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,028
For Luke.

200
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,284
I never knew Luke was hurting this much.

201
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,369
Yeah.

202
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,040
It's even worse because when he died,
he... left on bad terms.

203
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,170
You know, his parents didn't want
their 17-year-old in a rock band, so...

204
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,631
he just left.

205
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,551
He never got the chance
to make up with them.

206
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,398
That's why Luke was so angry.

207
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,778
If Trevor had given Luke credit
for writing all the songs, then...

208
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,490
...his parents would've known
his dream was worth chasing.

209
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,619
They would have been so proud.

210
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,657
We know how bad it hurts whenever
someone that should've had your back...

211
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,992
completely lets you down.

212
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,623
We never meant to make you feel that way.

213
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,710
Julie, we love our band,

214
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,920
and Luke does too.

215
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,091

Grab your guitar. We got work to do.

221
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,837
What made you come back?

222
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,966
I realized how important music is
to all of us.

223
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,719
And we've lost so much already.

224
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,763
We can't lose this too.

225
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:45,931

Oh, and by the way, happy birthday.

228
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,739
Let's go from the pre-chorus.

What are you doing?

234
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,006
Looking for those orb things.

235
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,592
I'm telling you, this place is haunted.

236
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,805
Every time I open my laptop,
it's on some... rock music site.

237
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,599
That ain't me.
You know I'm all about the rap.

238
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,434
Reggie.

239
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,019
I'm just trying to protect you.

240
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,022
Oh, I'd be careful in there.

241
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,857
Dad has that look on his face

242
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,902
like when Google Maps tells him
to turn on the wrong street.

243
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,497
Care to tell me why you missed
the first three classes today?

244
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,875
I overslept at Flynn's house
after the dance.

245
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,503
There was nothing going on
in those classes anyways.

246
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,422
It won't happen again.

247
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,507
I promise.

248
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,056
OK.

249
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,809
But if I know you missed class,

250
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,436
it's only a matter of time before...

251
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,148
I came as fast as I could.

252
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,692
Exactly.

253
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,696
Julie, I will not let you fall
into the gutter of life.

254
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,616
Tía, I'm fine. I just overslept.
And me and Dad already talked about it.

255
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,620
You are far from fine, sobrina.

256
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,330
I called your teacher.

257
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,457
She said you missed a calculus test.

258
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,877
Nothing going on, huh?

259
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,588
Dad, I'm so sorry.

260
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,549
This is where you punish her.

261
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,552
I know.

262
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,804
Julie...

263
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,181
no more going out on school nights.

264
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,434
But, Dad, tonight...

265
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,063
And go to your room.

266
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,441
What else?

267
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,068
What? And... And read.

268
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,696
Study.

269
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,114
Calculus.

270
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,742
Go!

271
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,410
Now!

272
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,799
You know I'm only here to help, right?

273
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,134
I know.

274
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,721
And sometimes I look a little annoyed...

275
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,807
but I do appreciate you.

276
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,937
You need me to look after Carlos,
don't you?

277
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,688
Just a couple of hours.

278
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,942
Mijo!

279
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,002
Nick!

280
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,805
What are you guys doing?

281
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,724
We're being classy.

282
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,017
Whoa!

283
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,230
Why are you still here?
We're going in, like, 20 minutes.

284
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,819
I lied to my dad,
so... now I'm stuck in my room all night.

285
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:31,281
Yeah, but we were just at the venue.
I mean, it's packed. Like, VIPs, managers.

286
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,491
It's kind of crazy.

287
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,494
What are we gonna do about my aunt?
She's right downstairs.

288
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,871
Your aunt.

289
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,042
You're not taking the stairs.

290
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,799
OK. Let me get dressed.
I'll meet you guys there.

291
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,437
- Next up, Dirty Candy.
- Am I too late?

292
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,354
Too early.

293
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,528
Hope you all came to have a great time.

294
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,451
Dirty Candy? How'd she get on the list?

295
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,119
Her daddy probably made a call.

296
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,414

Mm-hmm.

00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,459
Yeah. You can stop smiling now.

344
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,098
