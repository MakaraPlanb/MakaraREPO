1
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,443
You can't hide forever, ghosties.

2
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,449
Gotcha!

3
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,827
For the last time, mijo.

4
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,163
Ghosts are not real.

5
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,789
Typical adult.

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,542
Remember when we were kids,
and they never believed what we said?

7
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,003
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
that's just a "you" thing.

8
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,421
I was always pretty trustworthy.

9
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,590
Shouldn't we be more worried about Julie?

10
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,384
Her dad just busted her, OK?
He's probably making her quit the band.

11
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,471
Well, there's not much
we can do about that now, but...

12
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,389
we can still help Carlos.

13
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,392
Adults not believing children
ends tonight.

14
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,228
- Showtime.
- I haven't seen them. I--

15
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,233
Ghosts aren't real, huh?
How do you explain that?

16
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,153
Light bulbs burn out all the time, Carlos.

17
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,988
Ooh! Wrong answer, tía.

18
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,866
Explain... this.

19
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,788
Maybe it's my mom.

20
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,291
She knows
I haven't been replacing the toilet paper!

21
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,711
Your mama would never scare us.
This is the work of a demon!

22
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,631
Hey, words hurt.

23
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,633
Wait! I got to get it on video.

24
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,717
Yeah, you do.

25
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,720
Time for an old classic.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,973
Oh!

27
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,476
Dang, it was in selfie mode.

28
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,272
Whew!

29
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,194
Do you have any idea what you've done?

30
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,572
Yeah, I do. I've defended every kid
who's never been believed.

31
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,407
Some might say I'm a superhero.

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,828
We should probably hide
before Julie finds out, huh?

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,421
Julie, we need to talk.

34
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,133
So,

35
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,677
after skipping school, missing a test,

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,389
you decided to sneak out even though
I told you to go to your room and study?

37
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,765
I know.

38
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,017
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, you keep saying that.

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,853
If you'd just...

40
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,438
...let me in,
I could've been excited about tonight

41
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,941
instead of having this conversation
we both hate.

42
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,901
Why didn't you tell me you were in a band?

43
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,070
It all just happened so fast.

44
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,032
These last couple of weeks
have changed my life.

45
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,492
When I play music,

46
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,911
I feel so much closer to mom.

47
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,415
And I love that. You know I do.

48
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,002
But your tía is right.
School needs to come first.

49
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,712
I know, but without the band,

50
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,089
I would've never made it back
into the music program.

51
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,967
They played with me
when I was trying to earn back my spot.

52
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,051
They did?

53
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,930
I think this is my thing, Dad.

54
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,724
Well...

55
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,977
I'd be a jerk of a dad
if I took that away from you.

56
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,438
Look, if you're gonna stay in this band,

57
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,148
you need to keep up with school,

58
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,483
and you need to keep me in the loop.

59
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,152
Really?

60
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,612
Yeah.

61
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,947
Thanks, Papa.

62
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,871
Hey, so that lady at your show, she was,
like, some sort of manager, right?

63
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,206
Could've been a big deal.

64
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,624
Who knows?

65
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,168
Hopefully,
she'll get to see us play again.

66
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,338
-Which I will tell you about.
-Oh. Yeah, you will,

67
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,591
'cause if I ever catch you
trying to sneaking out again,

68
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,051
or if your grades slip,

69
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,802
I'm gonna pull the plug.

70
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,722
Or whatever it is
that makes those holograms work.

71
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,185
Do I ever get to meet these guys?

72
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,188
Probably not. They don't even live here.

73
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,357
It's... kind of confusing.

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,068
But being seen really isn't their thing.

75
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,445
You kids and technology.
It's...

76
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,031
...definitely beyond me.

77
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,991
Definitely beyond something.

78
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,868
Well, whoever and, uh,

79
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,119
wherever they are,

80
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,623
they brought my little niña back,
so as far as I'm concerned,

81
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,041
they're like angels to me.

82
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,753
Whoa...

83
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,630
This house is haunted!
We have got to go. Now!

84
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,673
What happened?

85
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,717
Victoria, I know you want us to move,
but this is a little extreme.

86
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,595
-I... I told you, we're OK.
-I'll let Carlos explain what happened.

87
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,640
He refuses to leave,
but if movies have taught me anything,

88
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,393
when a house is haunted, you run.

89
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,736
♪ I got a spark in me♪

90
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,780
♪ Hands up if you can see♪

91
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,116
♪ When you're a part of me♪

92
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,201
♪ Hands up if you're with me♪

93
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,037
♪ I got a spark in me, hands up... ♪

94
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,914
-Hands up, yeah.
-This is new.

95
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah. I was in the mood
for cooking some breakfast.

96
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,918
He thought
you were talking to him.

97
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,461
Me and your dad are pals now.

98
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,715
It's a little one-sided, but it works.

99
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,758
Look, after the talk we had
the other night,

100
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,387
I was thinking that I may have cost you
an opportunity with that manager.

101
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:08,182
-So, I was thinking--
-Dad, no. I should've never snuck out.

102
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,686
Let the man speak.
He's been stress eating all week.

103
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,939
I don't know where he puts it though.
It's, like... firm.

104
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,608
I know, but I really want
to support your band,

105
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,572
so I called in some favors,
and I booked you a local gig.

106
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,866
Best dad ever! What?

107
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,368
Oh my gosh. Where?
Did you call your buddy from Drakes?

108
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,786
Not quite.

109
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,040
I called Flynn,
and she's gonna help us throw a party.

110
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,666
Here. Tonight.

111
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,792
Oh!

112
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,545
So you booked us a gig at our house?

113
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,630
Maybe I was early
with the "Best Dad Ever" award.

114
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,757
All right. Hear me out.

115
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,760
You invite some of your friends over,
you play with your band,

116
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,346
and I'll get some colleagues
to put you on film.

117
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,349
That way, you have something professional
for your YouTube.

118
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,642
You'd do that for me?

119
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,602
Yeah.

120
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,439
Back to "best dad ever."
I'll go tell the guys.

121
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,692
Have a good day at work, Ray.

122
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,112
It's cool. You don't have to answer.
Just...

123
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,411
Hello, students and faculty.

124
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,122
Just a friendly reminder,
tickets are still available

125
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,541
for the marching band practice
this weekend.

126
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,251
All-you-can-eat pancakes...

127
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,294
Hey.

128
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,799
Normal people don't do that.
And ghosts definitely shouldn't.

129
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,342
What are you doing here?

130
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,719
We need to talk about
what song we're gonna play tonight.

131
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,888
I was thinking... "Great."

132
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,848
Hey, Julie. What's up?

133
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,266
Hold up.

134
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,811
You're gonna take a call
while we're talking?

135
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,188
-You know how rude that is?
-Hey! Thanks for calling.

136
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,690
Otherwise, people might think
I'm talking to myself.

137
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,859
Right. Nice.

138
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,903
No. But, yeah. I think "Great" is a...

139
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,905
great choice.

140
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,906
Sweet. Well...

141
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,244
I mean, that's pretty much
what I wanted to talk to you about. So...

142
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,245
Oh!

143
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,621
OK.

144
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,834
Uh, actually, no, there is one more thing
I wanted to talk to you about. It's...

145
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,545
Look, I know I'm not the easiest person
to work with,

146
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:05,007
but I... I wanted to tell you
that I think you make me a better writer.

147
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,053
I think we make each other better.

148
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,683
You know what? Why don't you just
ditch school today? Let's go rehearse.

149
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,059
What? No. No.

150
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,186
I promised dad, school first.

151
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,481
Right. You were at school first,
and now you're leaving to go rehearse.

152
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,775
Come on. I can't do this without you.

153
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,486
I can't. I...

154
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,573
- I told Nick I'd be his dance partner.
- Hey, Julie!

155
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,493
And he's heading this way. Gotta go. Bye.

156
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,829
- Hey!
- Well, don't you look sharp.

157
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,289
You ready for our big performance?

158
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,500
Oh yeah. Yeah.
We're gonna do great.

159
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,918
I'm glad you're confident.

160
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,630
Even after three classes,
I still think I got worse.

161
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,091
It's a good thing I got my secret weapon.

162
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,802
Uh-oh! I think
somebody has a crush on Julie.

163
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,970
Shut up.

164
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,474
Um... Shut up!

165
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,603
No, seriously, Molina.
I... I... I'm nothing without you.

166
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,229
Shh. No. No, you're...

167
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,856
You're gonna do fine.

168
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,232
See you in there?

169
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,235
Yeah. I'll be the guy
trying not to make us look stupid.

170
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,449
Well, he's just too cute!

171
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,367
Boundaries.

172
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,036
I'll see you after school.

173
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,623
Guess we'll just have to carry you tonight
just like we always do!

174
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,542
I know you're smiling.

175
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,420
Kill it on the dance floor.

176
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,006
Boys,

177
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,925
I want you to focus

178
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,718
and leave it all out on the field.

179
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,056
-You're losing them, Frank.
-No. I got 'em.

180
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,432
Breathe in...

181
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,850
...shake out your nerves.

182
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,311
Surrender to the music
and to your partner.

183
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,312
Here we go.

184
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,190
Oh, ah!

185
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,650
Uh...

186
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,236
I... I don't remember anything
about surrendering.

187
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,987
You'll be fine, Luke.

188
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,656
It... it's Nick, actually.

189
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,699
Right! Nick. Sorry.

190
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,618
My brain was wandering.

191
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,913
But it wandered back...
and now I'm ready to kill it.

192
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,461

Yeah.

217
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,849
Um...

218
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,643
That was great.

219
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,729
I gotta get going.

220
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,568
-Good job, man.
-Hey, thanks, homie. Hey, you too, dude.

221
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,287
Look, we add the echoes during the chorus,
then when Julie comes in with the melody,

222
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,872
it's gonna sound perfect.

223
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,713
Again? What's that all about?

224
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,880
I don't know.

225
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,468
What's your problem?

226
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,138
It's like you're tracking me down
just so you can keep running away.

227
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,432
I wish I could explain, man, but I can't.

228
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,225
Wait. That's not good enough.

229
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,145
I mean, you've been acting weird
ever since Caleb's club.

230
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,356
You know,
I thought we were having fun together.

231
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,568
We never should've met.

232
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,822
Wow, that hurts.

233
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,074
Hey, I'm sorry, Alex. I really am.

234
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,367
You're a great guy.

235
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,579
I gotta go.

236
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,388
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

237
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,599
Why'd you run out of dance class so fast?

238
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:50,227
Sorry. I just needed some air.
It was a little intense in there.

239
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,645
Oh, I noticed.

240
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,982
Dancing with a guy you've had a crush on
for forever will do that to a girl.

241
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,068
Yeah. But the whole time we were dancing,

242
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,863
- I was thinking about Luke.
- Seriously?

243
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,865
First off, called it.

244
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,035
Second, I know you always want
what you can't have,

245
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,205
but Luke is next-level.

246
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,166
I know.
And now I think Nick likes me. Nick!

247
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,667
He totally does.

248
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,337
But me and Luke just clicked.

249
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,339
And he's so--

250
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,965
Not real.

251
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,843
You can make all the music you want
with Luke, but...

252
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,470
he'll always be a phantom.

253
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,556
So... here's what we're gonna do.

254
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,228
Send Nick a nice little friendly text
asking him to come to your party tonight.

255
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,315
Um, I usually don't use
that many smiley faces.

256
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,318
You do now. I'm not gonna let you
get your heart broken.

257
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,904
And trust me.
Tonight, you're performing with Luke,

258
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,282
so the key is avoiding
those big, beautiful,

259
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,284
dead... eyes.

260
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,161
You're very pushy today.

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,121
You're welcome.

262
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,099
- Alex, you all right?
- Yeah.

263
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,517
Yeah. Yeah, why?

264
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,771
I know it's tough, man. People say
you never forget your first ghost.

265
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,064
Maybe that's true.

266
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,191
But... I'm sure there will be others.

267
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,735
Yeah. Thanks, Reg.

268
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,820
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

269
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,781
And, Alex, you're a great drummer
and a great guy, OK?

270
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,409
I wouldn't let all that stuff
get in between you and what you love.

271
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,704
I don't know, man. Sometimes a little fire
can make things better on stage.

272
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,205
Like you and Julie.

273
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,876
Uh, wha... What is that supposed to mean?

274
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,628
Come on. Everyone can see
the way you look at her when you sing.

275
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,213
You guys ooze chemistry.

276
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,300
You should never say "ooze" again,
but, yeah, I agree.

277
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,303
OK, no. I have chemistry
with everybody that I sing with.

278
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,431

Julie's one of my oldest friends.

292

I'm sure she just forgot to invite me.

299
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,168

I can't say this enough:
that was incredible.

358
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,582
But epic fail on that eye contact thing.

359
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,459
So how do you do those holograms?

360
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,838
Oh, don't try to understand it, Carlos.
I don't.

361
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:36,216
- That's because you're old.
- Funny guy.

362
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,927
I'd send you to your room,
but then who's gonna clean up this mess?

363
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,596
Don't poke the bear.

364
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,055
Mm-mm.

365
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,602
So what are the boys doing right now?

366
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,896
Hanging out, I guess.

367
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,024
You know, or whatever you do
when you're from where they're from.

368
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,276
Hey, so,
what cameras did you use out there?

369
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,737
Interested in my work?

370
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,532
Well, uh... I shot with an XF105.

371
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,076
That's what I used.
The latest model. It's very good.

372
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,787
But the other guys had the wide...

373
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,834
Whoo!

374
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,006
Feels like we should be celebrating
or something. What do you guys wanna do?

375
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,469
Not that.

376
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,013
That wasn't like the other ones.
It's getting worse.

377
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,765
Why is this happening to us?

378
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,934
It's because you guys
are in serious trouble.

379
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,477
Willie?

380
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,270
We need to talk.

381
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,566
All these jolts that we're feeling is
because Caleb put his stamp on us?

382
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,069
He's threatened by you.
He wants you under his control.

383
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,322
You're the only ghosts that can be visible
to lifers without his help.

384
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,241
And you let him do this to us?

385
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,742
I can't stop him.

386
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,369
He owns my soul.

387
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,913
All right?
He owns everybody's soul at that club.

388
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,582
If he even knew
I was here talking to you, he...

389
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,502
...he would destroy me.

390
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,587
So if we don't join his club,

391
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,049
the weird power outage thing continues
until there's no power left at all?

392
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,384
Yes.

393
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,844
What exactly happens
when the power goes out?

394
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,764
That's... That's it.

395
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,599
You're done.

396
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,103
Uh-huh. Yeah. And what exactly do you mean
by "we're done"?

397
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,940
You just...
You don't exist... anymore. Not anywhere.

398
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,817
-What?
-So we have no choice?

399
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,860
We have to say goodbye to Julie,

400
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,488
give up everything we've built together,
and work for Caleb?

401
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,492
That's some club you guys got going on.

402
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,661
But there is another option.
That's why I'm here.

403
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,121
Another option?

404
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,789
Just please hear me out.

405
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,085
All right. If you guys could figure out
what your unfinished business is,

406
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,463
you do it in time, you could cross over
and be free from all of this.

407
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,549
OK. So what's our unfinished business?

408
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,510
I don't know, but since you all died
at the same time,

409
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,345
it might be something
you need to do together.

410
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,597
Why should we listen to a word you say?

411
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,393
Because I care about you, Alex.

412
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,105
And I hate that I brought you...

413
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,566
and your friends into this mess.

414
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,443
I, uh...

415
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,069
I can't be away much longer.

416
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,405
I'm so sorry.

417
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,241
For everything.

418
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,790
This is all my fault.

419
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,544
I... I met Willie,
Willie introduced us to Caleb, and now...

420
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,005
now we're screwed.

421
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,007
We all wanted to go see Caleb.

422
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,467
We have to tell Julie.

423
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,095
No, we can't do that.
This just means more loss in her life.

424
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,473
But if we don't want Caleb
to own our souls,

425
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,475
we have to figure out
our unfinished business.

426
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,019
Yeah, man. And how are we supposed
to do that? All right?

427
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,271
There was so much we wanted to do.

428
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,070
What is it?

429
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,366
But the night we died, there was one thing
we all wanted to do together.

430
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,121
Play the Orpheum?

431
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,707
Getting that gig
was literally impossible.

432
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,167
Even after people knew who we were,

433
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,628
we had to hustle,
call in every favor we had.

434
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,047
It took us years.

435
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,303
Oh!

436
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,805
We don't have years.
