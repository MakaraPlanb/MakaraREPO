Whoo!

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,396
Yeah!

41
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,356
Thank you! We're Sunset Curve!

42
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,984
Too bad we wasted the tightest
we've played on sound check!

43
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,112
Wait until tonight, man, when this place
gets packed with record execs.

44
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,030
Alex, you were smoking.

45
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,409
Oh no. I was just warming up.
You guys were the ones on fire.

46
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,494
Could you just own your awesomeness
for once?

47
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,079
Huh?

48
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,248
All right, I was killing it.

49
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,252
OK, well, I'm thinking we fuel up
before the show. I'm thinking street dogs.

50
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,295
-Ooh!
-Yes.

51
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,965
Hey, Bobby, where you going?

52
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,550
I'm good.

53
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,303
Vegetarian. I could never hurt an animal.

54
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,555
You guys are really good.

55
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,472
Thank you.

56
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,141
I see a lot of bands.

57
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,352
Been in a couple myself.
I was really feeling it.

58
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,897
That's what we do this for.
I'm Luke, by the way.

59
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,148
-Hi, I'm Reggie.
-Alex.

60
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,232
Bobby.

61
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,483
Nice meeting you guys.

62
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,236
I'm Rose.

63
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,446
Oh, uh...

64
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,072
here's our demo.

65
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,242
And a T-shirt. Size beautiful.

66
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,538
Thanks.

67
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,083
I'll make sure not to wipe the tables down
with this one.

68
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:33,588
Oh, good call. Whenever they get wet,
they just kinda fall apart in your hands.

69
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,840
Don't you guys have to go get hot dogs?

70
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,968
Yeah, he had a hamburger for lunch.

71
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,266
That's what I'm talking about!

72
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,936
The smell of Sunset Boulevard?

73
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,063
No.

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,815
It's what
that girl said in there tonight.

75
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,443
About our music, all right?
It's like an energy.

76
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,903
It connects us with people.

77
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,322
They can feel us when we play.

78
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,743
I want that connection with everybody.

79
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,371
Then we're gonna need more T-shirts.

80
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,165
Let's go, boys.

81
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,087
Ladies.

82
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,633
Reggie, wait!

83
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,177
- Oh my God. Reggie!
- Oh my God! Hi, it's me!

84
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,768
Man... I can't wait until we eat someplace

85
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,230
where the condiments aren't served
out of the back of an Oldsmobile.

86
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,315
Hey...

87
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,444
Sorry, I got some pickle juice
on your battery cables.

88
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,280
No problem. It'll help with the rust.

89
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,075
That can't...

90
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,119
OK. What?

91
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,002
This is awesome, you guys.

92
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,129
We're playing The Orpheum!

93
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,507
I can't even count
how many bands have played here

94
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,384
and then ended up being huge.

95
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,886
We're gonna be legends!

96
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,556
Eat up, boys.

97
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,266
'Cause after tonight,

98
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,393
everything changes.

99
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,114
That's a new flavor.

100
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,658
Chill, man.
Street dogs haven't killed us yet.

101
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,988
Hey, underachiever.

102
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,656
Hey, disappointment.

103
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,368
OK, I know you don't want me to ask,
but have you figured out

104
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,703
-what you're gonna do today?
-I'll know in the moment.

105
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,913
Really, Jules?

106
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,456
That's all you're giving me?

107
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,917
Mrs. Harrison said
this is your last chance.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,043
I know.

109
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,127
I was there.

110
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,796
See you at the rally!

111
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,423
Ugh! What is she handing out?

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,301
-Hi!
-Desperation?

113
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,260
Mm.

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,973
Here you go. My group's performing
at the spirit rally tomorrow.

115
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,060
I'm sure
you guys have nothing better to do.

116
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,312
Oh my gosh, Carrie. Thanks!

117
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,565
Oh my gosh, Flynn. Don't bother coming!

118
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,155
Here you go.

119
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,908
Come see Dirty Candy tomorrow.

120
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,034
Nick?

121
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,202
Still?

122
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,955
You know they're gonna get married
and have a bunch of unholy babies.

123
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,915
Nick's a sweetheart.

124
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,917
You'd actually have to talk to him
to know that.

125
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,462
And only one of them has to be a demon
to make a demon baby.

126
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,047
Demon!

127
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,593
There's that smile.

128
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,762
Now, let's go prove everybody wrong.

129
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,159
Wow!

130
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:35,997
Nice job, Nick.

131
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,083
Almost as impressive
as your game against Glendale.

132
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,546
OK, we have one last performance.

133
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:44,922
Julie?

134
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,617
Take your time.

135
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:31,969
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,556
Is this when we clap?

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,643
Watch it, Carrie.

138
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,119
Oh good. You're home.

139
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,957
I was about to go
watch your brother's game.

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,252
I've had photo shoots all day.
Didn't even get a chance to eat.

141
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,920
But...

142
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,214
I got a phone call today.

143
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,842
Yeah, I figured as much.

144
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,052
Yeah.

145
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,597
-Well, it was my Realtor friend.
-Oh, that.

146
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,643
Yeah, and she says if we are serious
about selling the house,

147
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,729
then she wants me to take some pictures
for the website.

148
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,566
Which means
we have to do a lot of cleaning

149
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,359
and get rid of some stuff.

150
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,778
And maybe you can...

151
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,155
tackle Mom's studio?

152
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,702
You're the expert.

153
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,163
You know, your brother
and I wouldn't even know where to begin.

154
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,958
It's OK, honey. If you're not ready, I--

155
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,875
No.

156
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,711
It's all right.

157
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,631
Maybe I'll try tonight.

158
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,174
Yeah?

159
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,176
Awesome, mija. Thank you.

160
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,970
Oh, and don't forget the loft.

161
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,265
You know, those old instruments
that were there when we moved in?

162
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,100
They need a new home.

163
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,644
Mom would like that.

164
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,605
Yeah, she would.

165
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,357
Oh God. I'm gonna be late.

166
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,151
Under the mail.

167
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,029
You're a lifesaver.

168
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,423
I'm so sorry, Mom.

169
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,759
That I haven't been here.

170
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,983

184
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,129
911 means 911!

185
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,049
Why aren't you answering me?

186
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,550
Hey.

187
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,844
- Dad.
- Sorry.

188
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,306
Just wanted to make sure you were OK.

189
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,850
You don't believe me, do you?

190
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,562
Honey, of course I do.
Mija, I see your mom all the time.

191
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,897
This isn't like that.

192
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,899
I know. It's different for all of us.

193
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,109
Dad, you're not listening to me.

194
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,986
I saw something out there.

195
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,446
All right. OK. OK.

196
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,032
I'm listening.

197
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,868
Tell me what you saw.
It's just you and me here.

198
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,538
You sound just like Dr. Turner.

199
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,707
Well, maybe seeing Dr. Turner again
isn't such a bad idea.

200
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,625
Dad!

201
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,294
Can we just drop it?

202
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,879
All right.

203
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,381
Dropped.

204
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,303
We good?

205
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:07,763
Yeah.

206
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,934
Are you still here...

207
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,271
...whatever you are?

208
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,987
I know I saw something. I'm not crazy.

209
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,697
Well, we're all a little crazy.

210
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,825
Oh my God! Please stop screaming!

211
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,330
Who are you,
and what are you doing in my mom's studio?

212
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,208
Your mom's studio?
This is our studio. Trust me, my...

213
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,794
The grand piano is new,
and... and... and ...

214
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,588
My couch!

215
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,303
That is definitely not my six-string.

216
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,770
Can you give me just one second?

217
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,106
Just... give me a second. Thank you.

218
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,069
Guys, what is going on?
How did she get her stuff in here so fast?

219
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,906
Maybe... maybe she's a witch.
There's chairs floating on the ceiling.

220
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,741
OK, there is no such thing as witches.

221
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,577
You sure? I used to think
there was no such thing as ghosts.

222
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,954
That's fair.

223
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,580
OK, so we're going with witch?

224
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,290
No! We are not going with witch.

225
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,459
She's not a witch.
OK, look. She's just scared.

226
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,752
OK? Let someone

227
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,546
with a softer touch handle this.

228
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,844
Why are you in our studio?

229
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,847
Huh!

230
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,558
Oh my gosh! How did you do that?

231
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,811
Clearly, you're not understanding...
She doesn't get it.

232
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,480
OK, look. We're ghosts, all right?

233
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,108
We're just three ghosts,
and we're really happy to be home.

234
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,861
So, thank you for the flowers.
They really brighten up the room.

235
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,656
-We're in a band called Sunset Curve.
-Tell your friends.

236
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,158
Last night was supposed to be
a really big night for us.

237
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,410
It was gonna change our lives.

238
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,578
I'm, uh... I'm pretty sure it did.

239
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,999
This is freaking me out.

240
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,793
-What is that? What are you doing?
-It's my phone.

241
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,295
No! Stop talking to them.
They aren't real.

242
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,632
-There's no such thing as cute ghosts.
-Oh, think we're cute?

243
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,052
Who you calling?

244
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm Googling Sunset Swerve.

245
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,306
Sunset Curve!

246
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,686
Whoa.

247
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,896
There is a Sunset Curve.

248
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,566
You did die.

249
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,027
But not last night.

250
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,740
Twenty-five years ago?

251
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,784
What? No. No, no, no.
Th-Th-That's impossible.

252
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,369
After we floated out of the ambulance,

253
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,205
all we did was go to that weird,
dark room where Alex cried.

254
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,249
Well... I don't think...

255
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,585
I think we were all pretty upset. OK.

256
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,420
But that was just for like an hour.

257
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,338
We just showed up here.

258
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,091
Look. I'm just telling you
what my phone says.

259
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,552
See? You died in 1995.

260
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,970
When you were 17.

261
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,388
It's now 2020.

262
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,098
So, this is the future?

263
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,144
Wait. So... So, it has been 25 years.

264
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:48,442
I have been crying for 25 years?
How is that possible?

265
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,986
-Well, you're a very emotional person.
-I am not!

266
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,155
Thought you were afraid
to come out here.

267
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,201
You talking to your ghost friend?
How does he look? Is he hideous?

268
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,953
-He can see you.
-No, he can't.

269
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,122
What?

270
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,333
Uh... What do you want?

271
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,210
A normal sister, for starters.

272
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,087
Stop being weird and come eat.

273
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,799
He couldn't see you.

274
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,133
Yeah. I mean, that's...

275
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,886
- usually how ghosts work.
- Hmm.

276
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,350
Look, I'm very sorry
for what happened to you guys,

277
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,227
but this isn't your studio anymore.

278
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,895
You have to leave.

279
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,938
But wait. We...

280
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,441
-We didn't get your name.
-It's Julie.

281
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,442
Cool.

282
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,236
I-I'm Luke,

283
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,362
by... by the way.

284
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,364
-And this is--
-Reggie. I'm Reggie.

285
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,365
- Hey.
- And...

286
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,117
Alex. How's it going?

287
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,160
Ba-da.

288
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,455
OK?

289
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,876
Julie seems nice.

290
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,589
Did you miss the part
where she kicked us out, or...

291
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,925
Yes. OK.

292
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,808
There we go!

293
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,018
OK.

294
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,229
-Let's do this.
-Let's do it.

295
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,150
Your turn, Carlos.

296
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,736
Thank you for our leftovers
and the power of the mighty microwave.

297
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,280
-Amen.
-Amen.

298
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,243
So...

299
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,039
Carlos tells me
he found you in the studio.

300
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,834
She was out there talking to herself.

301
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,128
I was rehearsing for a play.

302
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,671
Hello, hello!

303
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,631
Oh, busted!

304
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,592
Yeah, we're in here. Quick!

305
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,055
Huh!

306
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,682
Spaghetti. Again?

307
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,683
Yeah.

308
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,310
That's too bad.

309
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,396
I brought you my pasteles
and arroz con pollo.

310
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,106
- Yum.
- Mm!

311
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,317
Thanks, tia. It smells great.

312
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,776
You can have it tomorrow.

313
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,529
I can't let you have leftovers
every night.

314
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,408
My sister would kill me,
may she rest in peace.

315
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,829
Oh... I see things here are going better?

316
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,497
Actually...

317
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,919
...Julie has been cleaning out
mom's studio.

318
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,048
Hopefully, we can get the house
on the market and some offers soon.

319
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,133
Well, I like the sound of that.

320
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,928
Moving from here
is only gonna help you move on.

321
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,183
You've got to rip that Band-Aid off
and get the pain over with.

322
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,524
That's me. Ripping off the Band-Aid.

323
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,567
Aah!

324
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,736
There's my brave girl.

325
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,113
Hey, Julie, I really like
what you guys did with the place.

326
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,823
You shouldn't be here.

327
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,201
Oh, I'm just here to help, mija.

328
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,828
Oh... I think that's our cue to leave.

329
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,206
I mean, you should be at Pilates.

330
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,625
- Thanks for bringing us food.
- Oh.

331
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,752
- We should've called first.
- It's nothing.

332
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,505
And now that
you're no longer in the music program,

333
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,258
you can concentrate on classes
that matter.

334
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,303
You got the e-mail from the school, right?

335
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:04,930
Yeah.

336
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,349
We're still discussing it.

337
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,520
Bueno. I'm off to Pilates.

338
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,188
-Mwah!
-Oh yeah!

339
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,691
Wa-chow! It's gone.

340
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,366
So, Julie,

341
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,703
wanna hear how I slid into home
and was almost safe?

342
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,706
You're a good brother.
That's not gonna work.

343
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,082
I tried.

344
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,172
Why didn't you tell me?
You made me lie to your aunt.

345
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,968
Sorry. I was gonna tell you after dinner.

346
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,178
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-I was.

347
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,805
Honey,

348
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,433
I know those classes can be difficult,

349
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,729
but you still like music, don't you?

350
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,025
I don't know. Maybe.

351
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:02,362
Look, we talked about this, you know?
And how painful memories can be, but...

352
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,783
You know, every time I see you and Carlos,
I see Mom.

353
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,702
It's like she's right here with us.

354
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,164
But you know what? I love that. I do.

355
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,250
And maybe if you'd give yourself a chance,

356
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,461
you'll get there.

357
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,301
What's that?

358
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,095
I must have left the stereo on
in the garage.

359
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,180
I'll go get it.

360
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,692
Guys! Guys, stop!

361
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,403
Enough! Stop! Cut it out!

362
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,745
The whole neighborhood could hear you.
I thought I told you to leave.

363
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,747
Wait. People can hear us play?

364
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,375
Yes! And so did my dad and my brother!

365
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,459
W-W-Wait. Wait.

366
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,336
So, only you can see us,

367
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,463
but everyone can hear us?

368
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:06,301
-I mean, what kind of ghosts are we?
-Who cares, man? People can hear us play!

369
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,553
We might be dead, but our music isn't.

370
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,223
Dad!

371
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,182
Hey.

372
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,893
Just making sure you're OK.

373
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,604
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had to turn off the CD player.

374
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,232
Wait. Is this the junk
that was in the loft?

375
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,483
Junk?

376
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,448
Some of this stuff's in pretty good shape.

377
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,077
Hey, maybe we can make a couple bucks.

378
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,039
What? Yo, stop touching my drums.
Tell him to stop touching my drums.

379
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,750
I liked that song you had on.

380
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,503
-Sweet! We're Sunset Curve.
-Tell your friends.

381
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,672
It's just an old CD I found.

382
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,842
Well, still, it's nice
that you're listening to music again.

383
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,302
Out here you can play whatever you want,
whenever you want.

384
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,220
Oh!

385
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,513
That's nice!

386
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,722
Stay out of this.

387
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,058
I-I'm sorry, honey. I didn't...

388
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,644
Oh no, no, no, no. Not you.
I mean... Uh... Er...

389
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,230
You know, give me a minute.

390
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,274
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

391
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,860
We'll figure out this music program thing.

392
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,069
Thanks, Dad.

393
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,246
-He likes our song.
-Oh yeah. He doesn't count.

394
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,414
He's a dad.

395
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,833
Why can't you guys just be normal ghosts?

396
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,545
Hang out at an old mansion.
I hear Pasadena's nice.

397
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,588
Ugh!

398
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,383
I think she's warming up to us.

399
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,343
Yeah, I've always wanted
to go to Pasadena.

400
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,261
Hmm.

401
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,723
Aah!

402
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,558
Stop that. I'm serious.

403
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,851
Oh, I'm sorry.

404
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,269
What do you want?

405
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,649
I know this is all completely insane,
but you do know how rad this is?

406
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,068
People... Actual people can hear us play.

407
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:51,114
Yeah, it's just
I've just had a really, really awful day.

408
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,950
-I gotta go.
-Well, I'm sorry you had a bad day,

409
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,329
but three guys just found out
that they had a bad 25 years,

410
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,665
and then they found out
that the one thing they lived for

411
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,709
in the first place they can still do.

412
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,836
That's pretty rad.

413
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,754
You're right.

414
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,381
-It's just...
-Your bad day.

415
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,218
Yeah.

416
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,135
I know.

417
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,057
Look, I'm sorry we came into your life,

418
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,684
but...

419
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,772
what I just felt in there
actually made me feel alive again.

420
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,108
We all felt alive again.

421
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,988
So, you can kick us out if you want,
but we're not giving up music.

422
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,949
We can play again.

423
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,576
That's a gift
no musician would ever turn down.

424
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,747
You gotta know that.

425
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,749
Clearly, your mom is into music.

426
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,292
Was.

427
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,003
She passed away.

428
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,549
I am...

429
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,092
so sorry.

430
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,637
Yeah, we... we didn't know.

431
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,350
It's all right.

432
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,022
You guys haven't seen her anywhere,
have you?

433
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,691
From wherever you're from.

434
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:08,942
Um...

435
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,904
No. No, I mean, you're kind of
the first person we've seen.

436
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,700
Yeah, but she's not dead,
so it doesn't answer her question.

437
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,202
Yeah. I think she knows what we mean.

438
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,914
I'm sorry for your loss.

439
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,208
Thanks.

440
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,837
Sorry I got mad.

441
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,590
You guys are kinda good.

442
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,133
Kinda?

443
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,304
Y-Y-You know that's like 25 years of rust
just getting dusted off.

444
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,098
- Yeah. Do you play the piano too?
- No.

445
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,934
No, I don't play.
That was my mom's stuff in there.

446
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,562
No way. She's an amazing songwriter.

447
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,397
She was.

448
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,609
Wait. How would you know?

449
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,945
There's a song on the piano.
If it's hers...

450
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,699
Your mom was really talented.

451
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,422
I guess...

452
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,883
if you need a place to stay,

453
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,345
you can stay in there.

454
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,388
There's a bathroom in the back

455
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,475
and a couch that turns into a bed
if you still use any of that stuff.

456
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,643
Dibs on the shower!

457
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,980
I just really like showers
and sometimes the occasional bath.

458
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:31,941
This...

459
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,445
This is just too weird.

460
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,030
Yeah.

461
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,961
"What would you say if I told you

462
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,254
there are three ghosts

463
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,548
living in my mom's studio?"

464
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,762
You'd say I'm crazy.

465
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,833
Huh?

466
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,507
Hey, I know
being dead isn't our first choice,

467
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,552
but, I mean,
it sure is easy getting around.

468
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,345
Easy for you, maybe.

469
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,013
I lost my shirt on that one.

470
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,142
Ooh, never mind! There it is.

471
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,896
OK, so,

472
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,399
why'd you bring us here?

473
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,652
Just another painful reminder
of where we never got to play.

474
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,865
-Thanks, Luke.
-I mean, boys, the game isn't over yet.

475
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,287
I'm telling you,
we've been given a second chance.

476
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,580
Let's find some music.

477
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,166
Let's see how many clubs
we can hit before sunrise.

478
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,752
Hey!

479
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,174
Hey, Alex. You coming?

480
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,134
Let's go!

481
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,653
Guys?

482
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,657
