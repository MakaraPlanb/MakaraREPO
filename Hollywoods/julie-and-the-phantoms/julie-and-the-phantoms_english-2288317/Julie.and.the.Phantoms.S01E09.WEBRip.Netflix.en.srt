1
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,737
Look, don't worry, guys.
Willie said he'd get us on that marquee.

2
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,698
This is gonna work, right?

3
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,324
It has to.

4
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,412
Hey, are you guys OK?

5
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,167
Yeah.

6
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,669
Yeah, it's nothing we haven't felt before.

7
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,797
How'd it go?

8
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,008
Well, when that opening band wakes up,

9
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,386
they're gonna find their bus
200 miles outside of Vegas

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,722
with no chance of getting back in time.

11
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,225
And that means there's probably a promoter
upstairs right about now freakin' out.

12
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,769
Nah. This is Hollywood, man.

13
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,771
I'm sure he's being very professional.

14
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,984
What do you mean the bus drove itself
into the middle of the desert?

15
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,320
Buses don't drive themselves!

16
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:21,915
I know...

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,917
how much you're risking.

18
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,047
Thank you, Willie.

19
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,550
I told you,

20
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,552
I'd do anything for you.

21
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,197
All right. You, uh...

22
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,535
You'd better get out of here
before Caleb catches you with us.

23
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,829
Yeah.

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,748
I'll see you around,

25
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,833
hot dog.

26
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,551
Alex, you all right, man?

27
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,763
Yeah.

28
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,390
Yeah, I'm OK.

29
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,559
Well, thanks to Willie,

30
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,602
Panic! At The Disco needs an opening band.

31
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,689
Then I guess someone up there
needs to know we're available.

32
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,110
No... No, stop. Stop!

33
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,196
- ...by itself.
- Stop! stop saying the bus drove itself.

34
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,908
OK.

35
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,244
Yeah, Willie was right.
This guy's a total pro.

36
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,165
All right, boys. Let the magic happen.
Alex, no dancing.

37
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,256
What?

38
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,884
Ugh!

39
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,345

Did they like us? Are we playing?

Someone answer!
Why's no one talking?

65

Whoa! That's a lot of questions!

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,539
-Luke, you wanna take this one?
-Take a seat.

67
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,751
It's fine. Everything's fine.

00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,088

Hello?

74
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,817
Hi, this is Tasha
from the Orpheum in Hollywood.

75
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,237
Is this Julie of Julie and the Phantoms?

76
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,575
Yes, it is.

77
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,743
Hi.

78
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,912
Are you available to open for us tonight?

79
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,913
Yeah, totally.

80
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,790
-OK.
-Thank you so much.

81
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,917
- See you then.
- We're doing it!

82
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,005
We're playing the Orpheum, baby! Yeah!

83
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,047
Yeah!

84
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,716
I'm swimming.

85
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,760
I'm telling you, tía, it was a win-win.

86
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,806
The ghost is gone, and me and Dad
got a killer French dip sandwich.

87
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,267
But how do you know
the ghost is really gone?

88
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,561
I don't wanna get emotional,

89
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,480
but I felt something
when I took that last bite.

90
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,942
Like his tortured spirit was set free.

91
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,403
Sure it wasn't one
of your little tummy toots?

92
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,322
I don't tummy toot!

93
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,365
I'm a ghost hunter now.

94
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,869

161

171

this is our last night together,

172
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,805
it doesn't mean we won't be watching you
from above... or...

173
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,852

Have a good show, boy band.

181
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,137
Who you calling boy band?

182
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,221
Carlos.

183
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,854
How did he find out about us?

184
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,815
I don't know, Reg.
Maybe it was the blinds.

185
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,150
Or you know what? The blanket.

186
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,194
It could've been any number of things
you did in that house.

187
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,739
It doesn't matter, you guys.

188
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,657
We're not coming back here anyways.

189
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,036
And where is it
that you think you're going?

190
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,120
What are you doing here?

191
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,080
Such hostility!

192
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,334
I'm just here to congratulate you
on your big night.

193
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,253
Not everyone gets to play the Orpheum.

194
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,006
No. OK, we know
that it's your stamp that's hurting us.

195
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,174
Hmm...

196
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:37,303
We already told you, we have a band.
We don't wanna join your little club.

197
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,138
Yeah. And you can't make us either.

198
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,558
Sir.

199
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,018
Right.

200
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,104
You're crossing over tonight. So exciting!

201
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,357
Funny thing about the cross over,

202
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,902
no one really knows
what's waiting on the other side.

203
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,281
But I know what's happening on this side.

204
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,707
Ticket, please.

205
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,589
Ticket, please.

206
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,353
Hey, Julie, I've got your roadie.

207
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,604
Come in.

208
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,526
Holograms are good to go, boss.

209
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,278
Best roadie ever.

210
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,823
I'll be back in a few minutes
to walk you to the stage.

211
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,949
Thanks, Rob.

212
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,872
You see this backstage pass?

213
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,333
I had sushi with Brandon Urie!

214
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,670
Good for you. I threw up in the car
on the way over here.

215
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,755
And you still look amazing.

216
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,218
I made friends with the tech crew.
You're gonna love what we have planned.

217
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,387
The guys are here, right?

218
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,888
I haven't seen them.

219
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,893
Wait. You don't think they changed
their mind and took Caleb's offer, do you?

220
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,730
No. No, that's the last thing
that they wanted.

221
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,487
You're gonna kill it.

222
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,532
We should get some snacks.

223
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,546
Uh...

224
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,215
Well, don't you look nice?

225
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,052
Sweet threads.

226
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,847
How... How'd you know our sizes?

227
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,015
That's your question?

228
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,020
I know you boys aren't my biggest fans.

229
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,273
And an eternity at my club
might seem overwhelming.

230
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:59,320
But... I just put you in sweet threads,
so humor me this one last pitch.

231
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,447
Now, for starters,

232
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,159
isn't it nice
that you're all here together?

233
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,288
And believe me, everything you want,

234
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,624
including Willie, is here.

235
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,418
And on my stage,

236
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,962
you don't vanish when the music stops.

237
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:21,175
You soak in the applause
for as long as you want.

238
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,970
The connection that you will feel
with that audience

239
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,348
will be like no other.

240
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,059
I promise.

241
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,269
Oh! Shh. Do you hear that?
They're waiting for you.

242
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,564
That one looked like it hurt.

243
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,942
Now, let me remind you,

244
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,071
you don't know if playing the Orpheum
is your unfinished business.

245
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,448
Do you really have time
to make that mistake?

246
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,367
I suggest

247
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,787
you accept my offer,
because the clock is ticking.

248
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,040
Ouch!

249
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,500
You know where to find me.

250
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,548
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm back!

251
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,008

Hey, Julie, it's time.

294
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,445
Just a second.

295
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,409
Something's wrong.

296
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,413
The boys were getting those jolts
pretty bad as I was leaving.

297
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,125
And they wouldn't stand me up again.

298
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,670
They must have run out of time.

299
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,756
I'm so sorry, Jules.

300
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,177
They didn't cross over.

301
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,014
They're gone.

302
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,057
And I didn't even get to say goodbye.

303
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,815
Hey, Julie, you're on.

304
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,067
Wait.

305
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,406
What are you doing, Jules?

306
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,532
Where is she going?

307
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,909
Where do any of us really go?

308
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,163
We've got a problem.

309
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,848
I don't know
if you can hear me, Mom, but...

310
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,895
...I can't handle it.

311
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,483
Flynn says you're supposed to be
behind everything, but I don't know.

312
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,903
If I was supposed to help the guys,

313
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:52,821
I didn't.

314
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,115
They're gone.

315
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,118
And I'm so sorry.

316
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,538
They were my friends.

317
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,207
My band.

318
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,045
My family.

319
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,513
Why can't you just come pick me up...

320
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,599
and... and hold me in your arms

321
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,768
and just tell me
that everything's gonna be OK

322
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,145
and that I'm gonna get through it?

323
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,482
And that...

324
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,487
That even though they're not here
with me, they're still up there with you.

325
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,825
I just wish you were here.

326
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,195
Ladies.

327
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,655
Trevor.

328
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,698
Guys.

329
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,123
Let Panic know they are going on now.

330
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,627
Signs.

331
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,547
Wait. Where are you going?

332
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,340
She's going on stage.

333
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,300
Hold on.

334
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,135
Julie just walked onto the stage.

335
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,178
That's my girl!

336
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,889
Welcome to Live at the Orpheum.

337
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,058
Now give it up for Julie and the Phantoms.

338
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,783
Hi. I'm Julie.

339
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,784
Um...

340
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,830
Tonight, I'd like to dedicate this song
to my mom,

341
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,876
who's been there with me
every time I've played.

342
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,794
And thank her for...

343
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,005
not giving up on me.

344
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,261
I'd also like to dedicate
tonight's performance to...

345
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,555
three special friends...

346
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,184
who have changed my life completely,

347
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,354
who have brought music back to me.

348
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,065
It was their dream to play here, and...

349
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,067
this is for them.

350
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,404
This song is for anyone
who's lost their way.

351
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,199
Step into your greatness.

352
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,660
Don't give up.

353
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,495
Stand tall.

354
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,038
Thank you.

355
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,470

for bringing music back into your life.

I already did.

433
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,532
But I didn't thank you, Papi.

434
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,542
Hey, Julie,
uh, can I talk to you for a second?

435
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,585
Yeah. Yeah, um, just give me a minute.

436

442

00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,425

00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,489
No... no!

448
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,409

Why didn't you cross over?

00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,538

our unfinished business.

451
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,669
We wanted you to think
that we crossed over, so we pretended to.

452
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,546
We just...

453
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,259
We had nowhere else to go.

454
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,554
We thought you'd go straight to bed.

455
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,181
Yeah, well,

456
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,143
I knew she was gonna come out here,
but nobody ever listens to me.

457
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,481

458
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,524

-We're not going back there.

462
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,497

if we're not making it with you.

463
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,751

464
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,633

475
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,524

476
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,947
I think the band's back.

477
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,997
You guys think we could try that hug thing
one more time?

478
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,749
Yeah.

479
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,169

00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,048
