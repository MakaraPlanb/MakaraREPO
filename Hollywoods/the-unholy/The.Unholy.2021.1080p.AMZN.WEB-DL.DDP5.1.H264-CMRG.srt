00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:16,090
1917, Fátima, Portugal.

318
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:19,627
Three shepherd children reported
apparitions of the Virgin Mary,

319

1981, Medjugorje, Bosnia.

321

Six witnesses observed
a Marian apparition.

322
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,609
Many claim that the
Holy Mother continues

323
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:38,980
to visit this shrine
to this very day.

324
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:42,183

325
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:46,988
All three shrines draw
millions of faithful each year.

326
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:50,591
In Lourdes alone,
over 5000 miraculous cures

327
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,927
- have been recorded.
- <b><font color="#ca6500">GERRY:</font></b> Excuse me.

328
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,797
Are you saying that Banfield
could become such a shrine?

329
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:01,335
Well, first we have
to, uh, confirm

330
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:04,138
that an actual miracle
has truly occurred.

331
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:06,140
And that is why
Monsignor Delgarde here

332
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,442
has been tasked by the Vatican

333
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:11,245
to investigate these,
uh, alleged healings.

334
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:12,847
Monsignor.

335
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:18,652
In the 18th century,
Pope Benedict XIV

336
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:20,621
laid out a procedure
to determine

337
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:23,357
the veracity of a miracle.

338
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:25,760
The main steps are:

339
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:28,863
the illness must be incurable,

340
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:31,766
the cure must be instantaneous,

341
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:34,335
the cure must be complete.

342
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,170
In my capacity as inquisitor,

343
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:39,740
I intend to use all medical
science and technology available

344
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:43,344
to disprove the alleged miracle

345
00:25:43,477 --> 00:25:45,179
and expose any deceit.

346
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:51,185
If I fail, the miracle is
to be considered genuine.

347
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,157
Meanwhile,
the church has installed

348
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,060
a shelter over the site to
protect it from the elements

349
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:01,362
and, uh, public intrusion.

about his church
becoming a shrine.

387
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,811
Alice is speaking perfectly,

388
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:00,447
though she has never heard
any form of speech before.

389
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:03,050
- How do you explain that?
- There are various degrees

390
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:04,685
of deafness, Mr. Fenn.

391
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:07,288
Alice may have been
unconsciously hearing all along.

392

- Come on.
- Are you Catholic?

393
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,660
I was raised Catholic. Lapsed.

394
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:14,028
Spiritually and professionally,
it would appear.

395
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:17,064
My lack of faith
could be an advantage.

396
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:19,166
Having a neutral observer along

397
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,504
to record the process
would be healthy.

398
00:28:22,637 --> 00:28:25,439
Now, you may find someone
more devout, but...

399
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:28,008
But they'd be accused of bias.
Yeah.

400
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:29,843
Give me the exclusive.

401
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:32,514
