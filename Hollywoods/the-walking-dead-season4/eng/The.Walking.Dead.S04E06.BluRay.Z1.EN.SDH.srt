We're a little on edge.

54
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,614
We've been holed up in here
waiting for the National Guard since--

55
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,366
- The shit hit the fan.
- Language.

56
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,327
Since the crap hit the fan.

57
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:14,623
Which it did, right before it got flung
all over the damn place.

58
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,464
Are you planning
on staying in the building?

59
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,095
Are you planning on staying or not?

60
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,224
- Holy shit, with the no talking.
- Tara.

61
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,311
My sister asked you a question.

62
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,313
Just for the night.

63
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,399
You see this?

64
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,612
This here is a fully loaded,
standard issue Smith & Wesson.

65
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,364
I'm Atlanta City Police and I have
enough artillery in here

66
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,618
to kill you every day
for the next 10 years.

67
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,330
You mess with me or my family,

68
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,665
and I swear to Christ,
I will put you down.

69
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,835
Got it?

70
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,046
Got it.

71
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,091
Then we're cool.

72
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,509
Pound it.

73
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,599
Here, bro.

74
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,561
We'll hold onto this until you go.

75
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,106
Yeah.

76
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,158
You got a name?

77
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,958
Brian.

78
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,170
Brian Heriot.

00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,977

80
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,448
You got to be hungry.

You're not gonna find
anything better in there.

00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,249
Tara ransacked the place

Big fan of butter beans,
Miss Wilhelm.

84
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,019
Thank you.

85
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,386
...four, five.

86
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,474
Come on, kiddo.
Show me what you got here.

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Woman:
Everything okay?

88
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,574
She didn't eat again.

89
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,160
She likes the corned beef.
Try that.

90
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,828
I'm saving the last two cans for Dad.

91
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,830
She's not picky, she's terrified.

92
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,999
- ( floorboards creak )
- Shh.

93
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,840
- ( floorboards creak )
- ( gun hammer clicks )

94
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,053
Why don't you slow down,
buddy, all right?

95
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,471
This ain't the Holiday Inn.

96
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,306
Bucket on the left is for washing,

97
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,517
right is for rinsing.

98
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,686
Tara.

99
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,814
Oh.

100
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,702
Sorry.

101
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,037
You get enough to eat?

102
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,039
( man coughing )

103
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,876
I'll get you some coffee.

104
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,713
Sit down.

105
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,673
Right there. Go on.

106
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,935
Man:
Go ahead, roll again.

107
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,772
Hey, come here.

108
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,025
You got a cigarette?

109
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,776
Woman:
Dad, your oxygen tank.

110
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,362
Do you not see that red sticker?

111
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,907
I'll be damned if a Merit Ultra Menthol
is gonna blow this place up

112
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,493
after all the work we've done
to stay alive up here. Okay?

113
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,495
It's all the same, Lily.

114
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,831
You can stop that talk right there.

115
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,208
It's just a cigarette.

116
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,879
Help yourself.

117
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,298
We got roni sticks for days.

118
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,425
Years, probably.

119
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,927
You see that big truck parked outside?

120
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,222
Come on, dude,
the Gorbelli food truck.

121
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,185
Ray Charles could have seen it.

122
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,686
Yeah.

123
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,565
Dad drove for them.
Even with the tank.

124
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,275
The day they closed down the 75--

125
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,819
When the S-H-I-T
hit the fan.

126
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,073
He grabbed Megan from school,
picked me up at the hospital--

127
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,867
She stole a bunch of oxygen tanks
from that dump.

128
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,952
Then the three of us
rushed over to get Tara.

129
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,081
I was at the station working, booking.

130
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,836
With everything going on,

131
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,965
the attacks,
the Army going into Atlanta,

132
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,468
he wasn't about to let us
out of his sight.

133
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,803
Tara:
Lucky for us, the old man's truck

134
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,639
was pretty much stocked floor to ceiling
with sketti rings,

135
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:07,434
turkey chili, and these little suckers.

136
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,605
Man:
Meg, Granddad needs a break, okay?

137
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,274
- Lily.
- Sure, Daddy.

138
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,781
On three.

139
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,616
A little help here, big guy.

140
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,078
Lily:
Here.

141
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,163
Oh, right.
No, not you.

142
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,998
The other big guy in the room.

143
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,918
Lily:
Tara.

144
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,087
- ( groaning )
- Lily: Okay.

145
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,672
On three.

146
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,341
Okay, one, two--

147
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,312
Here. Here.

148
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,859
( footsteps )

149
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,987
- ( floorboards creak )
- Hey. You hear them?

150
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,738
Yeah.

151
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,199
Yeah.

152
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,202
Get my legs, friend?

153
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:14,293
Tara's been up there a bunch of times
blasting them bastards to pieces.

154
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:18,213
She says they just
keep getting back up.

155
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,425
I told her no more.

156
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,219
Can't afford to waste her bullets.

157
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,639
( coughs )

158
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,809
You got kids?

159
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,188
No.

160
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,482
When my girls were born,

161
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,860
that's when I finally figured out
what it was to be a man.

162
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,112
You know, a real man.

163
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,864
( coughs )

164
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,241
You protect them,
you keep them safe.

165
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:50,579
You just try to make them stronger
until they can look out for themselves.

166
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,248
But this here,

167
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,543
I-- I never counted on this.

168
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,256
Hey, I got a buddy.

169
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,509
Bill Jenkins,
he lives up in 303.

170
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,929
He's got a real nice
backgammon set up there.

171
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,264
He won't mind and he keeps it
under his bed there.

172
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,726
Just... please.

173
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,478
You've been out there in the world

174
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,023
and you know how to handle
yourself around those things.

175
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,067
Look, I know you might
not understand it

176
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,110
'cause you don't got
a baby girl of your own,

177
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,112
but...
( coughs )

178
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,492
it might be something that might make
my Megan talk again.

179
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,870
Please.

180
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,842
( rustling )

181
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,958
( snarling )

182
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,925
( door opens )

183
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,858
Thank you.

184
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,320
You're welcome.

185
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,098
Couple things for the road.

186
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,518
I'm okay.

187
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,771
You helped us.

188
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,898
We're saying thank you.

189
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,858
Deal with it.

190
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,531
I guess you'll be needing this back.

191
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,535
Keep it.

192
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,080
Don't...

193
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,374
throw that at me.

194
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,379
It's your gun.
You can have it back.

195
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,174
You need another one.

196
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,884
I have this.

197
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,682
Tara was right.
We should have frisked you.

198
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,560
I found it upstairs.

199
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,231
You keep that.

200
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,989
You have to kill the brain.

201
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,574
What?

202
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,410
Your sister,
she shot 'em in the body,

203
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,080
but you have to hit 'em here.

204
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,541
That's what kills them.

205
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,042
Why?

206
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,425
I need to ask you something.

207
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,764
My dad's got stage four lung cancer.

208
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,267
I worked oncology for a few years.

209
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,228
He's nearing the end.

210
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,775
He's got about two days of oxygen.

211
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,443
Maybe less.

212
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,656
We never thought
he'd make it this long.

213
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,368
You've already done
so much for us, but...

214
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,124
There's an old folks home
a couple of blocks from here.

215
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:13,295
Even one tank
would mean everything.

216
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,381
He's the only one who can
put a smile on Megan's face...

217
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,051
...even for a second.

218
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,708
( snarling )

219
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,892
( snarling )

220
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,054
( snarling )

221
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,809
( snarling )

222
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,313
( scratching )

223
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,066
( snarling )

224
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,112
( walkers snarling )

225
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,461
( snarling grows louder )

226
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,762
( walkers snarling )

227
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,100
( grunts )

228
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,688
( gunshot )

229
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,707
( knocks )

230
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,505
- They're both full.
- Are you okay?

231
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,173
Yeah.

232
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,807
( pills rattling )

233
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,521
( door creaks open )

234
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,861
You didn't let me say thank you.

235
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,072
Yeah, I'm okay.

236
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,949
Sit.

237
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,830
Let me be a nurse again.

238
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,889
Good news is it doesn't look like
you need any stitches.

239
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,809
Bad news...

240
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,105
this is gonna sting like
a couple of angry bees.

241
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,533
Feels good to have something to do.

242
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,453
Nobody ever mentioned just how boring
the end of the world was gonna be.

243
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,673
( blowing )

244
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,856
She thought you were her dad.

245
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,524
Megan.

246
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,445
When she saw you
out there on the street.

247
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,783
He went out one night about
three and a half years ago

248
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,244
to get a couple beers
and a Powerball ticket.

249
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,413
Said he'd be right back.

250
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,460
Megan thought you were him,

251
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,963
finally coming right back.

252
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,011
- Megan: Mama.
- In here, honey.

253
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,974
Everything's okay, sweetheart.

254
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:05,313
Brian just got a boo-boo
that needs a little cleaning up.

255
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,440
Same as when you get a cut.

256
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,449
I don't have the ointment.

257
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,873
Why don't you watch
my patient until I get back?

258
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,708
Okay.

259
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,849
- What happened to your eye?
- It's gone.

260
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:47,272
Something happen to you
or were you just born like that?

261
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,274
Something happened to me.

262
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,737
Was that bad to ask?

263
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,703
No.

264
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,710
I'll tell you what happened to my eye,

265
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,087
but you have to promise
to keep it secret.

266
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,008
I promise.

267
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,178
What's that?

268
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,847
Pinkie swear.

269
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:32,025
Plus cross my heart
and hope to die.

270
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,405
Well...

271
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,742
I'm a pirate.

272
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,660
No way.

273
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,246
( laughing )

274
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,294
Yeah, you caught me.

275
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,925
What really happened was
I was trying to help someone.

276
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,596
Someone I loved very much.

277
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,098
How were you trying
to help them?

278
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,811
I was trying to protect them,
you know?

279
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,647
Stop them getting hurt.

280
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,524
But you got hurt instead.

281
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,526
Yeah.

282
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,989
Did they get hurt, too?

283
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,158
Uh...

284
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,285
yeah, yeah, they did.

285
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,290
I'm sorry.

286
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,379
Me, too.

287
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,138
Megan:
What is it?

288
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,807
Chess.

289
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,642
Looks hard.

290
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:52,063
Well, maybe for some folks,
but you're smart.

291
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,606
You'll catch on quick.

292
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,400
What's this one called?

293
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,610
That's a pawn.

294
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,113
They're your soldiers.

295
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,699
Do they die?

296
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,910
Sometimes.

297
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,329
Do you lose if they die?

298
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,665
No, not necessarily.

299
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,837
You can lose a lot of soldiers,
but still win the game.

300
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,051
That's the king.

301
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,972
That's the guy you want to capture.

302
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,359
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.

303
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,994
Looks like you.

304
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,040
Yeah.

305
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,251
( chuckles )

306
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,884
Come on, let's play.

307
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,264
So these ones are pawns.

308
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,403
Lily:
He's gone.

309
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,949
I think he's been gone a while.

310
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,286
( crying )

311
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,413
Y'all should go now.

312
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,832
Just give us a minute.

313
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,128
I love you, Daddy.

314
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,883
( growling )

315
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,095
- ( gasps )
- Lily: Tara!

316
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,474
- Tara: Stop! What are you doing?
- It's not Dad!

317
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,892
- Stop!
- It's not Dad!

318
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,394
( Megan screams )

319
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:59,268
I know, okay?

320
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:02,146
It happens no matter what?

321
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,023
Yeah.

322
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,568
I'm sorry.

323
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,406
He could have got me.

324
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:16,077
He almost got me.

325
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,249
I was thinking

326
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,336
he would have been grateful or whatever

327
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,255
that you stopped him, from him--

328
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,716
you know what I mean?

329
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,267
So, yeah, we're cool.

330
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,640
( shatters )

331
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,860
( knocks )

332
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,198
Good-bye.

333
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,200
No.

334
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,993
- We're coming with you.
- No.

335
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,996
There has to be someplace better
and you're gonna help us find it.

336
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,873
- Lily.
- I saw the picture, Brian.

337
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,793
You had a family, I know that.

338
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,337
And I know we're not them.

339
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,339
But for now, you're stuck with us.

340
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:36,217
- And that's just the way it's gonna be.
- I can't.

341
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,886
You already have.

342
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,607
Tara:
Where should we go?

343
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,776
Governor:
No use making a plan.

344
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,653
We'll go where they let us.

345
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,780
Who's they?

346
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,032
The roads.

347
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,076
The biters.

348
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,206
I'm not really a cop.

349
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:11,752
I mean, it's not a total lie.
I was in the academy.

350
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,674
I'm sorry I lied to you.

351
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,595
You don't have to be sorry.

352
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,806
Well, I am.

353
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,310
Do you think we can make it?

354
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,607
We'll make it.

355
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,611
Are you lying to me?

356
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,783
No.

357
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,724
Lily:
You can come join us, Megan.

358
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,649
It's just gonna take some time.

359
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,903
It's okay.

360
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,899
( engine grinding )

361
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:56,875
Governor:
We'll find another car soon.

362
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,752
Tara:
I hope you're right.

363
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,588
This whole country backdrop
is reminding me of Sam.

364
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,591
- Lily: Here we go.
- I thought she was the one.

365
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,344
Then you went camping,
ate mushrooms, game over.

366
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,054
You're forgetting the part where Sam
broke down

367
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:12,266
and told me she had a boyfriend,
that she wasn't really into chicks.

368
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,935
Ugh, worst weekend of my life.

Oh, man. Damn it!

- You all right?
- I'm fine.

372
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,445
- Tara, stop. Let me look at it.
- I'm fine!

373
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,406
Just hand me my backpack.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

374

375
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:35,456

377
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:40,961

Drop your bags.
Let's go. Come on.

380
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,767
- Tara: Megan.
- Megan, come on.

381

Governor:
Here.

388
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,918
Come on.

389

Go.

390
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,883
Move.

391
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,621
- Ah!
- ( Megan screams )

392
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,624
- Brian!
- I'm here.

393
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,004
( distant machine gunfire )

394
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,050
( screams )

395
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,304
( screams )

396
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,063

( panting )

402
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,089
I'm sorry. You okay?

403
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,925
You all right?

404
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,219
I'm never gonna let
anything happen to you.

405
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,430
Okay?

406
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,939
- Promise?
- Cross my heart.

407
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,778
Holy shit.

408
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,659
Cross my heart.
