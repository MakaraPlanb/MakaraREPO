1
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,182
( distant coughing )

2
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,863
You found them like this?

3
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,287
I came to see Karen...

4
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,124
...and I saw the blood on the floor.

5
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,087
Then I smelled them.

6
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,508
Somebody dragged them out here

7
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,928
and set them on fire.

8
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,140
They killed them
and set them on fire!

9
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,937
You're a cop.

10
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,814
You find out who did this
and you bring 'em to me.

11
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,983
You understand?
You bring 'em to me.

12
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,486
We'll find out who--

13
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,363
- I need to say it again?
- No. No.

14
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,450
I know what you're feeling.
I've been there.

15
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,203
You saw me there.
It's dangerous.

16
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,621
- Karen didn't deserve this.
- No.

17
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,623
David didn't deserve it.

18
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,833
- Nobody does.
- All right, man, let's--

19
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,711
Man, I ain't going nowhere
till I find out who did this!

20
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,011
We're on the same side, man.

21
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,805
Hey, look,

22
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,390
I know what you're going through.

23
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,603
We've all lost someone.

24
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,480
We know what you're going
through right now,

25
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,774
but you've got to calm down.

26
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,776
You need to step the hell back!

27
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,822
She wouldn't want you being like this.

28
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,950
Stop! Stop!

29
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,452
Carol:
Stop!

30
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,996
( grunting )

31
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,207
Daryl:
That's enough.

32
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,834
That's enough.

33
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,298
( grunts )

34
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,466
- Daryl: Rick.
- ( Tyreese groans )

35
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,303
- Stop.
- Let go of me!

36
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,639
- No. No.
- Let go of me!

37
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,307
No.

38
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,729
( sobbing )

39
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,780
( theme music playing )

40
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,986
This is gonna be sprained
at least a week.

41
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,155
( winces )

42
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,535
Good news, none of these cuts
need stitches.

43
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,916
I wouldn't plan on much
typing the next few days.

44
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,210
You okay?

45
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,048
It hurts.

46
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,259
I wasn't talking
about the hand.

47
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,056
We just went through
something terrible.

48
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,017
Everything we've been
working so hard to keep out,

49
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,395
it found its way in.

50
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,024
No.

51
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,568
It's always there.

52
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,240
Council meeting tomorrow morning.

53
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,243
Thought you should know.

54
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,122
We just lost
12 of our own.

55
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,125
Two more we killed in cold blood.

56
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,628
We could be facing an outbreak.

57
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,214
I think I've done
enough damage for one day.

58
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,593
I've fallen off
the wagon before.

59
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,097
- That's what this is?
- Pretty close.

60
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,684
When it happened, I didn't stand around
feeling bad about it.

61
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,727
I got back up.

62
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,521
I had responsibilities.

63
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,273
People to keep safe.

64
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,278
( grunting )

65
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,796
Let's get you cleaned up, man.

66
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:42,091
You might even need
a couple stitches.

67
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,469
Not until they're in the ground.

68
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,763
You should at least let Hershel
or Dr. S. take a look at you,

69
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,098
make sure nothing's broken.

70
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,478
When they're in the ground.

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,732
( grunting )

72
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,039
I'm gonna be okay, though, right?

73
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,460
I mean, Karen and David,
they were already sick.

74
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,879
So if we were gonna get it,
we'd have had it by now.

75
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,173
It doesn't happen on a timeline.

76
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,134
It's different with everyone.

77
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,679
But we could be okay.

78
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,848
Yeah, we could be.

79
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,809
Everything could be okay.

80
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,481
If it's walkers,
if it's people,

81
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,150
we can do something.
We can fight.

82
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,487
But with this,
I'm just digging graves.

83
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,866
( coughing )

84
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,046
Got to see Dr. S.

85
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,508
I'm gonna be okay.

86
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,695
( panting )

87
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,242
Dr. S....?

88
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,413
( people moaning, coughing )

89
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,425
( coughing )

90
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,519
Dr. S.?

91
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,481
( growling )

92
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,403
Dr. S.:
We have to tell them.

93
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,409
It's starting.

94
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,956
Hershel:
It's spread.

95
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,293
Everyone who survived
the attack in cell block D.

96
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,629
Sasha, Caleb, and now others.

97
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,464
Oh, Jesus.

98
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,175
So what do we do?

99
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,511
First things first.
Cell block A is isolation.

100
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,015
We keep the sick people there
like we tried with Karen and David.

101
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,183
What the hell we gonna do about that?

102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,767
Ask Rick to look into it.

103
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,811
Try to make a timeline--
who was where when.

104
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,147
But what are we gonna do
to stop this?

105
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,857
There is no stopping it.

106
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,693
You get it,
you have to go through it.

107
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,362
- But it just kills you?
- The illness doesn't.

108
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,157
The symptoms do.
We need antibiotics.

109
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,951
We've been through
every pharmacy nearby.

110
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,494
And then some.

111
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,372
That veterinary college
at West Peachtree Tech,

112
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,168
that's one place people may not have
thought to raid for medication.

113
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,046
The drugs for animals
there are the same we need.

114
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,881
That's 50 miles.

115
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,507
Too big a risk before.

116
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,218
Ain't now.
I'm gonna take a group out.

117
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,053
Best not waste any more time.

118
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,221
I'm in.

119
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,389
You haven't been exposed.

120
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,308
Daryl has.
You get in a car with him...

121
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,101
He's already given me fleas.

122
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,520
( chuckles )
I can lead the way.

123
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,105
I know where everything's kept.

124
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,945
When we're out there,
it's always the same.

125
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,780
Sooner or later we run.

126
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,492
I can draw you a map.

127
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,828
There are other precautions
I feel we should take.

128
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,497
Carol:
Like what?

129
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,626
There's no telling how long it'll be
before Daryl and his group return.

130
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,587
Wouldn't it make sense for us
to separate the most vulnerable?

131
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,714
We can use
the administration building.

132
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,424
Separate office,
separate room.

133
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,511
Who is the most vulnerable?

134
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,930
The very young.

135
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,350
What about the old?

136
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,771
( squeaking )

137
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,898
( gurgling )

138
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,526
Give me another go at it.

139
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,278
The whole line's mudded up.

140
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,946
The end is dragging
the bottom again.

141
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,407
We'll have to go out there and clear it.

142
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,867
Set the bird,
go out through the tombs,

143
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,703
swing around through
the forest route.

144
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,331
We got enough for now.
That's tomorrow's problem.

145
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,960
Rick, five more people have come down
with it since Sasha went in.

146
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,795
There's not a lot of us left.

147
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,131
What if you get sick?
What if I do?

148
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,466
What if we get in trouble out there
and don't come back?

149
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,677
Let's get this up
to the people who need it.

150
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,096
Let's get what
we have to get done first.

151
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,143
Is Carl pretty pissed about
going into quarantine?

152
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,894
Of course.

153
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,647
But it's better to be safe.

154
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,610
Always better to be safe.

155
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,739
You should talk to him.

156
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,408
We should both pay our respects.

157
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,745
I'll take this up first.
Meet you.

158
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,981
I'm sorry about what happened.

159
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,902
What I did to you.

160
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,197
Everything.

161
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,783
It's on both of us.

162
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,579
You got to find who did this.

163
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,165
I didn't know David much.

164
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,834
Did you?

165
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,713
Did anyone have a problem
with him or Karen?

166
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,716
No. No way.

167
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,593
I was with her
all the time, every day.

168
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,805
She got along with everybody.
Same with David.

169
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,809
They were the only two
who were sick.

170
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,314
The person who did it might have trying
to stop this thing from spreading.

171
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,733
They didn't.

172
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,117
Now Sasha has it.

173
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,622
Look, whoever it was who did this,

174
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,333
they're not going anywhere.
We'll find them.

175
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,377
Today? Right now?

176
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,504
Because I'm not feeling the urgency.

177
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,048
All I see you doing is pumping water.

178
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,720
In fact, what I'm picking up is
murder is okay in this place now.

179
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,014
No, it is not.

180
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,891
But we have to save lives first.

181
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,018
We have to keep this place going.

182
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,062
You worry about that.

183
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,398
I'll worry about what's right.

184
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,696
( coughing )

185
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,098
It's for your own good.

186
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,766
I'm fine.

187
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,643
I don't want to be locked
away with a bunch of kids.

188
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,355
I need you in there keeping an eye
on Judith and everybody else.

189
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,691
Making sure they're safe.

190
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,741
If anybody gets sick,
you let me know.

191
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,994
What if they've already
turned when I find them?

192
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,128
You don't fire
unless you absolutely need to.

193
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,840
But you know
I might need to, right?

194
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,023
It's gonna be okay.

195
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,109
( sighs )
It's gonna be okay.

196
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,612
- Glenn?
- Don't.

197
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,448
- Don't-- don't come in.
- What is it?

198
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,789
I have it.

199
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,520
Son of a bitch
is about a quart low.

200
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,689
You still keep it in
the bottom of tower three?

201
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,441
- Yeah.
- I'll go get one.

202
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,860
Hey.

203
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,113
I'm glad you're here.

204
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,448
Where else would I be?

205
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,867
Running off.

206
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,124
You know I'm not running off.

207
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,010
So it's just gonna be me
and you like in the old days?

208
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,638
Yeah, and Bob.

209
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,141
Still, feels like we
could use another person.

210
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,685
- Who else isn't sick?
- We don't ask Rick.

211
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,521
He wants to stay here
with Carl and Little Ass-Kicker.

212
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,107
Keep them safe.

213
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,985
Plus there's plenty
of stuff he could do here.

214
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,279
So who else we got?

215
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,657
( people coughing )

216
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,456
Oh, there you are.

217
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,042
Took me damn near forever to find you.

218
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,085
Whatcha doing?

219
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,339
Somebody needs to stand watch.

220
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,008
Man, I want to find them, too.

221
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,511
Put a bolt in them for what they did.

222
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,264
( faint coughing )

223
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,851
These people are cut off.

224
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,436
Ain't no way anyone's getting in and out

225
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,146
without a whole bunch
of people seeing 'em.

226
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,024
Sasha's in there.
I ain't going nowhere.

227
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,655
Standing guard ain't gonna do no good
unless we come back with them meds.

228
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,662
All right.

229
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,041
We're gassing up by the front gate
in case you change your mind.

230
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,875
Carl:
Where are you going?

231
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,587
I'm down here away from y'all

232
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:32,134
'cause you kids are supposed
to stay away from me.

233
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,429
I've been walking the halls.
My dad told me to look out for everyone.

234
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,099
Well, you should keep your distance.

235
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,935
You're walking towards the exit.

236
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,479
- I need to go out there.
- To the cell blocks?

237
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,773
To the woods.

238
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,316
So you're sneaking out.

239
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,819
Don't need anyone worrying about me

240
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,655
and I damn sure don't want
someone telling me I can't go.

241
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,699
I can't just let you go out
into the woods by yourself.

242
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,367
Let me?

243
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,203
I can't stop you.

244
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,913
But I have to tell my dad.

245
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,707
Go ahead, then.

246
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,543
I'll be out there
by the time you find him.

247
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,172
Hershel.

248
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,096
If you have to go,
then I have to come with you.

249
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,724
- Carl.
- I have to.

250
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,936
( coughing )

251
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,151
I swear, it's just allergies.

252
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,278
- Jeanette.
- They come and go.

253
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,280
- Jeanette.
- Ask anyone from Woodbury.

254
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,449
Jeanette.

255
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,381
( door squeaks )

256
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,550
( bangs )

257
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,054
Lizzy:
Carol...?

258
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,099
Mica said you were here.

259
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,312
I don't feel good.

260
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,731
( coughs )

261
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,733
It's okay.

262
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,611
Don't worry.

263
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,822
Hey, don't worry.

264
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,199
We're gonna get you better.

265
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,868
You just go in there and lie down.

266
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,287
Will you tuck me in?

267
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,168
You know my friend Glenn?

268
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,212
He's the best tucker I know.

269
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,882
And he'll make sure
that you feel toasty and warm, okay?

270
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,473
( coughing within )

271
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,897
Okay. It's okay.

272
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,483
It's okay.

273
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,152
It's all right. Go on.

274
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,337
Thanks for being in there.

275
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,839
I know you don't have to be.

276
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,259
It means a lot you being
in there with Judith.

277
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,095
Things okay out there?

278
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,391
Glenn has it.

279
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,187
Maggie.

280
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,107
We don't get to be upset.

281
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,695
We all got jobs to do.
That's what Daddy always says.

282
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,073
Daryl and Michonne
will get the meds.

283
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,577
You and Carol and Rick
will help everyone till they get back.

284
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,415
And I'll take care of Judith.

285
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,084
Just focus on what you have to do.

286
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,340
No matter what happens,
we'll deal with it.

287
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,052
We have to.

288
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,776
When did your dad give it back?

289
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,029
Yesterday.

290
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,198
After everything happened.

291
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,244
You've grown a lot
these last few months.

292
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,581
There's a responsibility about you.

293
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:37,253
I think it's done you good
to step back.

294
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,422
Yeah.

295
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,591
It was all right.

296
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,009
Can't be like that all the time.

297
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,262
I would have been fine on my own.

298
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,933
It's peaceful out here.

299
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,645
These last couple days,

300
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,273
we might be safer outside
those walls than in.

301
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,488
No, we're not.

302
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,596
( growling )

303
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,560
( snarls )

304
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,867
Let's wrap this up.

305
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,537
( rattling )

306
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:08,344
Don't.
You don't need to.

307
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,314
It was so peaceful.

308
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,149
It was.

309
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,195
Can't be like that all the time.

310
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,868
( growls )

311
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,042
It's not as bad as it looks.

312
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,128
( panting heavily )

313
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,464
Don't do that.

314
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,300
( sobbing )
Okay.

315
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,594
I must be a sight to see.

316
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,389
I'm so sorry.

317
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,893
- I heard about Karen--
- Don't.

318
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,311
Don't think about that now.

319
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,981
Think about getting better.
Positive thoughts.

320
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,234
Positive vibes.

321
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,572
I don't know.
( sobbing )

322
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,367
Daryl's got a group going out.

323
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,452
They're getting medicine.

324
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,579
Someplace Hershel knew about.

325
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,332
That veterinary college?

326
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,294
- It's far.
- But they feel sure about it.

327
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,716
So we could have medicine
as early as tomorrow.

328
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,594
We've got a chance.

329
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,354
- Ty.
- Get some rest.

330
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,356
I got to go.

331
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,945
Everything look all right?

332
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,947
Yeah.

333
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,032
Zack kept this thing
running pretty good.

334
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,495
This is Zack's car?

335
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,914
Yeah, fastest one we got.

336
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,169
You all right?

337
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,298
You really want me coming along?

338
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,304
What's that word?

339
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,680
"Zanamivir."

340
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,765
Yup, we need you.

341
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,354
- What's up?
- Still got room for one more?

342
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,315
- Hell, yeah.
- Good.

343
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,483
Just got to get my gear.

344
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,156
All right.

345
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,328
( thumps )

346
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,310
( gasps )
Oh, God, I didn't see you there.

347
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,854
- Sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay.

348
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,023
You okay?

349
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,193
I'm going on the run with Daryl.

350
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,695
But I was wondering--

351
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,906
I know there's a lot
of people in trouble.

352
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,075
Sick.

353
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,662
It's just I know how you are.

354
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,914
You care.

355
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,958
Thank you.

356
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,628
I was wondering if you could
look in on Sasha for me.

357
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,715
It would make me feel better
knowing you were looking in on her.

358
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:36,344
- If you can't--
- No.

359
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,680
No, I'd be happy to.

360
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,057
Thank you.

361
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:45,937
Oh, what happened to Karen,
I'm so sorry.

362
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,329
( thumps )

363
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,464
( sobs )

364
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,323
Why aren't you in quarantine?

365
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,415
I'm no good to anyone in there.

366
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,167
Daddy, please.

367
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,961
Maggie, dear,
there are people in there suffering.

368
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:55,048
I can bring their fever down
and keep them stable.

369
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,841
Daryl's getting the antibiotics.

370
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,843
Some of these people
won't last 12 hours.

371
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,637
I can't let you do this.

372
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,515
Maggie, Glenn's in there.

373
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,810
What's going on?

374
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,937
Elderberries.

375
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,106
My wife used to make tea with them.

376
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,983
They're a natural flu remedy.

377
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,320
Caleb's too sick to help. I can.

378
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,989
There's so many times

379
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,576
we haven't been able to do anything
to change what was happening--

380
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,370
what was happening to us.

381
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,664
We wished we could,
but we couldn't.

382
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,834
This time, I can.
I know I can.

383
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,961
So I have to.

384
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,672
Hershel, if you go in there,
you're gonna get sick.

385
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,467
Wait, we don't know that.
What we do know

386
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,136
is that these people's symptoms
need to be controlled.

387
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,888
Hershel, please.
We can wait.

388
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,057
Listen, damn it!

389
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,893
You step outside,
you risk your life.

390
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:52,105
You take a drink of water,
you risk your life.

391
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:56,275
And nowadays you breathe,
and you risk your life.

392
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,029
Every moment now
you don't have a choice.

393
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,409
The only thing you can choose
is what you're risking it for.

394
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,412
Now I can make these people feel better

395
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,872
and hang on a little bit longer.

396
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,625
I can save lives.

397
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,837
That's reason enough to risk mine.

398
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,382
And you know that.

399
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,184
Dad.

400
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,901
( creaking )

401
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,074
( creaking )

402
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,706
Maggie?

403
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,252
Daddy's gone.
He left.

404
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,046
I know.

405
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,216
Did he tell you where he went?

406
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:05,761
No, but... I know.

407
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,764
How?

408
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,434
Dr. S. is sick and...

409
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,066
...we all got jobs to do.

410
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,946
We'll deal with it, right?

411
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,661
We don't get to get upset.

412
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,099
( growling )

413
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,851
( metal rattling )

414
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,915
( walkers snarling )

415
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,103
( banging )

416
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,281
Damn it.

417
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:45,921
Shit.

418
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,090
Carol! Run!

419
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,472
Shit.

420
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,736
Run!

421
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,740
( splashes )

422
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,213
( gunshot )

423
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,436
Piece of cake.

424
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,397
We decided to do that tomorrow.

425
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,358
We don't know if we get a tomorrow.

426
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,041
Daryl:
Hey, I know you weren't running off.

427
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:08,170
The thing is,
that trail went cold.

428
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,090
You know that, right?

429
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,929
If it was any different,

430
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,056
I'd be right out there with you.

431
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,525
( radio static crackles )

432
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,905
Would you hand me one
of them CDs right there?

433
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,368
Faint voice:
...find sanctuary.

434
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,203
- Was that a voice?
- Shh.

435
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,540
...determined to survive...

436
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,711
...Keep alive.

437
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,759
( tires squeal )

438
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,085
( growling )

439
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,088
- Grab something!
- ( wheels screeching )

440
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,598
Go to the left.

441
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,937
We're jammed up.

442
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,105
Make a run for the gaps right there.

443
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,275
You two make a run for the woods
and don't stop for nothing, you hear me?

444
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,652
Now!

445
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,282
Move!

446
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,603
Ty!

447
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,987
Ty!

448
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,248
Go! Come on!

449
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,166
Come on and get me!

450
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,304
Go! Go!

451
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,682
Come on.

452
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,059
Come on and get me!

453
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,995
Daryl:
Go!

454
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,547
Daryl:
Come on.

455
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,509
Hold up.

456
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,981
( growling )

457
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,704
Come on.

458
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,551
( distant coughing )

459
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,721
Drink it.

460
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,776
Hang in there, Doc.

461
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,779
You shouldn't be here.

462
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,572
Tell me you wouldn't be.

463
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,199
( coughing )

464
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,953
( cup clatters )

465
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,749
( coughs )

466
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:26,030
If you weren't in here already,

467
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,574
you'd be in here.

468
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,376
( coughs )

469
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:44,131
I'm fine. I'm fine.

470
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,384
( groans )

471
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,809
Keep this on your forehead.

472
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,187
Veterinarian's orders.

473
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,357
( sighs )

474
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,735
This sucks.

475
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,739
After everything,

476
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,784
we just get taken out
by a glorified cold.

477
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,703
Don't say things like that.

478
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,539
Don't even think things like that.

479
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,210
All I can do is stop saying them.

480
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,420
No, you can do more.

481
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,798
We got this far somehow,

482
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,342
you can believe somehow.

483
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,595
Now we all have jobs here.

484
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,972
That one's yours.

485
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,702
That was a stupid thing you did.

486
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,916
Going out there like that.

487
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,545
Yes, it was.

488
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,015
You know, you do a lot for us,

489
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,309
for the kids.

490
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,565
You sacrifice a lot.

491
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,365
Is there anything you wouldn't do
for the people here?

492
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,745
No.

493
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,419
Carol...?

494
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,846
Did you kill Karen and David?

495
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,476
Yes.

496
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,619
( theme music playing )
