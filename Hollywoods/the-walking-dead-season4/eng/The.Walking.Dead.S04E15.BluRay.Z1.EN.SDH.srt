1
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:04,962
Eugene: I'm well aware
it sounds bananas.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,090
But looking at the fossil record,
knowing what I know

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,175
about this infection,
you cannot say for certain

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,594
it isn't what killed off
the dinosaurs.

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,263
Now, do I believe
that's what happened?

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,140
No.

7
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,976
But it's enjoyable as hell
to think about an undead ankylosaur

8
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,937
going after a diplodocus.

9
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,731
That there is a video game
worth a preorder.

10
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,067
Oh, hell, yeah.
Score.

11
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,278
A few more of those,
a little aluminum foil

12
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,740
and some bleach,
you got yourself some volts, sister.

13
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,909
Homemade battery.

14
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,079
- Here.
- For reals?

15
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,622
You don't want it?

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,290
For reals.

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,126
Much obliged.

18
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,461
Speaking of video games,
what kind of gamer were you?

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,256
RPGs, shmup, sim racing?

20
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,975
( sighs )

21
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,528
Go to sleep.
I got this.

22
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,031
No offense, but I'm not leaving
Eugene's life in your hands.

23
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,200
You came with us
because you wanted help.

24
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,162
You're support,
not point.

25
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,791
We'll move north with you till I find
the right vehicle just off the tracks.

26
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,293
Then five becomes three.

27
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,171
Or two.

28
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,339
We each have
our missions.

29
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,685
You need to get
some sleep.

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,731
I haven't seen you
do it yet.

31
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,361
( chuckles )

32
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,699
Thought it was because
you were in love with him.

33
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,576
( chuckles )

34
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,788
A girl in love with a guy

35
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,540
she's trying to help
get to his girl.

36
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,753
If that were the case...

37
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,217
closing your eyes would be
just too damn tragic.

38
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,886
- If that were the case.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,890
I saw the way you were
looking down Rosita's shirt

40
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,101
while she was
serving you dinner.

41
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,604
Hey, the things
are damn near hypnotic.

42
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,690
( laughs )

43
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,943
Look, Eugene spends
half the day staring at her ass.

44
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,738
I'm not mad, it just means
my theory's shot.

45
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,907
I'm awfully sorry
about that.

46
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,409
Well, I'm right
and I'm wrong.

47
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,247
Something you did
or something you didn't do?

48
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,544
Something I did.

49
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,053
You were in the army.

50
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,097
I get the whole
gung ho,

51
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,391
mission is your life
bullshit.

52
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,309
Yeah, you do.

53
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,478
Yeah.

54
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,898
So we both
got our reasons.

55
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,775
Both got our missions.

56
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,407
What do you do
when the mission's over?

57
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,289
Eugene:
Been rubbing me wrong, is all.

58
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,375
I'm an even-Steven
type gentleman.

59
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,627
You help me find the supplies,
we'll share the battery

60
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,255
and whatever juice we scare up,
minimal as it may be.

61
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,299
Deal?

62
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,550
( theme music playing )

63
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,214
( walker snarling )

64
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,223
( snarling continues )

65
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,144
( cans rattling )

66
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,024
Man:
I got it.

67
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,742
( grunts )

68
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,958
( urinating )

69
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:38,295
Looks like that Robin Hood cat
cut out on us after all.

70
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,716
I didn't think he had the sack
to go out on his own.

71
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,593
He don't.
Dude left his stuff here.

72
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,847
Probably just stepped out
to drop a morning deuce.

73
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,855
I think we got about
a day's worth of water left.

74
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,858
We're lucky it's cooled off
a little bit, but...

75
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,029
What are you doing?

76
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,115
- Winning a bet.
- In your dreams.

77
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,701
I'm still on.

78
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,204
( laughs )
You spoke too soon, wise guy.

79
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,498
This might go on
a while.

80
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,126
Maybe we can
speed this up.

81
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,836
Yeah, you're right.

82
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,796
Shouldn't be
fooling around.

83
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,299
We should probably--
Carl!

84
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,219
I win.

85
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,388
Pay up.

86
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,025
Is that really
the last Big Cat?

87
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,285
Oh, come on.

88
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,580
Hey, but you said
winner's choice.

89
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,833
Go ahead, take it.
It's yours.

90
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,586
You won it
fair and square.

91
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,135
Come on,
we always share.

92
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,181
Fork it over.

93
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,574
( squeals )

94
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,370
What the hell
are you doing?

95
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,122
Catching me
some breakfast.

96
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,082
That's mine.

97
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,835
My arrow's the one
that hit first.

98
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,962
Cottontail
belongs to me.

99
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,133
Been out here since
before the sun came up.

100
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,427
You see, the rules
of the hunt

101
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,721
don't mean jack out here.

102
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,849
Now, that rabbit
you're holding

103
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,518
is claimed, boy.

104
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,731
Claimed whether
you like it or not.

105
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,359
So I was you,
I'd hand it over.

106
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,444
Now before you
get to wishing

107
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,321
you ain't never even
got out of bed this morning.

108
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,115
It ain't yours.

109
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,160
You know, I'll bet

110
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,745
this bitch

111
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,707
got you all
messed up, hmm?

112
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,667
Am I right?

113
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,713
Got you walking around here
like a dead man

114
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,716
who just lost himself
a piece of tail.

115
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,260
Must have been a good'un.

116
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,679
Tell me something.

117
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,891
Was it one
of the little'uns?

118
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,606
'Cause they don't last
too long out here.

119
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,442
- Easy, fellas, easy.
- ( laughing )

120
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,194
Let's just put
our weapons down.

121
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,863
See if we can't figure out
what's really the problem here, huh?

122
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,452
- Did you claim it?
- Hell, yeah.

123
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,706
Well, there you go.
That critter belongs to Len.

124
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,666
So let's have it.

125
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,756
Looks like you may be
wanting an explanation.

126
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:12,426
See, going it alone,
that ain't an option nowadays.

127
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,095
Still, it is survival
of the fittest.

128
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,014
That's a paradox
right there.

129
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,309
So I laid out
some rules of the road

130
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,811
to keep things from going
Darwin every couple hours.

131
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,105
Keep our merry band
together and stress-free.

132
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,776
All you got to do is claim.

133
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,819
That's how you mark
your territory,

134
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,529
your prey,
your bed at night.

135
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,907
One word, claimed.

136
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,284
I ain't claiming nothing.

137
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,578
We're gonna
teach him, right?

138
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,083
The rules say
we got to teach him.

139
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,671
It wouldn't be fair
to punish you

140
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,589
for violating a rule
you never even knew existed.

141
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,508
There ain't
no rules no more.

142
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,177
Oh, there are.
You know that.

143
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,013
That's why I didn't kill you
for the crossbow.

144
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,477
- Hey.
- Easy there, partner.

145
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,658
Claimed.

146
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,035
That's all
you got to say.

147
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,538
Hey, ass end
is still an end.

148
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,598
Hold up!

149
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,310
We're stopping here.

150
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,979
Tired is slow.

151
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,815
- Slow is dead.
- It's barely noon.

152
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
I don't give
a monkey's left nut.

153
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,986
None of us has slept more
than a couple hours straight

154
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,405
since we went
all Casey Jones.

155
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,449
This place looks safe.

156
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,160
We need to rest.

157
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,288
I get it.
You have to find her.

158
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,707
Well, Rosita and me,
we got a mission, too.

159
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,043
It's keeping that man alive,
getting him to Washington,

160
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,462
and saving
the whole damn world.

161
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,548
So we're going in that tower
and we're going now.

162
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,884
( walkers snarling )

163
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,846
- Oh, crap.
- Hey, hey, hey, watch out!

164
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,014
Abraham:
Go, go!

165
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,267
- Go!
- Move! Move!

166
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,692
- Rosita: Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

167
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,111
We got to stay here.
Who's gonna help me carry her up?

168
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,654
- You okay?
- Yeah.

169
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,989
You wanna stop
or you wanna keep going?

170
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,157
No, keep going.
I'm good.

171
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,117
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

172
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:46,121
Look, if she can keep going,
we can all keep going.

173
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,752
Or you guys
can stay here.

174
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,587
You don't need us,
we don't need you.

175
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,465
- It's okay.
- Rosita: Wow, you're an ass.

176
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,469
She will do whatever you say
because she thinks she owes you.

177
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,304
Man up.

178
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,099
Stay here for a few hours.

179
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,686
You just care about
keeping Eugene safe, right?

180
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,231
It's the only reason
you want to stop?

181
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,149
We go until sundown,

182
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,944
I give Eugene my riot gear
right here, right now.

183
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,987
- Everybody wins.
- Except her.

184
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,156
You're not her mama.

185
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,704
She says she can walk,
she can walk.

186
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,044
You got yourself a deal.

187
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,130
Okay.

188
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,845
- So what's the plan, Daryl?
- How so?

189
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,514
You're with us now,
but you ain't soon?

190
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,349
Yep.

191
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,685
So what's the plan?

192
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,357
Just looking for
the right place is all.

193
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,360
Oh, we ain't good
enough for you, huh?

194
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,280
Some of you ain't
exactly friendly.

195
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,617
You ain't
so friendly yourself.

196
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,953
You know you need
a group out here.

197
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,248
- Maybe I don't.
- No, you do.

198
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,208
You should be with us.

199
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,627
( walker snarling )

200
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,298
Joe:
People don't got to be friendly.

201
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,593
We don't have to be nice.
We don't have to be brothers in arms.

202
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,720
( snarling )

203
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,771
We just got
to follow the rules.

204
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,066
You claim.

205
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,110
If you steal,
you keel.

206
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,695
I know that sounds
a little funny,

207
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,697
but nobody laughs
when something goes missing.

208
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,033
And you don't lie.

209
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,994
'Cause that's
a slippery slope indeed.

210
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,246
What happens
if you break 'em?

211
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,417
Oh, you catch a beatin'.

212
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,587
The severity of which
depends upon the offense

213
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,840
and the general attitude
of the day.

214
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,592
But that don't
happen much

215
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,679
'cause when men
like us follow rules

216
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,640
and cooperate
a little bit,

217
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,100
well, the world
becomes ours.

218
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,852
( whistles )
Right there.

219
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,939
It's our abode
for the evening.

220
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,815
Hey.

221
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,609
There ain't no us.

222
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,031
You leaving right now?

223
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,036
No?

224
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,872
Then it sure seems
like there's an us.

225
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,506
You a cat person, Daryl?

226
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,299
I am.

227
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,968
Loved 'em since
I was three years old.

228
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,428
Vicious creatures.

229
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,930
Anyway, I'll tell you,

230
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,765
and this is true,

231
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,017
ain't nothing sadder
than an outdoor cat

232
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,186
that thinks
he's an indoor cat.

233
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,014
We're gaining on 'em.

234
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,932
Still wet.

235
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,810
We sure as Shinola
can't go up and over.

236
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,938
( walkers snarling )

237
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,068
How about around?

238
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,070
No.

239
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,948
That'll take a day,
maybe more.

240
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,492
If Maggie went through,
I'm going through.

241
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,287
- We're close.
- Shut up a second.

242
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,207
- ( snarling continues )
- You hear that?

243
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,628
That there
is a long, dark tunnel

244
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,088
full of reanimated corpses.

245
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,217
I don't have
full-on certainty

246
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,428
that I can get Eugene
through there alive.

247
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,598
My recommendation
would be take the day,

248
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,767
make the detour
and play it safe,

249
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,519
but I know you're not
gonna do that.

250
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,898
So this is where
we've got to part ways.

251
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,608
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,235
You're on your own.

253
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,240
No, you're not.

254
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,245
No, no, no.
Those are yours.

255
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,997
You guys will need them
for your trip.

256
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,041
You will, too.

257
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,965
Thank you.

258
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,559
Sorry, I...

259
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,353
hit you in the face.

260
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,814
I'm not.

261
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,358
I like to fight.

262
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,117
Good luck.

263
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,205
Try not to be an ass.

264
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,632
You're both good people.

265
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,096
I have to say that you
are seriously hot, Tara.

266
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,516
Yeah, I like girls.

267
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,562
I'm well aware of that.

268
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,569
Say you get into
trouble in there.

269
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,821
You turn around.

270
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,990
We're doubling back
to the first road we crossed.

271
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,452
Maybe you find us
before we find the right ride.

272
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,870
Thanks.

273
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,383
Hey.

274
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,177
I know what
you're going through.

275
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,687
After this all started,

276
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,648
after I realized
I'd never see my family,

277
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,067
my friends again,

278
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,111
I was numb.

279
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,322
All day long,
just numb.

280
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,327
I'm just saying
I get it.

281
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,043
When Brian told us
he wanted to take over the prison,

282
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,046
I knew it sounded bad.

283
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,007
When I found my girlfriend,
she was dead.

284
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,592
My niece.

285
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,094
My sister,

286
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,931
she was surrounded,
pounced on.

287
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,558
I saw it happen.

288
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,727
But still, it wasn't
as bad as seeing

289
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,021
what he did
to Maggie's father.

290
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,283
Because that's when I knew.

291
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,374
That second the sword--

292
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,797
I wanted to scream "no,"
but it just happened.

293
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:37,509
Brian said we might
have to kill people.

294
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,178
I was the first
to jump in.

295
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,767
I was just hanging
on the "might."

296
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,882
They ain't here.

297
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,175
Nobody's been here
for a while.

298
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,720
Whoever was,
they got all the gas.

299
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,221
That don't matter.

300
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,973
We're getting closer.
I can feel it.

301
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,434
Claimed.

302
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,146
Claimed.

303
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,316
Claimed.

304
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,862
Claimed.

305
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,031
Claimed.

306
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,634
( walkers snarling )

307
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,267
The blood is still wet.

308
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,937
This had to have
happened today.

309
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,449
Hold this.

310
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,451
Glenn.
What are you doing?

311
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,579
- She's not one of them.
- What?

312
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,334
There's no bodies
on the ground.

313
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,753
That means Maggie
made it through.

314
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,464
She made it through.

315
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,968
We have to
get rid of them.

316
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,346
- We don't have enough ammo.
- Then we'll push through.

317
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,848
We have to find
another way.

318
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,693
( exhales )

319
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,695
( snarling )

320
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,864
( pounding )

321
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,202
You got him?

322
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,746
I got her.

323
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,720
( engine starts )

324
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,806
Gonna need to air
this baby out.

325
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,643
Good, it'll give us some time to figure
out how to get back on track.

326
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,993
- Yo, no, no.
- I'm the navigator.

327
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,287
Then learn to navigate.

328
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,539
Remember Thompson?

329
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:03,668
I'm formally requesting
a straight up do-over on that one.

330
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,838
I guided us here from Houston
to northern Georgia without incident.

331
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,882
I wouldn't say
without incident.

332
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,508
Minimal incident.

333
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,093
Navigation-wise,
at least.

334
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,473
Please?

335
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,517
I cannot abide a reality

336
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,562
where you are the chosen navigator
over a son of the South

337
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,772
who has successfully
negotiated the travails

338
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,275
and vagaries of journeys
both real and virtual.

339
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,451
All right.

340
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,953
We're going north.
Got it?

341
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,000
( snarling )

342
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,676
Tara. What is it?
What is it?

343
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,679
I can't--
( grunting )

344
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,893
Get up, get up,
get up.

345
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,445
Eugene:
Turn left up here.

346
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,947
This is the third
left turn

347
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,241
you've made me make
in the last five minutes.

348
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,535
- You're lost.
- I'm not.

349
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,704
Turn left.

350
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,665
If you're lost,
please just tell me.

351
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,710
The gas in this tank
is worth more than your ego.

352
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,586
If you want to talk
fuel efficiency, we could talk--

353
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,380
We are not rolling up
the windows.

354
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,008
- It smells like a damn carcass in here.
- Stop the van.

355
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,512
Why are we stopping?

356
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,022
Mentiroso.

357
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,441
Ugh, liar!

358
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,859
Nope.

359
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,777
This wasn't your plan?

360
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,571
Why you insisted
on navigating?

361
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,239
Why you told him
to go to sleep?

362
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,450
Nope. I never
claimed otherwise.

363
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,452
Now how about you
apologize for the slander

364
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,203
and we call it square?

365
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,040
What the hell
is wrong with you?

366
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,958
If Glenn and Tara
were still alive

367
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,835
and there were
no significant delays

368
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,671
and they continued traveling
at approximately three miles per hour

369
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,632
and I timed it
correctly in my head,

370
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,384
they might be
somewhere around here.

371
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,095
Those two are not
the priority.

372
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,390
The only priority
is getting you to Washington.

373
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,934
After I save
the world,

374
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,270
I still have to live
with myself.

375
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,774
I'm not leaving
them behind.

376
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,861
Oh!
Son of a bitch!

377
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,906
Why the hell
are we stopped?

378
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,408
If they made it out of that tunnel,
they'd be somewhere around here.

379
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,786
You're kidding me, right?

380
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,497
What's your problem?

381
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,457
- My problem?
- You're the one in the driver's seat.

382
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,584
You're the one who put
your damn foot on the brake.

383
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,545
- He told me to stop.
- You don't stop! You never stop!

384
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,713
I know the rules.

385
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,632
If you know the rules,
the rule is never stop!

386
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,759
- When you stop...
- Guys!

387
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,928
- Guys!
- Both: What?

388
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,933
Len:
You've got to be kidding me.

389
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,644
Christ.

390
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,646
Give it here.

391
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,648
You step back.

392
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,192
My half was in the bag.
Now it's gone.

393
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,153
Now ain't nobody
around here interested

394
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:03,032
in no half a damn cottontail except you.
Ain't that right?

395
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,992
You're the only one
still thinking about that crap.

396
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,912
- Empty your bag.
- I said step back.

397
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,506
Did you take
his rabbit, Daryl?

398
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,550
Just tell me the truth.

399
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,301
I didn't take nothing.

400
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,262
Joe:
What do we got here?

401
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,890
Come on.

402
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,355
- Well, look at that.
- You put that there, didn't you?

403
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,065
When I went out
to take a piss.

404
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,567
- You lied.
- Didn't you?

405
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,445
You lied.
You stole.

406
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,823
- We gonna teach this fool or what, Joe?
- Whoa, whoa.

407
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,742
Now, Daryl says
he didn't take your half of the rabbit.

408
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,494
So we got a little
conundrum here.

409
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,996
Either he's lying,

410
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,457
which is
an actionable offense,

411
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,293
or...
( laughs )

412
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:59,088
you didn't plant it
on him like some pussy,

413
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,049
punk-ass, cheating,
coward cop, did you?

414
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,720
'Cause while that wouldn't be
specifically breaking the rules,

415
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,055
it'd be disappointing.

416
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,224
- It would.
- Mm-hmm.

417
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,727
- I didn't.
- Good.

418
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,396
Well...

419
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,524
- ( groans )
- ...teach him a lesson, gents.

420
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,027
He's a lying sack of shit.
I'm sick of it.

421
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,154
Teach him all the way.

422
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,074
I saw him do it.

423
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,576
Why didn't you try
to stop him?

424
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,246
He wanted to play that out.
I let him.

425
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,582
You told the truth.

426
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,626
He lied.

427
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,544
You understand the rules.

428
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,087
He doesn't.

429
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,673
- ( blows landing )
- ( Len groaning )

430
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,636
Looks like you get
the head, too.

431
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,358
( straining )

432
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,943
( panting )

433
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,281
Go. Go.

434
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,034
Find Maggie.
Go find Maggie.

435
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,994
No, no.

436
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,206
- No.
- Glenn, you can't save me.

437
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,791
( straining )

438
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,709
Even if you got this
off me, I can't run.

439
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,795
And if you help me,
they're gonna get both of us.

440
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,589
There's got to be a way.
There's got to be a different way.

441
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,675
Glenn, they're coming.

442
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,593
I'm not leaving.
I'm not leaving you!

443
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,680
Get out of here!

444
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,390
Go!

445
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,644
No.

446
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:46,279
( gun clicking )

447
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,322
Come on!

448
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,409
- ( engine revving )
- Come on!

449
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,786
- ( tires squeal )
- ( gunfire )

450
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,621
Abraham:
Get down!

451
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,331
( gunfire )

452
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,484
( crying )

453
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,157
Oh, my God.

454
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,419
Hi.

455
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,379
Hi.

456
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,729
God, you are
so beautiful.

457
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,609
- How'd it go?
- End of the tunnel's secure.

458
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,278
If anything tries to come in,
we'll hear in plenty of time.

459
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,238
We didn't get
to officially meet.

460
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,575
Oh, I'm sorry.
Tara, this is Maggie.

461
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,243
- Maggie, Tara.
- Hi.

462
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,245
Hi.

463
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,583
He's a big
fan of yours.

464
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,129
I met Tara on the road.

465
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,507
Couldn't have made it
here without her.

466
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,052
Thank you.

467
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,394
When she heard what I was doing,
she said she had to help me.

468
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,187
She's just
that kind of person.

469
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,957
What's up?

470
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,668
He just said

471
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,421
that he knows
what caused the outbreak.

472
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,216
Yeah.

473
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,886
He does.

474
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,140
Let me guess.
He asked you to go to DC with him?

475
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,892
I'm downright tickled
y'all found each other.

476
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,563
Should spend the rest
of the night celebrating.

477
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,774
Because tomorrow
there's absolutely no reason

478
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,443
why the eight of us
don't stuff ourselves

479
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,194
in that van and head up
to Washington.

480
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,572
Tara:
He's right.

481
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,658
I'm gonna go.

482
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,202
No, he's wrong.

483
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,706
We're 55% of the way
from Houston to Washington.

484
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,958
Up until now, we've had
an armored military vehicle

485
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,501
for transport
and we lost eight people.

486
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,838
- That wasn't our fault.
- They're gone.

487
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,465
Eugene:
I can't imagine we'd have better luck

488
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,050
with that grocery grabber
we picked up.

489
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,802
We're a day's walk
from Terminus.

490
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,846
Who knows what
they've got there?

491
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,182
Rosita:
Look, it couldn't hurt to check.

492
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,600
Load up on supplies,

493
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,728
maybe even recruit
some of them to come with.

494
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:09,398
I'll go with you guys,
but after.

495
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,358
I have to see Terminus.

496
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,196
My brother
could be there.

497
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,239
I got to know.

498
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,825
Me, too.

499
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,911
On both counts.

500
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,415
He tells me
I'm wrong...

501
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:33,005
I listen.

502
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,549
Tomorrow we go
to the end of the line.

503
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,386
Then Washington.

504
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,390
I can't believe it.

505
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,060
I know.
We were right over there.

506
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,729
A whole swarm of them
came at us.

507
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,900
And we didn't have
enough bullets.

508
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,280
I tried to think what you would
do if you were here.

509
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,243
So I just emptied my clip
into the ceiling

510
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,744
and I hoped for the best.

511
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,913
That's unreal.

512
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,748
Kind of like asking
those guys to hold off

513
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,375
saving the world while you go look
for your wife?

514
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:11,085
( laughs )

515
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,420
I'm a persuasive guy.

516
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,256
Yeah.

517
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,708
Whoa, hey.
What are you doing?

518
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,585
Sorry.

519
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,962
This is the only picture
I have of you.

520
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,465
You don't need
a picture of me.

521
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,635
You never will again.

522
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,614
( loud clang )

523
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,003
( door opens )

524
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,671
White Lightning.

525
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,215
Easiest thing to make with the least
amount of supplies.

526
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,342
I'd start slow
if I was you.

527
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,178
Your stomach's probably
emptier than you think.

528
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,556
Mmm.

529
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,725
I ain't been lit
at dawn since

530
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,311
before everything
fell apart.

531
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,189
Fell apart.
I never looked at it like that.

532
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:40,693
Seems to me like things
are finally starting to fall together.

533
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,947
At least for guys
like us.

534
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,533
Living like this,
surviving.

535
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,410
We've been doing this
from the start, right?

536
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:54,123
Getting closer.

537
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,093
You seen this before?

538
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,761
Oh, yeah.

539
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,347
I'll tell you what it is.
It's a lie.

540
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,434
Ain't no sanctuary
for all.

541
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,146
Ain't gonna welcome
guys like you and me with open arms.

542
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,774
Daryl:
So is that where we're headed?

543
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,777
- So now you're asking?
- That's right.

544
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,614
We were in a house
minding our own business

545
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,576
and this walking
piece of fecal matter

546
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,703
was hiding in the home.

547
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,290
Strangled our colleague Lou
and left him to turn.

548
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,959
Lou came at all of us.

549
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,463
He lit out.

550
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,465
We tracked him
to these tracks,

551
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,135
one of those signs, and thus we've
got a destination in mind.

552
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,013
- You see his face?
- Only Tony.

553
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,431
That's enough
for a reckoning.

554
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,479
Claimed.

Hi. I'm Mary.

Looks like you've been
on the road a while.

We have.
