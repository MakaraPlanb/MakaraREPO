1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,586
Beth's voice:
Hey.

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,254
I know it's been a while.

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,465
I'm gonna be honest,

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,717
I forgot about you.

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,513
After the farm,
we were always moving.

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,015
But something happened.

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,059
Something good.

8
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:20,728
Finally.

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,355
We found a prison.

10
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,860
Daddy thinks that we can
make it into a home.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,863
( snarling )

12
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,909
He says we can grow crops
in the field,

13
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,286
find pigs and chickens,

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,540
stop running,
stop scavenging.

15
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,671
Lori's baby
is just about due.

16
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,757
She'll need a safe place
when it comes.

17
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,262
( walker snarling )

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,222
( gun clicks )

19
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,649
The rest of us,

20
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,569
we just need
a safe place to be.

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,827
I woke up in my own bed
yesterday.

22
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,539
My own bed
in my own room.

23
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,916
But I've been keeping
my bag packed.

24
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,920
Keeping my gun close.

25
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,214
I've been afraid
to get my hopes up

26
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,717
thinking we can
actually stay here.

27
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,263
The thing is,
I've been starting to get afraid

28
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,892
that it's easier
just to be afraid.

29
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,273
But this morning
Daddy said something.

30
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,902
If you don't have hope,
what's the point of living?

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,029
( panting )

32
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,741
So I unpacked my bag
and I found you.

33
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,535
So I'm gonna start
writing in you again.

34
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,370
And I'm gonna write
this down now

35
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,623
because you should write
down wishes

36
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,375
to make them come true.

37
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,711
We can live here.

38
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,508
We can live here
for the rest of our lives.

39
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,804
( theme music playing )

40
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,347
We should do something.

41
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,728
We should do something.

42
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,944
We aren't
the only survivors.

43
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,904
We can't be.

44
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,033
Rick, Michonne,
they could be out here.

45
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,953
Maggie and Glenn could have made it
out of A block.

46
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,664
They could've.

47
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,843
You're a tracker.
You can track.

48
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,679
Come on.

49
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,473
The sun will be up soon.
If we head out now, we can--

50
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,981
Fine. If you won't
track, I will.

51
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,132
( birds screeching )

52
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,698
( blows )

53
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,452
Could be Luke's.
Or Molly's.

54
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,746
Whoever they are,
it means they're alive.

55
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:53,125
No. This means they were alive
four or five hours ago.

56
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,086
They're alive.

57
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,204
They picked up
the pace right here.

58
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,748
Got out in a hurry.

59
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,292
Things went bad.

60
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,753
Wouldn't kill you
to have a little faith.

61
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,090
Yeah, faith.
Faith ain't done shit for us.

62
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,051
Sure as hell didn't do
nothing for your father.

63
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,908
They'll be hungry
when we find them.

64
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,223
( sighs )

65
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,793
What?

66
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,628
That ain't
walker blood.

67
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,631
The trail keeps going.

68
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,549
They fought them off.

69
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,346
No. Got walker tracks
all up and down here.

70
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,015
At least a dozen of them.

71
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,351
( twig snaps )

72
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,779
- ( snarling )
- ( gasping )

73
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,545
( panting )

74
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,305
Come on.

75
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,275
( flies buzzing )

76
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,288
( Beth crying )

77
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,823
Beth's voice:
We're not gonna die.

78
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,202
None of us.

79
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,206
I believe now.

80
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,334
I believe for Daddy.

81
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,419
If this doesn't work,

82
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,297
I don't know how
I could keep going.

83
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,100
( crying )

84
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,771
Don't cry.

85
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,358
I want Carol.

86
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,694
Well, she's not here.

87
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,031
Here, put this
on your belt.

88
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,204
It's gonna get dark soon.
Where are we going?

89
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,711
Farther.
Come on.

90
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,048
Is everybody dead?

91
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,536
- ( crying )
- They're gonna hear her.

92
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,583
We shouldn't be out here.

93
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,169
We'll find a safe
place soon.

94
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,046
We will.

95
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,345
Here.

96
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,890
( crying stops )

97
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,312
- ( leaves rustling )
- Walkers!

98
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,444
Here, come on.

99
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,238
Let's go.
It's okay.

100
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,033
I'll find you
something to eat.

101
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,118
All right, go.

102
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,669
( Judith crying )

103
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,214
Look, grapes.

104
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,299
It's okay.

105
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,636
- Can we eat them?
- Yeah, they're good.

106
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,768
Here, Lizzie,
have some.

107
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,315
Shh.

108
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,317
- Come on, baby girl.
- ( fussing )

109
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,444
Shh.

110
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,949
Lizzie, hand me a diaper.

111
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,034
- ( crying )
- It's okay. All right.

112
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,536
Bear with me, Judith.

113
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,123
Okay, that's it.
Okay.

114
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,544
Mica:
They're gonna hear her.

115
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,087
( crying continues )

116
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,173
You're all right.
Come on.

117
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,427
It's all right.
I know. I know.

118
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,846
All right,
what do you want?

119
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,306
What do you want, hmm?

120
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,352
Shh. Shh.
Okay, come on.

121
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,771
- Shh.
- ( leaves rustling )

122
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,399
- They're coming!
- Ah! I heard it, Mica!

123
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,609
Don't yell at her.
She doesn't understand walkers.

124
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,862
You're the one who
doesn't understand them.

125
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,406
Come on.

126
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,199
Watch the baby.

127
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,368
( crying continues )

128
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,547
- ( wings flapping )
- ( gasps )

129
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,384
Mica!

130
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,387
Mica!

131
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,349
Mica!

132
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,688
- Tyreese: Mica.
- She's gone.

133
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,482
You yelled at her
and now she's gone.

134
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,775
Mica.

135
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,321
Mica.

136
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,410
Are you okay?

137
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,662
I got scared.

138
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,165
That's okay.
We all get scared.

139
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,375
You did the right thing
running.

140
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,085
- What?
- She did.

141
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,421
You hear or see
a walker, you run.

142
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,256
But when you're
in a group,

143
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,926
you got to try to stay
close to them, okay?

144
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,141
You're bleeding.
Did I hurt your arm bad?

145
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,977
It was a lot worse
at the prison. No big.

146
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,189
I'm sorry.

147
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,900
I know I'm not
like Lizzie.

148
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,278
Don't be sorry.
You each do things your own way.

149
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,156
- But you both get it done.
- Like you and Sasha?

150
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,699
You're not like Sasha.

151
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,284
Why not?

152
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,786
Because you're
still here.

153
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,454
Sasha isn't.

154
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,208
( woman screaming )

155
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,588
- Here.
- What are you doing?

156
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,132
Come on.

157
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,552
I'm making sure you can see
in both directions.

158
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,137
You stay like this
and keep watch.

159
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,306
- You're leaving us?
- ( woman screams )

160
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,183
They may be
from the prison.

161
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,561
- I need to help them.
- We need you.

162
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,397
Mica, tuck your shirt
behind your knife

163
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,274
so it's easier to grab.

164
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,984
- We'll be okay.
- Okay.

165
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,986
( woman screams )

166
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,322
What do you do
when you see a walker?

167
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,907
- Run.
- Run.

168
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,994
Together, towards me.
Only fire if you have to.

169
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,121
You stay right here
until I get back, okay?

170
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,872
Please, please don't go.

171
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,294
Mica, look at me.

172
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,546
You can handle this.

173
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,715
You're tough.

174
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,179
( woman screams )

175
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,689
( walkers snarling )

176
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,155
- Chris, head for the woods.
- I can't.

177
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,500
( Judith crying )

178
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,506
Come on, Judith.
Be quiet.

179
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,344
She's not stopping.
Please, Lizzie, do something.

180
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,347
They're gonna hear us.

181
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,559
- Shh.
- ( muffled crying )

182
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,863
( leaves rustling )

183
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,032
( snarling )

184
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,284
Lizzie.

185
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,580
- Ah! Dad!
- Christopher!

186
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,166
- Dad!
- Christopher!

187
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,552
( Mica muffled )
Lizzie, we have to run.

188
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,346
( Judith crying, muffled )

189
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,264
Mica:
Lizzie?

190
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,059
Lizzie.

191
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,276
( gunshot )

192
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,289
- Watch out!
- ( screams )

193
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,511
Carol:
Tyreese.

194
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,772
How-- how...

195
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,449
How'd you find us?

196
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,576
Where were you?
How'd you--

197
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,162
( man sobbing )

198
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,414
Stay here, girls.

199
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,427
Stay on the tracks.

200
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,222
That was my mistake.

201
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,349
But the woods have
more cover.

202
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,895
No, you don't
understand.

203
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,939
There's a place
up the tracks.

204
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,610
It's safe.
You can take the children there.

205
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,948
Trust me.

206
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,367
Please.

207
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,578
Follow the tracks.

208
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,386
( sobbing )

209
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,684
Tyreese.

210
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,728
I didn't run.

211
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,855
I didn't leave Lizzie.

212
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,733
See that?
Tough little lady.

213
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:18,198
Hey, there's some
water in there.

214
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,617
- And some food.
- Yeah.

215
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,914
Here you go.

216
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,584
Here you go.
Here you go.

217
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,672
I didn't see
you get out.

218
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,091
I thought you--

219
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,593
I wasn't there.

220
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,721
I hadn't
gotten back yet.

221
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,223
Rick and I found a car.

222
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,433
He took what we had
back to the prison

223
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,103
while I...

224
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,938
kept looking.

225
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,816
Did you see it?

226
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,527
I saw the end.

227
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,321
And then...

228
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,448
I saw you running
into the woods.

229
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,117
You were far away.
I lost you, but...

230
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,995
You found us.

231
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,457
I knew you would.

232
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,133
Hey, maybe we can circle
back and find your car.

233
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,178
The walkers
and the fire--

234
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,848
you can't go back
to a graveyard.

235
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,984
Look.

236
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,828
"Sanctuary for all.
Community for all.

237
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,831
Those who arrive
survive."

238
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:21,279
( knife scraping )

239
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,657
( fabric ripping )

240
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,374
Sorry.

241
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,878
You can smile.

242
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,339
You're alive.
I get it.

243
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,927
That's not it.

244
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,555
Okay.

245
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,394
Tyreese could have
made it, Sasha.

246
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,523
We don't know
if anybody got out.

247
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,404
No.

248
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,490
We do.

249
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,168
How's he doing?

250
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,088
Bleeding stopped.
He'll be all right.

251
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,759
Got the water
to our backs.

252
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,302
Decent vantage points
from the bank.

253
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,263
I'm thinking we camp
here for the night.

254
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,432
That's good.

255
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,603
You should both
be safe here.

256
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,689
The bus got out.
Glenn got out.

257
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,191
- I'm gonna find him.
- Maggie.

258
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,070
With any luck,
the bus is gone.

259
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,614
It was heading east down the main road.
If I follow in that direction,

260
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,576
- I might be able to pick up its tracks.
- Alone? With just that?

261
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,786
I'm out of ammo, so, yeah.

262
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,747
I couldn't find Beth.

263
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,999
I know Glenn got out
and I know which way he went.

264
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,710
I'm gonna go get him
and I'm gonna come back for you.

265
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,503
- We both are.
- Sasha: Maggie.

266
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,506
- I'm going.
- We cannot split up. Not now.

267
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,968
I'm going.

268
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,890
You said it.

269
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,351
We can't split up.

270
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,819
Sasha:
You could have helped me stop her.

271
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,492
If you're trying to make me
feel sorry for you, it's not working.

272
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,246
Damn, it means I let myself
get shot up for nothing.

273
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,665
The odds of us
finding him...

274
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,835
We should be out
looking for food, shelter.

275
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,504
Yeah, why is that?

276
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,547
So we can live.

277
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,592
- Then what?
- What?

278
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,345
Maybe we didn't survive
just to keep surviving.

279
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,305
Shit happens.

280
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,265
Not everything
has to mean something.

281
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,684
No, it doesn't have to,
but it can.

282
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,562
If you make it that way, and that's
what it seems like we're doing.

283
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,648
And I'm down with that.

284
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,880
Maggie.
Maggie!

285
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,399
( snarling )

286
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,913
You should go.

287
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,084
- Maggie, stop.
- Maggie. Maggie.

288
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,961
I have to know
if he's in there.

289
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,048
Fine, but we
do it together.

290
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,342
Smart.

291
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,137
We'll let them out
one at a time.

292
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,310
Two of us should be
at the door...

293
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,938
in case they stack up
against it.

294
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,191
I have to be here.

295
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,193
I need to see their faces.

296
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,361
- ( pounding )
- ( snarling )

297
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,773
( knife thuds )

298
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,656
I can't hold it.

299
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,914
( muffled gunshots,
knife pierces )

300
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,421
( growling )

301
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,090
( gunshot )

302
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,742
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,005
But they got away.

304
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,965
They were good people.

305
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,551
All of them.

306
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,780
You should let me.

307
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,452
( flies buzzing )

308
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,066
( gurgling )

309
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,865
( snarling )

310
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,846
( growling )

311
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,203
( crying )

312
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,972
( laughing )

313
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,937
( walkers growling )

314
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,197
( groans )

315
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,807
Maggie?

316
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,689
Maggie!

317
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,840
( door squeaks )

318
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,181
( bottle clinks )

319
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,941
( coughs )

320
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,888
( sighs )

321
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,021
( crying )

322
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,837
( sighs )

323
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,464
( sniffles )

324
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,207
( walkers growling )

325
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,555
( Glenn shouting )

326
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,726
( shouts )

327
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,442
( breathing heavily )

328
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,257
( snarling )

329
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,133
( knife pierces )

330
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:41,824
It's full.

331
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,326
Did you even fire a shot?

332
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,789
All right.
Let's go.

333
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,333
Let's go.

334
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,964
Are you just gonna
stay here, huh?

335
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,925
- You're just gonna die?
- I was part of this.

336
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,304
I know.

337
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,140
So what are you doing?

338
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,476
I need your help.

339
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,861
We're gonna run
out of bullets.

340
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,739
Take this
and take this.

341
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,871
- ( lighter clinks )
- Back up.

342
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,558
All right.
I need you to stay ahead of me, okay?

343
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,436
All right.
I'll cover you, but I can't do it alone.

344
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,072
You ready?

345
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,907
Let's go.

346
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,535
Go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

347
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,623
- ( gunshots )
- Shoot! Shoot! Come on!

348
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,385
( gunshot )

349
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,235
( panting )

350
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,323
Did you see if any
of my people got out?

351
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,326
All I saw was my sister
in that field.

352
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,955
She wasn't supposed
to be there.

353
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,709
She had a gun,
but they just swarmed her.

354
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,088
She wasn't
supposed to be there.

355
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,216
I did it for him.
I trusted him.

356
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,385
And then he just
killed that old man.

357
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,722
Hershel?

358
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,186
Was his name Hershel?

359
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,447
I'm sorry.

360
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,365
I'm so sorry.

361
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,788
Brian, that man,
told us you were bad people.

362
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,874
I know it's not true.

363
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,502
I can see it's not,
so what we did, what I did...

364
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,549
I mean, I'm a piece
of shit.

365
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,052
Why would you
want my help?

366
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,182
I don't want it,
I need it.

367
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,396
I have to find Maggie.

368
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,027
Who's Maggie?

369
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,030
She's my wife.

370
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,241
You guys got separated?

371
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,078
I was on the bus and then I got off
to help and she didn't see me.

372
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,164
How do you know
if she made it?

373
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,666
I don't know.

374
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,169
But Hershel,

375
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,588
Maggie's father,
was a great man.

376
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,925
And he told me all I had to do
was believe,

377
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,718
and that's what
I'm gonna do.

378
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,970
Neither one of us
should be alive right now.

379
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,559
She got out, so you're gonna
help me find her.

380
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,480
Things aren't over.

381
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,440
They're not over.

382
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,193
I want to believe that.

383
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,656
I want to.

384
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,369
( walkers growling )

385
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,088
You have to.

386
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,112
( gasping )

387
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,327
Glenn.
Glenn.

388
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,414
Hey, Glenn.

389
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,916
( snarling )

390
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,921
( vehicle approaching )

391
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,017
( panting )

392
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,397
Hope you enjoyed
the show, assholes.

393
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,482
( doors open )

394
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,991
You got a damn mouth
on you, you know that?

395
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,953
What else you got?

396
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,834
( theme music playing )
