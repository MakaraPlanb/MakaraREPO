1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,296
( walkers snarling )

2
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,817
( snarling )

3
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,923
Do not fire
that weapon.

4
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,887
( chuckles )
Shit.

5
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,306
Look at what we got here.

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,234
Oh, honey, look at you.

7
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,653
You're a damn mess.

8
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,449
Damn it.

9
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,409
Shit.

10
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,418
Can I borrow
that a sec?

11
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,003
Thanks.

12
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,632
Oh, I'm not leaving
you out.

13
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,096
There's some rags
in the back.

14
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,854
What?

15
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,691
- What?
- Never seen that before.

16
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,656
I've seen you
do the same thing.

17
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,408
You smiled.

18
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,827
You were smiling.

19
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,291
Well, I'm the...

20
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,628
luckiest guy in the world.

21
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,299
How about you help me
with one of these cars?

22
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,551
We got some miles to go.

23
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,139
( theme music playing )

24
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,973
( laughs )

25
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,188
Do you have something to say
about my extremely comfortable

26
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,524
and attractive shirt?

27
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,777
No, no, no.
It looks great.

28
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,448
Oh, you missed a...

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,166
I wish we had
some soy milk.

30
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,626
Seriously?

31
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,712
Yes, seriously.

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,130
Have you ever tried it?

33
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,340
My best friend
in third grade,

34
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,551
- he was allergic to dairy.
- Uh-huh.

35
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,804
And every day he would bring
this soy stuff to lunch.

36
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,514
- I tried it.
- And?

37
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,975
- I threw up.
- Oh, yeah, right.

38
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,352
All right, all right.
I almost threw up.

39
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,105
But I was like, ugh.

40
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,399
- ( laughs )
- It was so gross.

41
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,694
I mean, literally,
I would rather have powdered milk

42
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,738
than to have to drink
that stuff again.

43
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,198
I would rather have
Judith's formula--

44
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,873
I'm gonna go
finish my book.

45
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,208
I have a couple
chapters left.

46
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,101
Thank you.

47
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,439
I heard him
laughing in there.

48
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,110
Almost forgot
what that sounded like.

49
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,200
I can't be his father
and his best friend.

50
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,453
He needs you.

51
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,373
I know that's a lot
to throw at you.

52
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,291
So if you're ever feeling
like you need a break...

53
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,627
I'm done taking breaks.

54
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,634
So what's the plan?

55
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,846
This place,

56
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,057
is it home

57
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,351
or just a stop
along the way?

58
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,023
Well, let's--

59
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,777
let's just stay here
while we figure it out.

60
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,745
Well, we'll need
more supplies.

61
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,288
I'll go with Carl
and get some.

62
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,541
I'll come, too.

63
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,668
You were unconscious
yesterday.

64
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,005
- I'm awake today.
- We need you strong.

65
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,718
Just rest.

66
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,886
Just one more day.

67
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,947
How long you think
you'll be?

68
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,200
Fill a couple bags,
shouldn't be too long.

69
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,370
It's 8:15 now.

70
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,372
We'll be back
by noon.

71
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,541
All right,
you follow her lead.

72
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,877
You understand?

73
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,673
Hey.

74
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,884
Everything okay?

75
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,095
Yeah, I'm just...

76
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,139
hungry.

77
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,059
All right.

78
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,227
I'll see you
in a couple hours.

79
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,598
( grunts )

80
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,039
( ticking )

81
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,481
Find anything good?

82
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,317
Candy bars?

83
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,946
Comic books?

84
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,160
Crazy Cheese?

85
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,828
Huh?

86
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,415
Bam, Crazy Cheese.

87
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,542
Found it still sealed
and everything.

88
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,669
Now I'll be nice
and let you have the first pull.

89
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,713
No, thanks.

90
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,798
Are you sure?

91
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,009
I'm fine.

92
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,221
You don't seem fine.

93
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,436
I'm just tired.

94
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,479
Okay?

95
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,701
( squirting )

96
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,373
( hisses )

97
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,139
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,476
I'm not very good
at making boys your age laugh.

99
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,563
- ( knocks )
- I was laughing.

100
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,608
Inside.

101
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,236
( knocks )

102
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,821
Toddlers
find me funny.

103
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,449
Two, three-year-olds.

104
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,576
( knocking )

105
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,247
What do you mean
toddlers?

106
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,668
I had
a three-year-old son

107
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,462
and he happened to find me
extremely funny.

108
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,385
( door opens )

109
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,281
We need food, batteries, water,
in that order.

110
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,616
Why didn't you ever
tell me you had a kid?

111
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,453
What was his name?

112
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,082
Did you have
any others?

113
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,917
Were you married?

114
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,005
Okay.

115
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:35,426
I'll answer
one question at a time,

116
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,095
one room at a time,

117
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,264
and only after
we've cleared it.

118
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,066
- ( man grunts )
- Man #2: You're a coward.

119
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,485
- Man: No, I'm sorry.
- Man #2: You're a lying coward.

120
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,322
- That's all you'll ever be.
- Man: No, please, I'm sorry.

121
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,074
- Don't do this, please.
- Man #2: What the hell'd you say to me?

122
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,328
- Man: I said don't do this.
- Man #2: This ain't your business.

123
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,246
- Man: I'm sorry, man.
- Man #2: Aw, shut up.

124
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,124
- Man: I'm so sorry. No, don't.
- Man #2: It's gonna happen.

125
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,584
Man: We can work this out.
Please, don't do this.

126
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,960
Man #2: It's gonna happen.

127
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,879
Man: No, no, no, please.
Please don't. Please!

128
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,839
- ( blow lands )
- ( man screams )

129
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,009
( men laughing )

130
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,349
( man screaming )
Oh, God!

131
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,684
Man #3: You plan on
finishing the job?

132
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,853
- Man #2: Yeah.
- Man #4: I'm getting an earache

133
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,897
and I know he's just gonna
let his ass squeal.

134
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,399
Man #2: After what he did,
the man deserves to bleed.

135
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,776
( footsteps approaching )

136
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,320
Man #4: Y'all stay down
there if you want.

137
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,906
( footsteps approaching )

138
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,247
( indistinct chatter )

139
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,098
( door opens )

140
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,688
- ( footsteps approach )
- ( chattering continues )

141
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,934
( watch ticking )

142
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,944
( ticking stops )

143
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,405
( floorboards creak )

144
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,913
( banging )

145
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,134
- ( bed squeaks )
- ( man sighs )

146
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,306
Man: This will be our
abode for the evening.

147
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,892
Clean up your mess,
Harley.

148
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,822
What was your son's name?

149
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,658
I said after.

150
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,621
Well, these are actually
two separate rooms

151
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,540
and we already cleared
that one, so...

152
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,838
Andre.

153
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,259
His name was
Andre Anthony.

154
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,892
Make sure there isn't
box of cookies hiding in there.

155
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,563
Did you have
any other kids?

156
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,191
Rules of the game,
my friend.

157
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,698
So?

158
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,367
Did you?

159
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,954
( scoffs )
You know, you could be a spy.

160
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,997
Or a cop.

161
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,585
( sighs )

162
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,462
No.

163
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,340
One was enough for me.

164
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,051
And Andre was a handful,
like you.

165
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,430
Does this hallway
count as a room?

166
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,100
If you can find
something we can use.

167
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,580
This is the only thing
I could find.

168
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,582
Does it count?

169
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,917
Technically, yes.

170
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,505
So?

171
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,844
How long has it been?

172
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,434
It happened after--

173
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,854
you know, after
everything happened.

174
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,609
Does my dad know?

175
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,944
Never told him.

176
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,490
Never told anyone

177
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,452
till just now.

178
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,294
Your secret
is safe with me.

179
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,174
It's not really a secret.

180
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,637
It's still safe with me.

181
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,359
( sighs )

182
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,475
( breathing heavily )

183
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,734
Michonne?

184
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,990
Everything okay?

185
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,159
Yeah, it's fine.

186
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,708
There's a baby in there.

187
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,169
It's a dog.

188
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,685
My dad let me name her.

189
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,527
Maybe--

190
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:01,533
maybe her and Andre
are together somewhere.

191
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,588
Come on.

192
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,715
It's almost noon.

193
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,218
Your dad will wonder
where we are if we're late.

194
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,060
( man snoring )

195
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,316
- ( indistinct chatter )
- ( footsteps approaching )

196
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,781
- ( snoring continues )
- Yo.

197
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,909
( knocking )

198
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,703
Comfy?

199
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,248
You waking me up
to see if I'm comfortable?

200
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,708
I want to lie down.

201
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,919
Two other bedrooms
up here to choose.

202
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,922
Them's kids' beds.

203
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,215
I want this one.

204
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,427
- It's claimed.
- I didn't hear it.

205
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,096
You gonna have to lay
claim somewhere else.

206
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,560
( both grunting )

207
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,521
( punches landing )

208
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,191
( groans )

209
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,618
( groans, coughs )

210
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,496
Len!
Len, stop!

211
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,169
Stop, Len!

212
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,171
- Stop!
- Hell, no.

213
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,923
Stop!

214
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,802
( Len panting )

215
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,106
My bed now, jackoff.

216
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,400
( bed creaks )

217
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,823
( groans )

218
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,076
( sighs )

219
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,323
Hey, don't move.

220
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,534
Here's some water.

221
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,580
Where are we?

222
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,123
I don't know.

223
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,375
We were fighting biters
and you passed out

224
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,753
right after we left the prison.
I didn't know what to do.

225
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,422
The back of the truck seemed safer
than the side of the road.

226
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,175
Hey, hey.
Hey.

227
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,595
Did we pass a bus?

228
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,347
On the road,
did we pass a bus?

229
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,725
Yeah.

230
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,810
What did you see?

231
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,775
What did you see?

232
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,736
They were all dead.

233
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,325
How long since
we passed it?

234
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,911
Three hours.

235
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,083
- Hey.
- ( tapping )

236
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,460
Hey, stop the truck.

237
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,007
Hey, numbnuts,
stop the truck.

238
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,719
Stop the truck!

239
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,306
Stop the truck!

240
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,700
Where the hell
are you going?

241
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,619
Where the hell
is he going?

242
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,621
I don't know what your
lady friend's told you

243
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,248
about the special nature
of the mission we're on,

244
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,749
but this shit
is time-sensitive

245
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,501
and we're already
way behind schedule.

246
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,337
So I need you to turn your ass around
and get back in the truck.

247
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,882
- I gotta go.
- It seems like neither one of you's

248
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,175
been paying
close enough attention

249
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,219
to the hell on
earth we've been living in.

250
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,387
So let me tell you how
to best avoid

251
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,472
winding up just another
dead-alive prick.

252
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,268
You find some strong,
like-minded comrades

253
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,020
and you stay stuck together
like wet on water.

254
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,648
We need people.

255
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,693
The more the better.
We need each other, partner.

256
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,195
Even with all that gear on your
shoulder, you won't last a night.

257
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,447
Not by yourself.

258
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,658
I'll take my chances.

259
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,785
I'm gonna have to insist

260
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,163
that you hold the hell up.

261
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,956
All right,
believe it or not,

262
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,375
the fate of the entire
damn human race

263
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,878
might depend on it.

264
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,341
What the hell
are you talking about?

265
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,595
Who is this guy?

266
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,221
I'm Sergeant Abraham Ford.

267
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,807
And these are my companions
Rosita Espinosa

268
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,059
and Dr. Eugene Porter.

269
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,188
We're on a mission to get
Eugene to Washington, DC.

270
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,857
Eugene's a scientist

271
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,027
and he knows exactly
what caused this mess.

272
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,373
All right.

273
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,542
So what happened?

274
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,378
It's classified.

275
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,174
He'd been talking
to the muckety-mucks in Washington

276
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,468
on his satellite phone.

277
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,720
The past couple weeks,

278
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,306
nobody's been picking up
on the other end.

279
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,226
We saw how you handled
those corpses back there.

280
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,772
We could use your help.

281
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,614
Sorry.

282
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,581
I had to get us
off that road.

283
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,959
You were passed out,
we were out of bullets.

284
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,378
I know how to get
back to that bus.

285
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,964
I wrote down
every turn.

286
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,842
I will get you back
if I can, okay?

287
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,803
That's where
she'd go to find me.

288
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,430
- That's where I'm gonna go.
- It's a waste of time.

289
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,183
Tara told us
what went down.

290
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,103
There is zero chance
you will ever find your wife again.

291
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,105
Alive or dead.

292
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,524
Mainly because,
sorry to tell you,

293
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,651
she's gone.

294
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,073
No need for you
to die, too.

295
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,493
Now, come on.

296
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,079
Get back in the truck.
Do something with your life.

297
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,792
( pack drops )

298
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,592
When the people
we love kick...

299
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,265
well, they disappear.

300
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,520
Doesn't mean you've got
to go out that way, too.

301
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,028
( grunts )

302
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,950
She's alive
and I'm gonna find her.

303
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,161
You son of a bitch!

304
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,537
- ( shouts )
- ( grunts )

305
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,831
- Tara: Hey, hey, hey!
- Rosita: Abraham!

306
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,833
Hey, get off him.

307
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,918
Come on.

308
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,172
You don't want this,
Abraham.

309
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,008
Glenn:
Let me go!

310
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,636
- Rosita: Abraham!
- Tara: Stop!

311
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,514
( snarling )

312
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,518
Hey. Hey!

313
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,687
- Hey!
- Rosita: Abraham!

314
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,693
- Hey, get--
- ( Glenn shouts )

315
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,865
- ( snarling )
- ( fighting continues )

316
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,535
Hey, hey, hey!
Come here!

317
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,413
( growling )

318
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,052
Tara: Stop!

319
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,846
( gunfire )

320
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,228
Eugene!
Stop firing, damn it!

321
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,897
Stop firing!
We need to get our weapons.

322
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,525
( gunfire continues )

323
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,901
Rosita:
Leave 'em!

324
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,153
Glenn:
Hey, give me a gun.

325
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,239
Give me a gun.

326
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,799
( gas spilling )

327
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,771
Son of a dick.

328
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,734
- ( ball bouncing )
- ( man snoring )

329
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,412
( men chatting )

330
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,005
( gasps )

331
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,884
Man: Tony, Len, get your
asses down here.

332
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,015
( ball bouncing )

333
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,934
Yo, you hear me?

334
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,535
( clattering )

335
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,991
Man:
Claim, claim, claim!

336
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,411
Len: Shut the hell up.
I'm trying to sleep.

337
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,246
Man #2: There's a woman
shacking up in here.

338
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,748
- Len: Say what?
- Man #3: Come on down.

339
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,417
Len: She hot?

340
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,835
Man #4: Don't grab
your pecker just yet.

341
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,712
She ain't here.

342
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,757
Len: What the hell
you hollering about?

343
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,426
Man #2:
Found her shirt.

344
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,970
Must have washed it
this morning.

345
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,431
- Man #3: Smells good.
- Oh, you found a shirt?

346
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,391
She could be miles
away by now.

347
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,602
Man #2: Why'd she go
to all the trouble of washing a shirt

348
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,437
if she's just
gonna ditch it?

349
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,522
- She'll be back.
- Len: I call first when she gets here.

350
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,399
Man #5: Who knows who else
she got with her.

351
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,151
We need to be ready
for anything.

352
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,279
- Len, take the side room.
- Hold on, let me get a gun.

353
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,282
I'll watch the front den,
you've got the other side room.

354
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,285
- I thought Tony got that.
- Where the hell is Tony?

355
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,704
Tony!

356
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,581
Get him the hell up.

357
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,750
( grunts )

358
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,401
( choking )

359
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,076
( panting )

360
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,055
( men chatting )

361
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,089
( door opens )

362
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,306
( ball bouncing )

363
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,772
Abraham: We were running
a convoy in one of these.

364
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,690
Coming up a dune,
there's this camel,

365
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,526
looks like
it's about to puke.

366
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,320
Probably because
shitbird's packed

367
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,156
about four pounds
of C-4 up its ass.

368
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,116
We were within 20 feet
of that blast

369
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,161
that sent that animal's hump
half a klick into the desert.

370
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,164
And we drove home.

371
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,626
So you tell me
how in the holy hell

372
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,170
did you possibly
kill this truck?

373
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,340
A fully amped-up state

374
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,009
and an ignorance
of rapid-firing weapons.

375
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,599
Is this yours?

376
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,694
Sorry about your ride.

377
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:39,196
Hope you guys
make it to Washington.

378
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,457
Wait for me.

379
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,546
( sighs )

380
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,341
What the hell else
are we gonna do?

381
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,468
Go to Washington.

382
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,723
Fix the whole
damn world!

383
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,437
That way's clear.
Who knows what's north.

384
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,440
We'll find another vehicle.
We'll go with them until we do.

385
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,402
Trust me.
I'm smarter than you.

386
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,234
( ball bouncing )

387
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,218
( spits )

388
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,562
( whistles )

389
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,738
Come on.

390
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,176
- ( walker snarls )
- ( man screaming )

391
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,221
- Man #2: Stop her!
- Son of bitch.

392
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,598
- Man #3: Kill her! Kill her!
- ( gunshots )

393
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,643
( men shouting )

394
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,771
Go! Go!

395
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,858
( shouting and gunfire
continue )

396
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,706
Abraham:
Got to hand it to him.

397
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,542
He's a persistent
son of a bitch.

398
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,713
I get why you're
following him.

399
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,673
You're loyal.

400
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,051
You're a good person.

401
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,219
I like it.

402
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,972
But what we're doing--

403
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,561
I don't know
how else to say it--

404
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,898
saving the world
is just--

405
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,650
( chuckles )
is just more important.

406
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,740
I mean, even if he does
find his wife,

407
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,326
so what?

408
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,912
How long do you think
they'll live happily ever after

409
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,414
if we don't get Eugene
up to Washington?

410
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,166
You think because
I'm following Glenn,

411
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,918
that makes me a good person?

412
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,836
I'm not.

413
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,172
( laughs )

414
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,174
You're good.

415
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,676
You don't know
anything about me.

416
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,471
Just like I don't know anything
about why you're going to Washington.

417
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,182
I get why
Eugene's going.

418
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,600
He's the only one that
knows how to end this.

419
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,729
And Rosita, she loves you.
She'd follow you anywhere.

420
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,816
But why the hell you agreed to drive him
halfway across the country...

421
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,443
It's that hard to believe,
I want to save the world?

422
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,612
Because you're
a good person?

423
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,533
You don't have
to tell me why.

424
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,743
Just don't lie to me.

425
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,513
Crazy Cheese?

426
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,956
What do you think?

427
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,504
Let's go.

428
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,510
Let's go.

429
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,622
( theme music playing )
