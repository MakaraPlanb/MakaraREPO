1
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,852
( walkers snarling )

2
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,116
Hi, Daddy.

3
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,369
You're a sight
for sore eyes.

4
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,291
- Doing okay?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,210
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,588
- Any trouble?
- No.

7
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,801
- You had some.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,511
A little.

9
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,892
Carol,
I'll take that.

10
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,785
( theme music playing )

11
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,871
How hungry are you,
scale of one to 10?

12
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,540
15.

13
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,209
28.

14
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,837
( chuckles )
Yeah.

15
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,881
Well, it's been a while.

16
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,675
I'm gonna go
check the snares.

17
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,261
Can I go with you?

18
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,181
Well, how else
are you gonna learn?

19
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,104
Hey, you, too.

20
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,201
Rick:
We'll stay another day or two.

21
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,954
Get some more rest.

22
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,290
Finish healing up?

23
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,584
I'm almost there.

24
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,255
We're close now, right?

25
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,840
To Terminus?

26
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,717
- Yeah.
- We are.

27
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,847
When we get there,

28
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,349
are we gonna tell them?

29
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,226
Tell them what?

30
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,314
Everything that's
happened to us.

31
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,482
All the stuff we've done.

32
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,361
Are we gonna tell them
the truth?

33
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,198
We're gonna tell them
who we are.

34
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,076
But how do you say that?
I mean...

35
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,497
who are we?

36
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,166
( walker snarling )

37
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,559
- ( blade slices )
- ( thuds )

38
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,854
There you go.

39
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,566
It's a small one.

40
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,110
It'll do.

41
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:44,408
So, this is just
a simple slipknot.

42
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,118
Tie one on both ends,

43
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,287
then you tighten
one side to a branch.

44
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,456
Now, you see how
the ground here

45
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,583
is sort of like
a funnel shape?

46
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,127
- It's a trail?
- That's right.

47
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,630
That's where you want
to set the noose.

48
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,798
So you hide it
with leaves.

49
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,967
Then you put sticks
all around it

50
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,511
so any animals going by
have to run this way

51
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,805
right into the trap.

52
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,140
Man:
Help!

53
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,226
- Somebody help!
- Carl.

54
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,270
- Carl, stop! Carl!
- Man: Get back! Back!

55
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,982
- ( walkers snarling )
- Help!

56
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,650
Get away!
Get back!

57
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,652
Help!
Somebody help!

58
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,862
Help me!

59
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,031
Get away!

60
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,574
No!

61
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,076
Get away!

62
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,162
- Help! Somebody help!
- We can't help him.

63
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,331
( screaming )

64
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,754
No! No! No!

65
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,799
No!
( screaming )

66
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,175
We've got to go.

67
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,540
Morning.

68
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,584
Everything okay?

69
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,295
Yeah, just want a little
help with something.

70
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,048
What time is it?

71
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,259
I never know what time
it is anymore.

72
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,219
Ever since I gave
Glenn my watch,

73
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,513
it's always
right now to me.

74
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,223
It's early.

75
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,145
He's decent.

76
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,689
- Morning.
- Morning.

77
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,566
Bethy's gonna
take Judith.

78
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,861
Rick:
What are we doing?

79
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,030
You'll see.

80
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,865
You're not going
to need that.

81
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,285
It'll just get
in the way.

82
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,715
Rick:
Let's go.

83
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,183
Michonne: Thought maybe
there'd be some houses down this way.

84
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,352
Maybe even a store.

85
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,815
There's got to be some food
around here somewhere.

86
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,983
Hey, look.

87
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,701
( walker gurgling )

88
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,568
That was one
small rabbit.

89
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,570
It was something.

90
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,698
Got to hand it
to the thing.

91
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,074
It traveled well.

92
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,493
( chuckles )

93
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,205
Have you noticed that's all
we talk about anymore?

94
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,166
Food.

95
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,336
I forgot
what this feels like.

96
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,131
Me, too.

97
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,508
I hope we're able
to forget again soon.

98
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,303
We're close.

99
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,139
Just got to make it
through another day.

100
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,519
If folks there are taking people in,
they have to be strong.

101
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,189
They have to have
a system.

102
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,233
I wonder if
the whole thing's legit.

103
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,694
( branches snap )

104
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,249
We let people in.

105
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,126
We did.

106
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,128
So did the Governor.

107
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,091
Yeah, it's always
the same, isn't it?

108
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,510
Don't get to know
until we know.

109
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,264
Maybe this place
isn't even there anymore.

110
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,850
Oh, dearie me.

111
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,937
You screwed up,
asshole.

112
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,899
You hear me?
You screwed up.

113
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,789
Today is a day
of reckoning, sir.

114
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,457
Restitution.

115
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,378
A balancing of the whole
damn universe.

116
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,593
Shit, and I was thinking
of turning in for the night

117
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,222
on New Year's Eve.
( laughs )

118
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,475
Now who's gonna count
down the ball dropper with me, huh?

119
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,603
10 Mississippi.

120
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,272
Nine Mississippi.

121
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,857
- Eight Mississippi.
- Daryl: Joe!

122
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,622
- Hold up.
- You're stopping me on eight, Daryl.

123
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,794
Just hold up.

124
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,297
This is the guy that killed Lou,
so we got nothing to talk about.

125
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,633
The thing about nowadays
is we got nothing but time.

126
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,094
Say your piece, Daryl.

127
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,973
These people,

128
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,517
you're gonna let 'em go.

129
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,561
These are good people.

130
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,773
Now, I think Lou would
disagree with you on that.

131
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,650
I'll, of course, have to
speak for him and all

132
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,403
'cause your friend here
strangled him in a bathroom.

133
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,826
You want blood,
I get it.

134
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,540
Take it from me, man.

135
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,209
Come on.

136
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,467
This man killed our friend.

137
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,011
You say he's good people.

138
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,766
See, now that
right there is a lie.

139
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,935
It's a lie!

140
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,854
- Come on. ( groans )
- No!

141
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,607
( grunting )

142
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,817
Teach him, fellas.
Teach him all the way.

143
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,655
- No!
- Come here, boy.

144
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,116
You leave him be!

145
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,745
Shh.

146
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,706
You'll get yours.
You just wait your turn.

147
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,834
Listen, it was me.
It was just me.

148
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,546
See, now that's right.
That's not some damn lie.

149
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,965
Look, we can settle this.
We're reasonable men.

150
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,720
First, we're gonna beat
Daryl to death.

151
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,056
Then we'll have the girl.

152
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,183
Then the boy.

153
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,144
Then I'm gonna shoot you
and then we'll be square.

154
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,313
( laughing )

155
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,363
Let him go.

156
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,490
Stop your squirming.

157
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,244
( laughing )

158
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,248
Let him go.

159
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,208
- ( Carl whimpering )
- ( man laughing )

160
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,378
- ( gunshot )
- ( ears ringing )

161
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,053
( coughing )

162
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,726
I got him.

163
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,687
Oh, it's gonna be
so much worse now.

164
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,605
( whimpering )

165
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,984
( laughing )

166
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,277
Shh.

167
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,038
Come on, get up!

168
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,629
Come on.
Let's see what you got.

169
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,507
- ( groaning )
- Shh. ( laughing )

170
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,427
- ( laughing continues )
- ( belt buckle clinks )

171
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,763
- You leave him be!
- Huh? Right over here.

172
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,099
What the hell are you
gonna do now, sport?

173
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,894
( screams )

174
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,521
( gurgling )

175
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,827
( gunshot )

176
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,666
I'll kill him.
I'll-- I'll kill him!

177
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,834
Let the boy go.

178
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,544
( grunts )

179
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,132
( gurgling )

180
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,177
He's mine.

181
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,972
Stay back.
Stay--

182
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,641
Please--

183
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:15,479
( screaming )

184
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,365
( stabbing continues )

185
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,002
( stabbing continues )

186
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,052
Hershel:
Here.

187
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,014
What is?

188
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,434
Those feral pigs
in the forest,

189
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,062
it doesn't take much
to domesticate them.

190
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,565
Same with the horses
we've seen.

191
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,235
We have seeds.
We can grow our own food.

192
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,153
It's time
we started planting.

193
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,614
Okay.

194
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,577
Can't do it myself.

195
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,205
I got to go out there.

196
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,958
Go on runs,
be at the fences.

197
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,628
I teach you
how to do this.

198
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,797
You teach Carl.

199
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,091
We're going to be
here a while.

200
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,969
They need me.

201
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,971
We've been here
two months.

202
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,265
You've made it work.

203
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,891
The war is over, Rick.

204
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,060
No, we don't know that.

205
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,688
I'm talking
about you.

206
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,025
I'm saying it,
and I'm saying this,

207
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,486
you pull Carl back
from going out there, fine.

208
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,448
- He shot that boy.
- Yeah, I know.

209
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,117
He needs his father.

210
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,162
He needs his father
to show him the way.

211
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,332
What way are you
going to show him?

212
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,376
He can shoot,
we know that.

213
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,254
What's his life
going to be?

214
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,798
What's yours?

215
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,594
All this.

216
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,809
I'm just saying
everything

217
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,645
because I owe you.

218
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,981
We all owe you.

219
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,195
We can make this
better now.

220
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,281
Things changing in here

221
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,659
doesn't change
things out there.

222
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,994
No, it doesn't.

223
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,914
But we're here today,
right now.

224
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,957
This is a good place
to start.

225
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,170
( motor starts )

226
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,589
There's a run soon.

227
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,342
- I got to go.
- No, you don't.

228
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,114
We should save it
to drink.

229
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,159
You can't see yourself,
he can.

230
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,881
I didn't know
what they were.

231
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,676
How'd you wind up
with them?

232
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,512
I was with Beth.

233
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,266
We got out together.

234
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,729
I was with her
for a while.

235
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,486
Is she dead?

236
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,948
She's just gone.

237
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,580
After that,

238
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,665
that's when they found me.

239
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,626
I mean, I knew
they were bad,

240
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,796
but they had a code.

241
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,549
It was simple.

242
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:59,137
Stupid, but it
was something.

243
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,639
It was enough.

244
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,891
And you weren't alone.

245
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,062
Said they were looking
for some guy.

246
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,567
Last night they said
they spotted him.

247
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,737
I was hanging back.
I was gonna leave.

248
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,198
But I stayed.

249
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,787
That's when I saw
it was you three.

250
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,582
Right when you saw me.

251
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:35,090
I didn't know
what they could do.

252
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,681
It's not on you, Daryl.

253
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,018
Hey.

254
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,854
It's not on you.

255
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:54,484
You being back
with us here, now,

256
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,570
that's everything.

257
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,413
You're my brother.

258
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,721
Hey, what you did
last night...

259
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,683
anybody would
have done that.

260
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,352
No, not that.

261
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,654
Something happened.

262
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,156
That ain't you.

263
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,576
Daryl, you saw
what I did to Tyreese.

264
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,829
It ain't all of it, but that's me.

265
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,664
That's why I'm here now.

266
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,292
That's why Carl is.

267
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,669
I want to keep him safe.

268
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,174
That's all that matters.

269
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,317
You okay?

270
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,402
Yeah.

271
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,701
I'm okay.

272
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,662
I know.

273
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,333
How?

274
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,671
'Cause I'm okay, too.

275
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,061
We're getting close.

276
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,063
Be there before sundown.

277
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,524
Now we head through
the woods.

278
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,484
We don't know
who they are.

279
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,986
All right.

280
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,436
We all spread out,

281
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,188
watch for a while,
see what we see,

282
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,025
and get ready.

283
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,110
We all stay close.

284
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,363
You want to stick with me?

285
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,949
It's all right.

286
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,377
Why didn't you go
with your dad?

287
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,556
When I told you
about Andre,

288
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,267
you never asked
how he died.

289
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,269
I knew why.

290
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,773
Yeah, but the how
is important.

291
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,109
We went to a refugee camp.

292
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,739
Andre
and my boyfriend Mike,

293
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,908
that was Andre's father,

294
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,160
and our friend Terry.

295
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,037
At the camp,

296
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,123
it just got worse
and worse.

297
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,917
People were leaving.

298
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,585
People giving up.

299
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,755
But I didn't.

300
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,592
I was coming back
from a run.

301
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,098
I saw the fences were down.

302
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,435
I heard the moans.

303
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,772
It was over.

304
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,483
And Mike and Terry,

305
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,735
they were high
when it happened.

306
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,406
They were bit.

307
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,702
Could have stopped it.

308
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,996
Could have killed them.

309
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,167
But I let them turn.

310
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,088
I made it
so they couldn't bite,

311
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,173
couldn't scratch.

312
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,050
I tied chains
around their necks.

313
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,845
It was insane.

314
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,805
It was sick.

315
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,559
It felt like
what I deserved,

316
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,813
dragging them around
so that I would always know.

317
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,774
I found out that
they kept me safe.

318
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,321
They hid me.

319
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,992
The walkers didn't
see me anymore.

320
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,994
I was just
another monster.

321
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,081
And I was.

322
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,167
Me.

323
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,920
I was gone
for a long time.

324
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,010
But then Andrea
brought me back.

325
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,596
Your dad
brought me back.

326
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,850
You did.

327
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,525
I see how you've been
looking at your dad.

328
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,653
You don't have
to be afraid of me

329
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,323
or him.

330
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,705
He told me the other day

331
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,082
that he was proud of me.

332
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,295
That I was a good man.

333
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,713
I'm not.

334
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,966
- Carl.
- I know more now. ( sniffles )

335
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,636
About what
he wanted for me.

336
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,638
And I tried, but...

337
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,642
I still have
these thoughts.

338
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,027
I'm not
what he thinks I am.

339
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,242
I'm just another
monster, too.

340
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,708
Just in case.

341
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,030
Woman:
Terminus--

342
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,782
those who arrive survive.

343
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,284
Follow the tracks
to the point

344
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,745
where all lines
intersect.

345
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,705
There are maps
at the crossings

346
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,458
to help guide you
with your journey.

347
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,336
Sanctuary for all.

348
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,629
Community for all.

349
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,174
Those who arrive survive.

350
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,510
Terminus,
sanctuary for all.

351
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,012
- Community for all.
- Hello.

352
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,513
Those who s--

353
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,973
Hello.

354
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,023
Well, I bet Albert
is on perimeter watch.

355
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,782
You here to rob us?

356
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,034
No.

357
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,039
We wanted to see you
before you saw us.

358
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:34,045
Makes sense.

359
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,963
Usually we do this
where the tracks meet.

360
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,799
Ahem.

361
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,301
Welcome to Terminus.

362
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,472
I'm Gareth.

363
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,100
Looks like you've been
on the road for a good bit.

364
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,519
We have.

365
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:54,399
Rick. That's Carl,
Daryl, Michonne.

366
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,405
You're nervous.
I get it.

367
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,116
We were all the same way.

368
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,910
We came here for sanctuary.

369
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,745
That what you're here for?

370
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,956
Yes.

371
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,666
Good.

372
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,377
You found it.
Hey, Alex.

373
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,963
This isn't as pretty
as the front.

374
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,548
We got nothing to hide,
but the welcome wagon

375
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,259
is a whole lot nicer.

376
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,594
Alex will take you,
ask you a few questions.

377
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,389
Uh, but first,

378
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,891
we need to see
everyone's weapons.

379
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,269
If you could just lay them
down in front of you.

380
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,991
All right.

381
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,785
- I'm sure you understand.
- Yes, I do.

382
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,422
I'd hate to see the other guy.

383
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,340
You would.

384
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,762
- They deserve it?
- Yes.

385
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,976
Just so you know,
we aren't those kind of people,

386
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,936
but we aren't
stupid either.

387
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,899
And you shouldn't be stupid enough
to try anything stupid.

388
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,193
As long as everyone's clear
on that, we shouldn't have any problems.

389
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,070
Just solutions.

390
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,823
Okay.

391
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,677
Follow me.

392
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,354
So how long's
this place been here?

393
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,689
Since almost the start.

394
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,650
When all the camps
got overrun,

395
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,235
people started
finding this place.

396
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,029
I think it was instinct,
you know?

397
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,490
Follow a path.

398
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:08,991
Some folks were
heading to the coast,

399
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,202
others out west
or up north,

400
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,163
but they all
wound up here.

401
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,915
Hi.

402
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,876
Heard you came in
the back door. Smart.

403
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,836
You'll fit
right in here.

404
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,925
Hey, Mary, would you fix each
of these new folks a plate for me?

405
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,387
Michonne:
Why do you do it?

406
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,138
Why do you let
people in?

407
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,433
The more people become a part of us,
we get stronger.

408
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,186
That's why we put up
the signs,

409
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,522
invite people in.

410
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,607
It's how we survive.

411
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,402
Here.

412
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,038
No.

413
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,339
Where the hell
did you get this watch?

414
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,201
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hey, Mr. Grimes.

415
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,037
Thanks for grabbing these.

416
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,831
Well, I thought
Carl might want 'em.

417
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,251
They were just
sitting there.

418
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,630
I figured
it had been a while.

419
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,801
I'm not ashamed that
they're for ages four to 12.

420
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,428
You shouldn't be.

421
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,022
Hey.

422
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,732
Hey.

423
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,500
- Carl.
- Yes?

424
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,004
Carl.

425
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,840
I need your help
with something.

426
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,512
Leave it behind.

427
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,263
What?

428
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:44,146
It'll just
get in the way.

429
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,566
Rick: Where the hell
did you get this watch?

430
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,777
You want answers?
You want anything else?

431
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,779
You get 'em when
you put down the gun.

432
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,281
I see your man
on the roof with a sniper rifle.

433
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,867
How good's his aim?
Where'd you get the watch?

434
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,874
- Where'd you get the watch?!
- Don't do anything!

435
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,002
I have this!
You just put it down.

436
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,838
You put it down!

437
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,549
You want to listen to me.
There's a lot of us.

438
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,385
Where did you
get the watch?

439
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,886
I got it off
of a dead one.

440
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,596
I didn't think
he'd need it.

441
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,059
Rick: What about the riot gear?
The poncho?

442
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,895
Got the riot gear
off a dead cop.

443
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,064
Found the poncho
on a clothesline.

444
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,277
- Gareth, we can wait.
- Shut up, Alex.

445
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:32,945
You talk to me.

446
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,074
What's there
left to say?

447
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,659
You don't trust us
anymore.

448
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,786
- Gareth.
- Shut up.

449
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,247
- Gareth, please.
- It's okay.

450
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,166
It's okay.

451
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,793
Rick, what do you want?

452
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,670
Where are our people?

453
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,547
You didn't answer
the question.

454
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:52,715
( gunfire )

455
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,341
- Man: Go, go!
- Gareth: Hey!

456
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,260
- ( men shouting )
- ( radio chatter )

457
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,179
Carl!

458
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,347
Get down, now!
Go!

459
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,640
Man over radio:
Shots fired in the main.

460
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,808
Heading into the building.

461
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,186
Come on!

462
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,899
( gunfire )

463
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,902
Come on!

464
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,869
Here!

465
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,715
- Man over radio: Stay on your shot.
- ( gunfire )

466
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,973
- Come on, this way.
- Gareth: Get them off B!

467
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,437
( radio chatter continues )

468
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,487
- Voices: Help! Help!
- What the hell?

469
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,823
- ( banging )
- Let us out!

470
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,449
- Help!
- Keep going.

471
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,284
Help!

472
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,084
What the hell
is this place?

473
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:14,255
These people,
I don't think they're trying to kill us.

474
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,841
Rick: No, they were
aiming at our feet.

475
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,387
There.

476
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,934
There.

477
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,602
Go!

478
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,275
( gunfire )

479
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,645
Gareth:
Drop your weapons! Now!

480
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,492
Now!

481
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,209
Ringleader,
go to your left.

482
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,545
The train car, go.

483
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,133
You do what we say,
the boy goes with you.

484
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:45,262
Anything else, he dies
and you end up in there anyway.

485
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,193
Now the archer.

486
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,788
Now the samurai.

487
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,023
Stand at the door,
ringleader,

488
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,818
archer, samurai,
in that order.

489
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,659
My son.

490
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,455
Go, kid.

491
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,507
Ringleader,
open the door and go in.

492
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,426
I'll go in with him.

493
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,344
Don't make us
kill him now.

494
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,269
( thuds )

495
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,109
Rick?

496
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,574
You're here.

497
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,498
You're here.

498
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,472
They're our friends.

499
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,602
They helped save us.

500
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,480
Yeah.

501
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,274
Now they're
friends of ours.

502
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,902
For however long
that'll be.

503
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,114
No.

504
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,334
( laughs )
There you go, Judith.

505
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,336
There you go.

506
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,758
Put it in at more
of an angle.

507
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,431
Whoa.

508
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,393
Gonna have to get you
a farming hat.

509
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,021
There's a new sheriff
in town.

510
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,065
( all laugh )

511
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,109
- How's it look?
- Looks good.

512
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:30,279
( laughing )

513
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,366
It can be like this
all the time.

514
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,579
It's like this now.

515
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,915
That's enough.

516
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,219
They're gonna feel
pretty stupid when they find out.

517
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,474
Find out what?

518
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,286
They're fucking
with the wrong people.

519
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,666
( theme music playing )
