1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,297
( walkers snarling )

2
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,595
( snarling )

3
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,400
( theme music playing )

4
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,450
Carl, slow down.

5
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,665
Carl, stop!

6
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,292
We need to stay
together.

7
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,672
We got to find a place
with food, supplies.

8
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,094
Hey.

9
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,429
We're gonna be...

10
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,123
( crows cawing )

11
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,847
Wait outside, okay?

12
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,099
- Keep watch.
- You keep watch.

13
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,767
You can barely stand.

14
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,894
I'm not gonna let you
go in there alone.

15
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,273
- Excuse me?
- We've done this before.

16
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,275
I'm gonna help
you clear it.

17
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:02,486
You should just
let me do it myself.

18
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,328
Let's go.

19
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,346
Kitchen's clear.

20
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,732
( snarling )

21
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,206
That might be
all that's left.

22
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,838
- I can get it from here.
- No.

23
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,216
No, it's weak.

24
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,135
I'll draw it out.

25
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,852
Stay back.

26
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,195
Damn it.

27
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,949
- Don't.
- ( gunshot )

28
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,701
I said not to.

29
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,161
You couldn't do it
with the ax.

30
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,747
I had it.

31
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,166
Every bullet counts.

32
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,043
We'd have needed
that one later.

33
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,755
See what you can find.
Then let's move on.

34
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,353
Kitchen wasn't empty
after all.

35
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:03,107
My haul.
You?

36
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,071
I win.

37
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,832
Hey.

38
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,003
Hey.

39
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,346
Hey.

40
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,018
That one's as good as any.

41
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,464
Quick and quiet.

42
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,259
We need to clear it
before sundown.

43
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,793
Carl.

44
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,594
- Carl.
- I got it.

45
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,222
All the doors
down here are open.

46
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,057
Just stop!

47
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,399
- ( pounds wall )
- Hey, asshole!

48
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,109
Hey, shitface!

49
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,653
- Hey--
- Watch your mouth!

50
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,114
Are you kidding me?

51
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,116
If there's one of them
down there,

52
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,951
they would have come out.

53
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,476
( coughs )

54
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,550
( chuckles )

55
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,406
Rick:
Find anything?

56
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,369
Check the back door?

57
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,931
( grunts )

58
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,808
I tied the door shut.

59
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,478
We don't need to take
any chances.

60
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,770
You don't think
it'll hold?

61
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,106
- Carl.
- It's a strong knot.

62
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,902
Clove hitch.
Shane taught me.

63
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,945
Remember him?

64
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,616
Yeah, I remember him.

65
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,451
I remember him
every day.

66
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,538
There something else
you want to say to me?

67
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:13,310
( wheezing )

68
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,901
This'll have to do
for the night.

69
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,958
You gonna have some?

70
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,251
You should eat.

71
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,253
We should save it.

72
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:08,991
Hey.

73
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,993
I don't want any.

74
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,953
Eat it.

75
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,330
Now.
( wheezing )

76
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,306
( wheezing continues )

77
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,157
Listen, I'm just
being honest.

78
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:54,244
I thought it was a bit...
pedestrian.

79
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,913
- ( laughs ) Pedestrian?
- As in lame.

80
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,249
- And played.
- Played?

81
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,543
Where have you seen
anything like it before? Tell me that.

82
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,503
I've never seen a gorilla
drive a car before,

83
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,340
but if you put it in a museum,
I'm not gonna call it art.

84
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,216
( jazz music playing )

85
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,762
Mike, would you please
talk some sense into your lover?

86
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,097
Oh, my God.
You did not just call me that.

87
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,933
- Mm-hmm.
- I agree with my lover.

88
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,436
- I mean, the whole thing was--
- Very lame.

89
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,480
- And very played.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

90
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,190
No, no, don't do that.
Don't do that.

91
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,692
Don't start finishing
each other's sentences, man.

92
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,110
It's just gross.

93
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,447
I was going to say that the whole thing
was like a monument

94
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,783
to someone trying too damned
hard to be different.

95
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,077
Hallelujah.

96
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,789
Listen,
I'm glad I saw it

97
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,458
even though
I did not love it.

98
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,216
- ( giggling )
- Hope we're not boring you, peanut.

99
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,301
Come here.

100
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,607
I don't think that we
should stay at the camp.

101
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,901
No. I'm not taking
my son out there.

102
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,070
I don't know if this place
will work out,

103
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,656
but I know it won't
if we go out there.

104
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,492
Does it even
matter anymore?

105
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,993
Are we just
kidding ourselves?

106
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,787
Okay.

107
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,039
All right, I see
what this is.

108
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,918
Really?
What is this, Michonne?

109
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,920
I mean, you've gotten
good with a sword.

110
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,672
You know how valuable
that is now?

111
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,508
- You know what that makes you?
- For what?

112
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,053
What are we going for?
Where's the happy ending here?

113
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,013
This isn't life.

114
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,224
This isn't anything
close, okay?

115
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,893
Not for me,
not for us.

116
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,690
And for our son.

117
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,029
What's the answer here?

118
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,782
Well, what is
the damn question, Mike?

119
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,371
Why?

120
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,540
Okay.

121
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,833
That's good.

122
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,961
Now I have a question.

123
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,505
Who's gonna open
the wine?

124
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,762
No. No.

125
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,472
No, no, no, no.

126
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,307
No. No!

127
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:24,311
No! No! No! No!

128
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,605
No!

129
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,941
( gasps, panting )

130
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,360
( walkers snarling )

131
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,370
( groans )

132
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,924
Dad?

133
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,015
Dad?

134
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,397
Dad, wake up.

135
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,237
Wake up.
Come on.

136
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,053
Mom used to do this
to me when I was sick.

137
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,017
( labored breathing )

138
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,400
No.

139
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,945
You have to wake up
right now.

140
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,614
Wake up!
Wake up!

141
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,242
Wake up! Wake up!

142
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,162
- ( thudding at door )
- ( snarling )

143
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,207
- ( snarling )
- ( thudding )

144
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,477
Hey, you!

145
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,273
Fresh meat right here.
Come and get it.

146
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,530
Let's take a walk.

147
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,824
Keep up.

148
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,536
That's it.

149
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,044
Keep coming.

150
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,421
Very good.

151
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,176
Come on, keep coming.

152
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,346
Come on.

153
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,139
Right here,
look at me.

154
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,850
- ( snarling )
- There you go.

155
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,315
Come on.
That's it.

156
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,402
Just a little farther.

157
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,908
That's it.

158
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,496
That's right.

159
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,290
Keep coming.

160
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,543
Just a little farther.

161
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,174
Come on.

162
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,597
- ( snarling )
- Oh, shit.

163
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,526
( grunts )

164
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,619
( gunshot )

165
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,666
( gunshot )

166
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,129
( grunting )

167
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,341
( gunshots )

168
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,388
( exhales )

169
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,391
( panting )

170
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,936
( groaning )

171
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,253
( coughing )

172
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,815
I win.

173
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,503
Cool.

174
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,868
( sniffles )

175
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,953
I killed three walkers.

176
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,707
They were at the door.

177
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,502
They were gonna get in,

178
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,880
but I lured them away.

179
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,967
I killed them.

180
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,347
I saved you.

181
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,808
I saved you.

182
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,603
I didn't forget while
you had us playing farmer.

183
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,189
I still know
how to survive.

184
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,360
Lucky for us.

185
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,741
I don't need you anymore.

186
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,454
I don't need you
to protect me anymore.

187
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,289
I can take care
of myself.

188
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,749
You probably can't even
protect me anyways.

189
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,835
You couldn't protect Judith.

190
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,545
You couldn't protect...

191
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,505
( sighs )

192
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,133
Hershel or Glenn

193
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,551
or Maggie.

194
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,387
Michonne, Daryl,

195
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:27,348
or Mom.

196
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,853
You just wanted
to plant vegetables.

197
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,563
You just wanted
to hide.

198
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,566
He knew where we were
and you didn't care!

199
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,526
You just hid
behind those fences

200
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,403
and waited for...

201
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,904
( sighs )

202
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,739
They're all gone now.

203
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,284
Because of you!

204
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,077
They counted on you!

205
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,163
You were their leader!

206
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,337
( sniffles )

207
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,548
But now...

208
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,760
you're nothing.

209
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,394
( sniffles )

210
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,649
( sighs )

211
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,783
I'd be fine
if you died.

212
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,665
( grunts )

213
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,515
( grunts )

214
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,103
Damn it.

215
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,478
( door creaks )

216
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,980
( snarling )

217
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,786
( gunshots )

218
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,877
( gunshot )

219
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,340
( clicking )

220
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,305
Oh, shit.

221
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,895
Come on.

222
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,448
Come on.

223
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,207
Come on.

224
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,709
( grunts )

225
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,014
Come on.

226
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,476
( whimpering )

227
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,907
- ( pounding )
- ( panting )

228
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:18,300
( walker snarling )

229
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,552
No!

230
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,223
No. No.

231
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,165
No! No! No! No!

232
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,377
( panting )

233
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,934
( sobbing )

234
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,280
( raspy breathing )

235
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,032
( gasps )

236
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,042
( breathing heavily )

237
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,128
( hammer clicks )

238
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,590
( raspy breathing )

239
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,051
( bowl clatters )

240
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,972
( crying )

241
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:44,024
( crying continues )

242
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,073
I can't.

243
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,829
I was wrong.

244
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,500
Just do it.

245
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,504
Carl.
( wheezing )

246
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,262
Don't go outside.

247
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,223
Stay safe.

248
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,578
I'm scared.

249
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,043
( crying )

250
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,505
I'm scared.

251
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,511
I'm scared.

252
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,740
Mike.

253
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,078
I miss you.

254
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,169
I missed you even
when I was with you.

255
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,050
Back at the camp.

256
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,553
It wasn't you
who did it.

257
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,477
( sighs )

258
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,524
You were wrong.

259
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,693
Because I'm still here.

260
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,572
And you could be, too.

261
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,741
And he could be.

262
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,746
( sighs )

263
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,919
I know the answer.

264
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,885
I know why.

265
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,723
( sighs )

266
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,600
( snarling )

267
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,951
Rick:
You shouldn't have risked it,

268
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,078
going out there like that.

269
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,581
It's dangerous.

270
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,001
I was careful.

271
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,798
It's good that
you found more food.

272
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,845
I found even more.

273
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,973
But I ate it.

274
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,186
What was it?

275
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,816
112 ounces of pudding.

276
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,818
( chuckles )

277
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,950
I know...

278
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,704
we'll never get things back
to the way they used to be.

279
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,999
What?

280
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,087
I only clung
to that for you.

281
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,757
For Judith.

282
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,721
Now she's gone.

283
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,520
And you...

284
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,484
you're a man, Carl.

285
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,112
You're a man.

286
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,491
I'm sorry.

287
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,247
You don't need to be.

288
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:43,091
( sobs )

289
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,901
( knocking )

290
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,577
( cocks gun )

291
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,419
( chuckles )

292
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,464
What?

293
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,675
It's for you.

294
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,850
( theme music playing )
