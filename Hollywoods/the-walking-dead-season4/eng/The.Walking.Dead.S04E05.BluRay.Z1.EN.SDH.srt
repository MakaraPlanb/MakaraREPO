1
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,282
( coughing )

2
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,877
Henry, I need you to calm down.

3
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,087
We're trying to help.

4
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,265
No--!

5
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,317
( air bag hissing )

6
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,410
( coughing )

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,624
Drink some of that.
Both of you.

8
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,250
( coughing )

9
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,509
Some council meeting, huh?

10
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,803
We're two members short.

11
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,515
Hershel: I think we should make some
new rules before they get back.

12
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,143
I hereby declare we have
spaghetti Tuesdays

13
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,270
every Wednesday.

14
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,151
First we have to find
some spaghetti.

15
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,037
You okay to take over?

16
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,045
Every five to six seconds, squeeze.

17
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,464
You start feeling lightheaded,

18
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,676
grab somebody else to take over.

19
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,012
We'll take it in shifts.

20
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,516
You want to help me
go on my rounds?

21
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,935
Yeah.

22
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,895
Sure.

23
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,904
How long will that keep him alive?

24
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,869
Just as long
as we're willing to do it.

25
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,414
As long as it takes.

26
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,043
( coughing )

27
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,089
( hisses )

28
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,343
( scattered coughing )

29
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,159
( whispers )
No. Not here.

30
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,048
Help me get him on this.

31
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,593
Okay, but in a couple
of hours when Henry's dead--

32
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,845
- Glenn.
- How are we gonna get his body

33
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,598
down the stairs,
across the cell block

34
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,433
and through those doors
without anyone noticing?

35
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,354
If that happens-- if--
you're gonna help me.

36
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,440
And what if I'm gone?

37
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,443
Shut up and help me
get him on this.

38
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,245
What are you doing?

39
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,377
We're taking Mr. Jacobson
to a quieter place.

40
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,842
Go get my copy of "Tom Sawyer"
from my room.

41
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,387
I want you to read it by tonight.

42
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,889
- We all got jobs to do.
- ( coughs )

43
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,558
- That one's yours.
- I won't finish it.

44
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,980
Why?

45
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,648
It's gonna get too dark.

46
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,817
Well,

47
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,111
give it your best try.

48
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,738
- ( coughing )
- And drink some tea.

49
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,798
You haven't had to do this yet,
have you?

50
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,095
There was one late last night.

51
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,180
Sasha did it.

52
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,475
People don't need to see it.

53
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,644
I don't want them to.

54
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,356
( grunting )

55
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,286
( theme music playing )

56
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,237
( door opens )

57
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,210
Where's Glenn?
He said he would meet me.

58
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,379
He's resting.

59
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,881
Is he okay?

60
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,384
He was helping me
and he got tired, that's all.

61
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,929
- If you need help, I can help you.
- I don't.

62
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,640
I was just keeping him occupied.

63
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,892
Keeping his mind
on helping people.

64
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,811
I can come in there
and help you.

65
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,270
No, you don't need to.

66
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,439
- You can rest--
- No!

67
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,956
How's Bethy?

68
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,292
She's okay.

69
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,503
Daddy, you look so tired.

70
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,464
I am.
( chuckles )

71
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,133
But I'm fine.

72
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,969
They could return any minute now.

73
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,722
It's hard in here.

74
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,267
But we're holding it together.

75
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,478
We're gonna make it.

76
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,777
Don't you believe that?

77
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,490
Of course.

78
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,952
Just hold it together a little longer.

79
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,872
Please?

80
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,501
I love you, honey.

81
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,256
I love you, too.

82
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,027
Thank you for stopping her.

83
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,447
We need someone out there
taking care of things.

84
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,492
If she saw me,

85
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,162
couldn't keep her out.

86
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,706
I know you didn't want to lie to her.

87
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,082
I wasn't lying.

88
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,709
Look at you.
You're resting.

89
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,169
( chuckles )

90
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,421
I'm almost done down here.

91
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,257
Why don't you go lie down?

92
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,767
( growling )

93
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,326
( gate creaks )

94
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,968
Carl, Judith, are they okay?

95
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,427
Yeah. Where's Carol?

96
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,264
Glenn, Hershel, Sasha?

97
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,766
Yeah, it's bad, but they're fighting it.
Daryl's not back yet.

98
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,727
Rick.
Rick, where's Carol?

99
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,319
It was her.

100
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,114
She killed Karen and David.

101
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,954
She was trying to stop it
from spreading.

102
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,665
Tyreese is gonna
be back here soon,

103
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,458
so I didn't think she should be here.

104
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,088
And I couldn't have her here.

105
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,091
She has a car, supplies,

106
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,968
she'll figure it out.

107
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,096
I'll tell your dad.
Don't tell anyone else yet.

108
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,390
Okay.

109
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,731
Would you have brought her back?

110
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,736
- She said she did it?
- Yeah.

111
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,951
Then you were right
to send her away.

112
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,328
I don't know if I could have.

113
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,913
You could have, Maggie.

114
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,166
You've done harder things.

115
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,836
Don't doubt yourself.
We don't get to anymore.

116
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,007
Rick, the cluster's getting bigger
than the one that took the fence down.

117
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,177
- We need to do something.
- We will.

118
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,847
Carl?

119
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,017
Carl.

120
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,604
Carl?

121
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,481
You okay?

122
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,858
I was gonna ask you that.

123
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,110
- We're fine.
- No one's sick?

124
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,653
You didn't have to do anything?

125
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,615
Haven't had to use my gun, Dad.

126
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,867
And Judith?

127
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,494
She's with Beth.

128
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,204
Good.

129
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,040
Found some food on the run.

130
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,376
There's a bunch
of fruit leather in there.

131
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,544
Have everybody brush
their teeth after.

132
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,383
- Can we come out soon?
- Not just yet.

133
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,053
Dad, I was around you
when you were in the middle of it.

134
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,473
And I was around Patrick.

135
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,184
I didn't get it.
I can help you.

136
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,729
Thanks, but I need you to stay here.

137
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,898
I will.

138
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:17,736
But, Dad, you can't keep me from it.

139
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,907
From what?

140
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,909
From what always happens.

141
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,373
Yeah. Maybe.

142
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,834
But I think it's my job to try.

143
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,587
( door closes )

144
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,226
Thank you.

145
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,105
No problem.

146
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,450
( raspy breathing )

147
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,620
Let's have a look at you.

148
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,047
Doctors make the worst patients.

149
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,302
Not everyone gets to live.

150
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,223
( sniffles )
End stage

151
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,601
is a point that no one
comes back from

152
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,645
or they--
or they can't.

153
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,316
That's where I am.

154
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,653
No, you need to focus on
the ones that can make it.

155
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,574
I made some more IVs.

156
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,828
If you're not ready to lose one,

157
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,288
you're gonna lose them all.

158
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,290
It's like turning off a light--

159
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,918
it'll happen one after the other.

160
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,629
And they don't just die.

161
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,006
We can hold on.

162
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,343
Caleb.

163
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,345
Caleb.

164
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,097
After what happened
in the other cell block,

165
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,017
when I came in here,
I brought these.

166
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,187
Get back in bed now.
We're not that bad off.

167
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,275
When we are,

168
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,694
it'll be too late.

169
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,113
You don't understand.

170
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,783
You have a chance.

171
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,493
This is it after this.

172
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,703
I'm not giving up on anyone.

173
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,956
Not yet.

174
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,543
Just make sure everyone's
doors are shut.

175
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,965
Caleb...

176
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,718
Just make sure!

177
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,221
( coughing )

178
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,810
Caleb, you've got
to let me look at you.

179
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,607
Okay, Hershel.

180
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,193
Have a look.

181
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,327
Drink the tea I left you.

182
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,330
Gonna be back to check
on you in an hour.

183
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,958
( coughing, gagging )

184
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,055
( gurgling )

185
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,640
( gurgling stops )

186
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,074
( distant coughing )

187
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,126
Everyone,

188
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,545
get back in your cells.

189
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,511
Go on, get back in your cells.

190
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,894
Let's get him on this.

191
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,748
( grunting )

192
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,542
( panting )

193
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,880
Go rest.

194
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,049
Can you make it to your cell?

195
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:05,357
♪ Go your way ♪

196
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,654

203

( crunches )

204
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,398
Rick:
Hershel.

205
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,449
Third one we've lost.

206
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,993
We're burning them
behind the blocks.

207
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,620
Burning them.

208
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,374
That's what it's come to.

209
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,795
Are you okay?

210
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,258
I talked to him yesterday
about Steinbeck.

211
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,761
He told me a quote.

212
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,513
"A sad soul

213
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:22,058
can kill quicker
than a germ."

214
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,773
That's exactly why I didn't want
them all to see what happens.

215
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,068
I know they know,

216
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,572
but I didn't want them
to see it right now.

217
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,326
They're seeing you, Hershel.

218
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,373
They see you keep going.

219
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,710
Even after all the choices
keep getting taken away.

220
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,304
When we get past this thing...

221
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,308
it's not gonna be like
how it was, is it?

222
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,977
No.

223
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,984
Was that denial?

224
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,070
Not seeing things for how they were?

225
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,822
No.

226
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,074
You just caught a break.

227
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,744
You needed some time.
You got some.

228
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,830
You got lucky.

229
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,249
We all did.

230
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,794
I still think there's a plan.

231
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,214
I still believe there's a reason.

232
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,302
You think it's all a test?

233
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,306
Life was always a test, Rick.

234
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,481
I need to talk to you about Carol.

235
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,750
( rattles )

236
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,549
( rattles )

237
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,150
Come on.

238
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,485
Come on, Sasha.

239
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,406
You know how to fight.

240
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,910
Just hold on.

241
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,500
Just hold on.
Don't give up on me, now.

242
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,134
( growling )

243
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,812
I just talked to your dad.

244
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,358
He looks good,
all things considered.

245
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,362
If Carl were sick,
would you be up there with him?

246
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,282
If I thought I could help.

247
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,242
You don't think I can help?

248
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:31,748
( yelps )

249
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,209
- ( grunts )
- Damn.

250
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,257
I'm just glad you're out here with me.

251
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,982
Welcome back.

252
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,403
I passed out?

253
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,448
You were dehydrated.
Being a hero takes a lot out of you.

254
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,660
You should know.

255
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,666
I thought you were an idiot
to come in here.

256
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:19,671
I mean, I was sure you were just gonna
be a dead foolish man.

257
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,424
I can't tell
if that's a compliment.

258
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,010
I don't know what I'm saying.

259
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,304
I must have hit my head.

260
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,521
I don't believe in magic

261
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,857
or luck.

262
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,194
I do the math

263
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,864
and I don't gamble.

264
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,869
But I don't know
if I'd be here right now

265
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,705
if you weren't
so damn stupid.

266
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,041
You know what?

267
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,127
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

268
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,302
( hissing )

269
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,701
( air hissing )

270
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,589
Hersh--
( coughs )

271
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,009
Hershel--
( coughing )

272
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,597
( retching )

273
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,605
( rattling )

274
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,316
I'll check on you in a little while.

275
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,947
How is he?

276
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,698
He's sleeping.

277
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,368
You should get
some rest yourself.

278
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:17,288
I don't want to leave him
in case he wakes up.

279
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,291
( rattling )

280
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,710
- Want me to take a look at him?
- No.

281
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,630
Just let him sleep.

282
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,466
( wheezing )

283
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,013
- ( growling )
- Hershel!

284
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,807
Hershel!

285
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,601
( growling )

286
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,692
Everyone stay in your cells.

287
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,781
No.

288
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,491
( crunches )

289
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,163
( woman screams )

290
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,665
- ( screams )
- ( gunshot echoes )

291
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,713
Go.

292
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,048
The fence is more important.
We need to keep it standing.

293
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,342
I got this.

294
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,514
- You can't do this alone.
- I know. Go.

295
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,735
- ( gunshot )
- ( screaming )

296
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,701
Lizzie:
Just follow me, Henry.

297
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,829
Down here, away from Glenn.
Come on.

298
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,458
Come on, Henry.
Here we go. This way.

299
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,460
( growling )

300
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,007
( snarling )

301
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,433
Come on, boy.
Come on, Henry.

302
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,144
Just a little more.

303
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,854
Keep coming.

304
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,065
Come on, boy.
Let's go. Come on.

305
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,949
Carl?

306
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,829
( softly )
Carl...?

307
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,832
Carl.

308
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,626
I heard gunshots.

309
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,586
I need your help.

310
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,092
Lizzie:
Come on. Down here, Henry.

311
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,261
Keep following me.
Come here.

312
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,264
A little further.

313
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,474
Henry, come on--
( gasps )

314
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,394
( screaming )

315
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,572
- You okay?
- I called him nice.

316
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,409
He didn't scratch Glenn.
I thought maybe he listens.

317
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,995
- Lizzie, where is Glenn?
- His cell.

318
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,290
( panting )

319
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,042
Dad!

320
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,628
Dad! Open the door!

321
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,008
( thumps )

322
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,137
( clanks )

323
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,390
( screams )

324
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,726
Get back in there.

325
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,521
You two stay put in here.

326
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:30,523
( rattles )

327
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,817
( gasping, wheezing )

328
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,034
Hold on, Glenn.
Hold on.

329
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,162
( snaps )

330
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,665
( woman whimpers )
Hershel!

331
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,884
( snarling )

332
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,969
Caleb.
Caleb, we need the gun.

333
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,513
( growling )

334
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,726
( cracks )

335
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,941
( rattles )

336
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,694
Think they're okay?

337
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,863
If things were going bad,
we would have heard more shots.

338
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,656
Maggie would have gotten us.

339
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,575
We have to do this.

340
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,577
Let's do it.

341
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,540
- I got it.
- Let me help.

342
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,798
All right, set it down.
All right.

343
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,343
( fence rattling )

344
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,179
( creaking )

345
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,561
Run!

346
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,572
Dad, come on!
Come on!

347
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,211
( growling, snarling )

348
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,640
( walkers growling,
snarling )

349
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,725
Dad, what do we do?

350
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,270
Maybe I could back the bus up
against the fence.

351
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,021
Will it hold?

352
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,776
( fence rattling )

353
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,488
Come on.

354
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,870
( growling )

355
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,842
Pockets.

356
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,678
Here.

357
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,138
- Got it?
- Yep.

358
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,599
( fence creaking )

359
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,775
- All right, listen to me.
- Carl: All right.

360
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,737
Magazine goes in here.
Release is here.

361
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,530
Make sure it latches.

362
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,950
Pull back the operating rod

363
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,785
- and rounds feed up.
- ( clicks )

364
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,705
Keep squeezing the trigger
for rapid fire, okay?

365
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,874
You shoot or you run.

366
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,168
Don't let 'em get close, okay?

367
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,712
( rattling )

368
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,351

- We have something.
- ( Glenn wheezing )

387
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,832
We still have it.

388
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,382
Son of a bitch.

No! You could hit the bag.
We need it for Glenn.

00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,662
( gunshot )

395
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,126

( Glenn gasping )

397
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,593
He's turning blue!

398
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,388
Clear his airway.
I'm on the way.

399
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,477
- Dad.
- Roll him on his back.

Come on, son.

404
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,288
Come on.
You know how this works.

405
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,456
Easy.

406
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,377
Just relax.

407
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,090
Stay with us.

408
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,970
Stay with us...

You're gonna be okay.

412

We're gonna be okay.

413
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,703
I didn't want you in here.

414
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,790
I know.

415
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,418
I had to.

416
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,504
Just like you.

417
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,971
Daddy.

418
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,692
I told you to stay put.

419
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,989
Is it over?

420
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,577
I hope so, honey.

421

Dad...

429
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,514

- I don't know. I'm sorry.

433
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,126

Get in there. We got this.

No. Do your thing.

455

Hey.

456
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,077
You didn't wake me up.

457
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,537
I thought I'd let you sleep in.

458
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,373
- I should help.
- Good.

459
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,084
I've got to go talk to Daryl.

460
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,753
Right now?

No.

00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,924
Soon. Soon.

463
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,270
- How's Glenn doing?
- He made it through the night.

464
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,814
He's breathing on his own now.

465
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,233
Maggie and Bob are with him.

466
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,194
He seems stable enough
for me to get some air.

467
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,239
- He's a tough son of a bitch.
- He is.

468
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,991
You're a tough
son of a bitch.

469

- I am.
- How about Carol?

470

She up in A block with Lizzie?

471
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,125
No. Talk to Rick about her.

472
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,461
She's okay, just talk to him.

473
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,305
You heading out?

474
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,765
You want to come?

475
