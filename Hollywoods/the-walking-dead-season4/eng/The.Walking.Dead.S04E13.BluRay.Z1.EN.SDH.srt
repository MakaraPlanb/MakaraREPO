Just you out here?

00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,114
Yeah.

How long's it been
like that for?

00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,495
I don't know.

35
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:30,042
I was with one group
and another one after that.

36
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,254
They didn't make it?
Neither one of them?

37
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,719
What's your name?

38
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,889
Bob Stookey.

00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,976
You people have a camp?

40
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,231
How many walkers
have you killed?

41
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,903
Haven't kept count.
A couple dozen.

42
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,196
How many people
you kill?

43
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,575
Only one.

44
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,412
Why?

45
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,790
She asked me to.

46
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,212
Want to come with us?

47
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,011
Yes.

48
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,347
You got any
questions for us?

49
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,432
No.

It doesn't matter
who you are.

51
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,728
Really?

52
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,649
Yeah.

53
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,943
It doesn't matter.

It's okay.

right on the bandage.

- Almost done.

How do you know?

76
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,312
The signs are all there.

77
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,356
Just got to know
how to read 'em.

78
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,360
What are we tracking?

79
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,946
You tell me.

80
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,115
You're the one
who wanted to learn.

81
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,870
Well, something
came through here.

82
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,164
The pattern
is all zig-zaggy.

83
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,209
It's a walker.

84
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,378
Maybe it's a drunk.

85
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,840
I'm getting good at this.

86
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,092
Pretty soon I won't
need you at all.

87
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,262

00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,184

Can you move it?

93
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,226
Yeah.

94
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,771
You ready?

95
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,858
We should wait
till the fog clears.

96
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,193
We've been waiting
a while.

97
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,362
You see all this?
We got lucky.

98
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,448
We need visibility.

99
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,116
We've got
six bullets left.

100
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,701
She's right.

101
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,286
We've been doing good
following the plan.

102
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,913
No need
to get sloppy now.

103
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,004
What is it?

104
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,133
It's broken.

105
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,720
We don't need it.

106
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,056
Sun comes up in the east,
sets in the west.

107
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,892
We'll keep an eye
on it in between.

108
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,311
We'll be fine.

109
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,824
Can we--
can we hold up a sec?

110
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,368
You all right?

111
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,870
I just need
to sit down.

112
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,417
All right.
Hold up.

113
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,003
( exhales )

114
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,340
Hop on.

115
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,384
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

116
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,928
This is a serious piggyback.
Jump up.

117
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,475
You're heavier
than you look.

118
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,562
Maybe there are
people there.

119
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,108
Yeah, if there are,
I'll handle them.

120
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,611
There are still
good people, Daryl.

121
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,447
I don't think
the good ones survive.

122
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,673
What's that?

123
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,351
Terminus.

124
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,811
When we were out on the run
to the veterinary college,

125
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,772
we heard a message
about this on the radio.

126
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,441
- They were broadcasting?
- What did it say?

127
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,026
Couldn't make it out.

128
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,111
I only know because
I'm seeing it now.

129
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,447
"Those who arrive survive."

130
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,618
We should go.

131
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,370
I thought we were
looking for Glenn.

132
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,871
If he saw one of these,

133
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,873
he would go looking for me
looking for him.

134
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,708
Look at this map.
All these tracks

135
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,460
from different directions
leading to the same place.

136
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,295
It's far.

137
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,047
And we don't know
if there are other signs.

138
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,715
You don't think
this is the only one.

139
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,510
This is the best lead
we've had so far.

140
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,304
It says sanctuary.
That's just another reason to try.

141
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,640
Others from the prison
could be there. Tyreese.

142
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,809
If it sounds too good
to be true...

143
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,145
Maybe if Glenn saw one of these,
maybe he felt the same way.

144
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,399
He wouldn't.
He'd believe, I know.

145
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,734
What do you want
to do, Sasha?

146
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,362
Keep making these
circles from the bus?

147
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,864
Or are you talking about us
starting to do something else?

148
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,993
We're not splitting up.

149
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,246
That can't happen.

150
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,666
You want to take
a vote or something?

151
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,881
We don't need to vote.

152
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,907
( bangs )

153
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,701
( whistles )

154
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,870
Give it a minute.

155
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,965
It's so clean.

156
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,633
Yeah.

157
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,303
Someone's been
tending to it.

158
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,638
May still be around.

159
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,261
( clears throat )

160
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,014
Let's get
that ankle wrapped.

161
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,523
Looks like somebody
ran out of dolls to dress up.

162
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,274
It's beautiful.

163
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,403
Whoever did this cared.

164
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,200
They wanted these people
to get a funeral.

165
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,036
They remembered
these things were people

166
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,664
before all this.

167
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,333
They didn't let it
change them in the end.

168
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,044
Don't you think
that's beautiful?

169
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,677
Come on.

170
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,972
( clears throat )

171
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,858
- Where's Maggie?
- Getting more firewood.

172
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,988
Still bleeding?

173
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,241
Barely.

174
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,580
- So tell me...
- Tell you what?

175
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,666
You think we should stop.

176
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,504
Yeah.

177
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,757
Tell me why.

178
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,718
To not die.

179
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,763
You, Maggie, me.

180
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,683
- Yeah, that's not it.
- What?

181
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,561
I don't think you know
why you want to stop.

182
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,022
Bob, what happened
this morning,

183
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,773
we get warnings.

184
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,775
We did fine.

185
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,777
We get warnings.

186
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,781
And the next time
it's on us.

187
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,787
Odds are Glenn is dead.

188
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,125
Odds are we will be, too.

189
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,961
That's the reality.

190
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,048
We got six bullets
and you're still bleeding.

191
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,598
Those tracks,
they run through towns.

192
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,851
The first one we see,
we find a building,

193
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,561
some higher ground
to set up in.

194
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,730
All of us.

195
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,649
That's what
we need to do.

196
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,319
That's what
we're gonna do.

197
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,571
If we can talk her
into it.

198
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,832
Just think about it.

199
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,256
Dang.

200
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,676
You find anything?

201
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,514
Whoa.

202
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,140
Peanut butter and jelly,

203
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,851
diet soda,
and pig's feet.

204
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,562
That's a white trash
brunch right there.

205
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,190
It all looks
good to me.

206
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,442
No, hold up.

207
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,861
Ain't a speck of dust
on this.

208
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,531
So?

209
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,200
That means somebody
just put it here.

210
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,119
This is someone's stash.

211
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,705
Maybe they're still alive.

212
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,291
All right, we'll take some of it
and we'll leave the rest, all right?

213
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,293
I knew it.

214
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,878
Knew what?

215
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,505
It's like I said.

216
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,799
There are still
good people.

217
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,970
- Mm.
- Gross.

218
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,058
Hey, those pig's feet
are mine.

219
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,979

( clears throat )

226
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,592
The place
is nailed up tight.

227
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,016
The only way in
is through the front door.

228
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,606
What are you doing?

229
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,942
This is the comfiest bed
I've had in years.

230
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,196
- Really?
- I ain't kidding.

231
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,906
( sighs )

232
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,328
Why don't you go ahead
and play some more?

233
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,622
Keep singing.

234
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,166
I thought my singing
annoyed you.

235
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,877

Bob.

244
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,862
Come on.
She's got to follow the tracks.

245
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,947
We can still
catch up to her.

246
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,539
Sasha, we can still
catch up to her.

247
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,820
( knife clicks )

248
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,490
( snarling )

249
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,442
( scoffs )

250
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,528
You have been grinning
since we left the prison in one piece.

251
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,114
If you're so happy
to be alive,

252
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,909
then why are we walking
into the heart of darkness?

253
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,286
It's not about
me being alive.

254
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,581
( scoffs )

255
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,917
Do you even know
why you're smiling?

256
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,877
Oh, yeah.

257
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,093
I'm not alone.

258
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,680
That's how it happened
when I lost my first group.

259
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,974
And my second group.

260
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,101
I broke that streak.

261
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,520
You'd be smiling, too.

262
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,647
Self-awareness
is a beautiful thing.

263
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,524
You should
try it sometime.

264
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,029
- You're not going to take the bait?
- Nope.

265
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,615
You're just as bullheaded
as she is sometimes.

266
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,409
You know that?

267
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,304
Yeah.

268
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,723
Beth:
Going as fast as I can.

269
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,349
Daryl:
Forget that.

270
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,643
( Beth laughs )

271
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,231
Here you go.

272
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,193
Whew.

273
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,155
All right.
Let's eat.

274
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,576
( cans rattle )

275
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,496
Stay.

276
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,049
( panting )

277
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,217
It's just a damn dog.

278
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,136
Hi.

279
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,056
- Come here, boy.
- ( yelps )

280
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,231
He wouldn't come in?

281
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,067
I told you to stay back.

282
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,653
Yeah, but, Daryl,
you said there was a dog.

283
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,074
Maybe he'll come
back around. Come on.

284
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,243
( walker snarling )

285
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,883
I'm awake.

286
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,302
So am I.

287
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,765
Can you see it?

288
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,934
No.

289
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,435
Been that way
for an hour.

290
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,479
Might be stuck
on something.

291
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,773
( snarling continues )

292
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,567
There's a lot
of noise at night.

293
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,570
Cicadas, owls.

294
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,532
I think sometimes
they go in circles.

295
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,827
Still, when I was
out here by myself,

296
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,703
I didn't sleep much.

297
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,123
You're not sleeping
much now.

298
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,750
You've got to heal.
You need to sleep.

299
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,255
I can try.

300
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,757
( snarling continues )

301
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,272
I tried.

302
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,989
Bob, what the hell
are we doing out here?

303
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,787
Why do you think
Tyreese is dead?

304
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,501
What?

305
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,171
If Tyreese were alive,
he'd go for Terminus.

306
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,339
I know you know that.

307
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,259
So why do you think
he's dead?

308
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,762
Or are you just too afraid
to find out if he is or not?

309
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,728
Hmm.

310
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:25,190
Up until now, I thought you were
the toughest person I ever met.

311
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,901
Which is kind of weird,

312
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,112
'cause you were
the sweetest, too.

313
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,281
Just saying.

314
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,622
( sighs )

315
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,791
( snarling continues )

316
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,593
I'm gonna leave
a thank-you note.

317
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,556
Why?

318
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,017
For when they come back.

319
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,312
If they come back.

320
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,273
Even if they're not coming back,
I still want to say thanks.

321
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,947
Maybe you don't
have to leave that.

322
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,576
Maybe we stick around
here for a while.

323
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,789
They come back,

324
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,416
we'll just make it work.

325
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,543
They may be nuts,

326
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,089
but maybe
it'll be all right.

327
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,095
So you do think there are still
good people around.

328
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,474
( chuckles )
What changed your mind?

329
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,107
You know.

330
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,359
What?

331
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,451
( mumbles )
I don't know.

332
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,162
Don't... ( mumbles )

333
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,373
What changed your mind?

334
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,924
Oh.

335
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,679
- ( cans rattle )
- ( dog barks, whines )

336
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:24,475
I'm gonna give that mutt
one more chance.

337
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,521
( snarling )

338
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,982
Beth! Beth!

339
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,404
Run!

340
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,406
Run!

341
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,662
Beth, pry open a window.
Get your shit.

342
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,041
Beth:
I'm not gonna leave you.

343
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,585
Go out. Go up the road.
I'll meet you there.

344
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,921
Go!

345
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,009
This way.

346
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,748
( tires squealing )

347
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,586
Beth! Beth!

348
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,507
Beth!

349
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,943
She's keeping to the tracks.

350
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,320
If we pick up the pace,
we'll catch her.

351
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,281
( sighs )

352
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,299
( breathing heavily )

353
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,234
( panting )

354
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,193
Bob, right there.

355
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,739
Secure and high up.

356
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,951
See if we can set up something
to catch the rain.

357
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,246
See if we could move
from the rooftops to look for food.

358
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,997
Maybe even try to grow
some up there.

359
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,750
Sasha,
I'm not stopping.

360
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,669
We are.

361
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,588
I'm not.

362
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,882
She's out there alone.

363
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,429
She didn't want us
to come.

364
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,640
She made her choice
for her.

365
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,141
I don't care.

366
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,810
She's alone.

367
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,939
When I got to the prison,
I thought to myself,

368
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,733
"How long?
The clock's ticking.

369
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,028
How long until everyone else
is dead and I'm on my own?"

370
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,115
Bad things happened
'cause I was scared.

371
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:52,702
They didn't need to.
I didn't need to be afraid.

372
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,496
Now, we get to Terminus
and Tyreese isn't there,

373
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,498
it doesn't mean
he's dead.

374
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,918
- You don't need to be afraid.
- I am not afraid.

375
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,057
So this is it?

376
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,394
It doesn't have to be.

377
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,771
That's right.

378
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,781
I'm gonna try
something here.

379
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,308
Well, okay.

380
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,561
You don't have to do it.

381
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,483
You don't have
to be alone again.

382
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,533
I won't be.

383
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,582
( stairs creaking )

384
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,253
( breath hitching )

385
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,141
Maggie?

386
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,187
( snarling )

387
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,523
Oh, shit.

388
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,525
( breathing heavily )

389
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,989
Where's Bob?

390
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,199
Out looking for you.

391
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,286
Why are you here?

392
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,205
I was looking
for another walker.

393
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,541
Found more than I wanted.

394
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,837
You know,
I was lying there

395
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,755
and I remembered--

396
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,550
I heard what you said
back at the camp.

397
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,888
I heard you say
you thought we should

398
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,348
be in a town.

399
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:12,021
What else did you
hear me say?

400
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,149
That odds are
Glenn is dead.

401
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,070
And we should stop.

402
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,120
But you're wrong.

403
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:35,085
So why are you here?

404
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,176
'Cause I was waiting
for you.

405
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,097
I'm not giving up.

406
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,101
But I need your help.

407
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,229
'Cause I can't
do it by myself.

408
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,817
And even if
I catch up to Bob,

409
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,028
we can't do it alone.

410
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,451
I thought that I couldn't
ask you to risk your life.

411
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,997
But I can.

412
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,625
'Cause I know what
you'd be risking it for.

413
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,922
And it isn't just Glenn.

414
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,801
I get that
you're afraid.

415
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,970
I am.

416
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,223
I am afraid.

417
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,642
We could get there.

418
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,602
I know.

419
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,986
So let's go get Bob...

420
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,699
and let's get there.

421
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,009
Well, lookit here.

422
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,769
( grunts )

423
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,354
( guns cocking )

424
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,023
Damn it, hold up!

425
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,525
I'm claiming the vest.

426
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,527
I like them wings.

427
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,821
Hold up.

428
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,034
( laughing )

429
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,880
A bowman.

430
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,591
I respect that.

431
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,134
See, a man with a rifle,

432
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,178
he could have been some
kind of photographer

433
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,013
or soccer coach
back in the day.

434
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:55,100
But a bowman's a bowman
through and through.

435
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,394
What you got there,
150-pound draw weight?

436
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:01,899
I'll be donkey-licked if that don't fire
at least 300 feet per second.

437
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,402
I've been looking
for a weapon like that.

438
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,530
Of course, I'd want one
with a bit more ammo

439
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,533
and minus
the oblongata stains.

440
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,161
( laughs )

441
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,331
Get yourself in some
trouble, partner?

442
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,250
You pull that trigger,

443
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,920
these boys are gonna
drop you several times over.

444
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,130
That what you want?

445
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,759
Come on, fella,
suicide is stupid.

446
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,678
Why hurt yourself
when you can hurt other people?

447
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,854
Name's Joe.

448
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,235
Daryl.

449
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,614
