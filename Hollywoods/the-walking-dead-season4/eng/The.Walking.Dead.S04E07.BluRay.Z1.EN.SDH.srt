1
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,394
Your move, pumpkin.

2
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,854
I'm thinking.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,362
( panting )

4
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,704
Mitch, grab that.

5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,131
Go on.
( grunts )

6
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,815
Governor:
You can't think forever.

7
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,277
Sooner or later,
you've got to make a move.

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,197
You never let me win anyway.

9
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,242
Well, that wouldn't be winning.

10
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,704
That's what my daddy used to say.

11
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,251
He used to beat me at chess, too.

12
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,549
Heck, he used to beat me at everything.

13
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,610
You know this guy?

14
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,031
Was your dad mean?

15
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,366
Sometimes.

16
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,452
Were you bad?

17
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,456
Sometimes.

18
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,550
So you've been on the road
all this time?

19
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,096
Yeah.

20
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,308
Lily:
You okay, Brian?

21
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,246
What is it, pumpkin?

22
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,375
Am I bad?

23
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,837
What?

24
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,880
Hey.

25
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,509
Why would you think that?

26
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:01,305
My dad was always mean to me.

27
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,350
Hey, you're good.

28
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,478
You are.

29
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,689
We've got a camp
about a half a mile from here.

30
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,732
Hell, no, Martinez.

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,651
We got too many mouths as it is.

32
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,486
They got a kid, for Christ's sake.

33
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,281
Hey, if you do come back with us,
there's two things you got to accept.

34
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,366
One, I'm in charge.

35
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,910
Two, no deadweight.

36
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,746
That goes for everyone.

37
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:32,545
Contribute or be cast out.

38
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:38,092
Can you live with that, Brian?

39
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,889
Governor:
You, me, your mom, and Aunt Tara,

40
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,016
we're gonna be okay.

41
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,351
'Cause we're good?

42
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,186
All of us?

43
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,757
Your turn.

44
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,470
Brian?

45
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,265
It's your turn.

46
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,397
I'm thinking.

47
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,111
( wind blowing )

48
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,711
( theme music playing )

49
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,793
Lily:
You going out there today?

50
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,254
Supply run.

51
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,215
Martinez and the Dolgen brothers.

52
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,266
( sighs )

53
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,938
I'm gonna set up a nurses' station
for the camp.

54
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,606
They need one.

55
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,570
- I'm sorry, Lily. This place is--
- Stop it.

56
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,489
I wanted something better for us.

57
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,034
This camp is good.

58
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,202
We'll make it better.

59
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,055
How's the fishing?

60
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,640
There isn't any.
Pond's dead.

61
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,644
As a doornail.

62
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,608
We still got rabbits, skunks,
some possum out here.

63
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,527
You better watch your ass, One Eye Bri.

64
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,373
Mitch: You sure we're headed
in the right direction?

65
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,709
Martinez:
If Howard's map is right.

66
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,170
Mitch: We should have dragged
his ass out here to make sure.

67
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,214
He's an old man.
He can barely walk.

68
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,091
That's why I said dragged.

69
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,801
Hope this is worth it.

70
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,303
Supposedly this guy
was a survivalist type.

71
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,263
His cabin might have stuff we can use.

72
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,265
Hell, maybe he's still alive.

73
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,142
I won't keep my fingers crossed.

74
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,775
Hey, One Eye. What you doing?

75
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,721
The hell is this?

76
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,349
Mitch:
Somebody pissed somebody off.

77
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,853
Who gives a shit?

78
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,897
That guy's got nothing
to worry about anymore.

79
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,607
Let's go.

80
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,653
- It's a deep cut.
- No, that's nothing, ma'am.

81
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,823
I just got cute with my knife,
that's all. I'll be fine.

82
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,995
So...

83
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,705
Alicia.

84
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,416
Alicia. Right.

85
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,002
You in the Marines or something?

86
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,504
Army. In the reserves.

87
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,715
An M4, huh?

88
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,845
You don't approve?

89
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,056
I mean, don't get me wrong,

90
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,184
an M4 is great for close combat,

91
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,686
but as a field weapon?

92
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,939
With all that dirt and dust,
no, thanks.

93
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,985
I've never really been
into big guns anyway.

94
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,112
I'm more of a Smith & Wesson gal.

95
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,073
Less fuss, you know?

96
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,367
You always this full of shit?

97
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,952
( laughs )

98
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,872
Yes, I am.

99
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,527
Took himself out.

100
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,780
You think he's the one
who 86'd those military guys?

101
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,950
- He still has his head.
- Some of it, anyway.

102
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,460
Let's see what he's got inside.

103
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,016
( tapping )

104
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,060
- ( whistles )
- ( banging )

105
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,314
You hear that?
There's one in there.

106
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,733
Must be stuck if it ain't coming out.

107
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,693
We going in?

108
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,154
You want us to wait till you finish
pissing in your pants?

109
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,697
- No, I'm--
- Cut the chatter.

110
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,741
( bangs )

111
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,745
Hey. Let's go.

112
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,899
( banging continues )

113
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,206
( banging )

114
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,718
- It's close.
- Quiet.

115
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,679
( banging )

116
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,226
( banging )

117
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,962
- ( bangs )
- ( door creaks open )

118
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,423
- It's out.
- Shut up.

119
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,508
- ( snarls )
- Oh! Get it off of me!

120
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,593
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!

121
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,762
Get it off of me!

122
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,654
Jeez!

123
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,949
Pete!

124
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,286
( floorboards creak )

125
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,788
- ( snarls )
- ( gasps )

126
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,819
Martinez:
If it was just you in that pit,

127
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,948
I wouldn't have brought
you into the camp.

128
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,868
If it weren't for the people
you were with...

129
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,330
the girl...

130
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,799
You seem different now.

131
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,718
Changed.

132
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,804
Are you?

133
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,852
I am.

134
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,357
Good.

135
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,694
The guy had some good stuff.

136
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,740
Canned food.

137
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:32,037
Ooh. We got beer.

138
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,879
( whistles )

139
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,717
( laughs )

140
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,641
Pete:
Man, what happened here?

141
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,561
I mean, what the hell
was going on in this cabin?

142
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,563
Was he storing those biters?

143
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,731
They were his wife and kid, man.

144
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,734
Pete:
No, they were biters.

145
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,571
What about those heads?

146
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,740
Belonged to the guys who did
the wrong thing to the wrong man.

147
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,411
Probably best not to think
too much about it.

148
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,913
Better listen to One Eye Bri, Pete.

149
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,460
I can never tell if he's winking
or blinking.

150
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,924
But you know how to regulate,
don't you, Bri?

151
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,805
He was always like this, Martinez?

152
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,350
Oh, yeah. Ice in the veins.

153
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,603
You should have seen him
back in the day.

154
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,770
What about you fellas, huh?

155
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,939
What did you do before it all changed?

156
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,108
I was...

157
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,360
I was an ice cream truck driver.

158
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,279
( laughs )

159
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,781
Till I upgraded my life

160
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,785
and I became a tank operator
for the US Army.

161
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,704
Hoo-ah!

162
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,331
Hoo-ah.

163
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,583
Then when everything went tits up,

164
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,044
I got the hell out
and took my ride with me.

165
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:08,008
End of the world don't mean shit
when you got a tank.

166
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,220
I was Army, too.

167
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,765
Stationed out of Fort Benning.

168
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,309
Stayed for a while after it all started.

169
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,811
That's my Pete.

170
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,897
He's too loyal to bounce.

171
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,984
What about you, Brian?

172
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,362
What did you do when it all went bad?

173
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,908
I survived.

174
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,003
( laughing )

175
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,506
Wait, your father was a Catholic priest?

176
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,007
That's right.

177
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,759
So the father became a daddy?

178
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,845
It caused some problems
with the Church a little bit.

179
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,181
This is all stuff Brian's heard before.

180
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,016
We spent a lot of time
out there together.

181
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,936
You've done all right here.
I mean this camp.

182
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,689
It's the first time I've felt safe
since all this started.

183
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,024
The place Brian and I lived
before kind of worked.

184
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,526
I guess I wanted that again.

185
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,361
Sounds like your old camp
was pretty sweet.

186
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,571
Alicia:
You guys had walls, right?

187
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,200
Yeah. Yeah, it was...

188
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,285
it was a good place.

189
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,455
Megan:
This place is good, too, right?

190
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,125
Martinez:
You know it.

191
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,085
I want to hear all about it someday.

192
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,753
Brian won't say a word.

193
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,297
I say leave the past in the past.

194
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,552
Tara:
Well, for the first time in a long time,

195
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,470
- I'm shitfaced.
- Lily: Tara.

196
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,557
Sorry. Megan,
don't say that, okay?

197
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,143
- You want to get out of here?
- Yeah.

198
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,395
Thanks for the dinner.
Double thanks for the suds.

199
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,022
Yeah. Boom.
There you go.

200
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,317
( kisses )

201
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,945
- Be safe.
- Tara: Yep.

202
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,655
I think, um--
I think I'm gonna go.

203
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,242
You sure?
I got a couple of skunky beers left.

204
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,954
Whoa.
( laughing )

205
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,583
I'm good, thanks.

206
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,712
Brian, the roof's leaking again.

207
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,090
You should fix that, man.

208
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,134
I'll do that.

209
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,346
Later, muñeca.

210
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,686
( Governor sighs )

211
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,527
( knocks )

212
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,163
Almost forgot.
Got a surprise for you.

213
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
Whoa.

214
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,552
Martinez:
Aw, damn it.

215
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,721
Hand me another one.

216
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,520
You know he's dead, right?

217
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,147
Shumpert?

218
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,067
He was never the same after Woodbury.

219
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,529
Oh!

220
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,990
Yeah. He got reckless.

221
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,662
Biter took a piece of him
right over there.

222
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,374
I swear, he didn't try
to get out of the way.

223
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,876
I put him down myself.

224
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,504
Right over there.

225
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,131
I'm sorry.

226
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,260
There's some things
you just can't come back from.

227
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,262
They become a part of who you are.

228
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,597
Either you live with them or you don't.

229
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,600
Well, you seem to be living with them
pretty well.

230
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,019
( laughs )
So are you.

231
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,525
That family,
they brought you back.

232
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,195
You're lucky. I couldn't--

233
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,115
I couldn't do that again.
Couldn't risk it.

234
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,742
Couldn't sleep at night
knowing I was gonna lose them.

235
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,744
I'm not gonna lose them.

236
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,705
Yeah.

237
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:13,962
What, you don't think
you can keep this place safe?

238
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,714
I'll try.

239
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,925
Hopefully we'll be prepared
for whatever comes.

240
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:25,390
Now you're here,
maybe we can share the crown a little.

241
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,895
Oh, Jesus.

242
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,231
I should have taken some golf lessons
before the--

243
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,404
( groaning )

244
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,157
( groaning continues )

245
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,462
( screams )

246
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,343
( panting )

247
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,011
( golf club thuds )

248
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,642
Come on, let's go.

249
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,188
( walkers snarling )

250
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,108
Come on.

251
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,945
I don't wanna do it!

252
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,700
( screaming )

253
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,119
I don't want it!
I don't want it!

254
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,288
( shouts )

255
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,457
You hear me?
I don't want it, damn it!

256
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,834
( screaming )

257
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,510
I don't want it.

258
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,595
( flesh tearing )

259
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,847
I don't want it.

260
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,905
( crying )

261
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,283
- ( door opens )
- Brian, we're home!

262
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,244
Lily:
Megan, he's sleeping.

263
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,999
Brian?

264
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,918
You're shaking.

265
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,424
What is it?

266
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,678
I just had a bad dream, that's all.

267
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,355
What was it?

268
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,234
I can't remember.

269
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,864
Listen up!

270
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:50,452
We found what was left of Martinez
in a pit this morning.

271
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,121
( crowd murmuring )

272
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,540
Looks like he was
hitting some golf balls,

273
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,625
he got drunk,

274
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,419
he fell in.

275
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,464
( crowd murmuring )

276
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,050
So now what?

277
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,969
I'm taking leadership of the camp.

278
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,430
- Crowd: No. No.
- Hold on now. Hold on now!

279
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:13,391
We should vote on who leads, right?

280
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,061
- Yeah.
- You can't just take over.

281
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,229
- Shut your mouth, you little bitch.
- What?

282
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,690
- Hey!
- Pete: Hey, calm down!

283
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,609
Calm down, all of you.

284
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,075
We need each other
now more than ever.

285
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,662
The only way we get through this,
through any of this, is together.

286
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,124
Now this is temporary.

287
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,960
We'll find some kind of way to do a vote
in the next couple of days.

288
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,420
For now, it's business as usual.

289
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,757
- Okay?
- ( crowd murmuring )

290
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,598
You heard the man.

291
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,310
Move!

292
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,273
Please?

293
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,485
Gear up.
We're going on a hunt.

294
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,159
Pete:
Rationing, fences, medical supplies.

295
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:17,122
There are 100 questions and people
are looking to me for answers.

296
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,666
Well, it's hard to lead.

297
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,043
Yeah, I could use some help.

298
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,464
Hey.

299
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,472
( people chatting )

300
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,735
How many?

301
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,572
10.

302
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,199
Maybe less.

303
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,494
They got a lot of supplies, though.

304
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,330
Maybe we should take 'em in.

305
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,332
Are you crazy?

306
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,085
We barely got enough
to go around as it is.

307
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,007
Look, Pete, I know you don't want
to hurt nobody.

308
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,509
Neither do I,
but we need those supplies.

309
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,013
Now let's just go over there
and take what we need and go home.

310
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,848
No rough stuff.

311
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,349
- You want to rob 'em?
- Why not?

312
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,560
We need their stuff.

313
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,273
They got guns,
but if we roll up on 'em quick--

314
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,358
No.

315
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,486
No, we can find our own supplies.

316
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,155
Come on.

317
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,845
- What a joke.
- We did all right.

318
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:59,057
Yeah, a couple of damn squirrels,
some condensed milk.

319
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,017
What do you want from me?
I'm trying here.

320
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,859
Hey.

321
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,527
Where you going?

322
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,717
Son of a bitch.

323
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,428
Son of a bitch!

324
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,140
This wasn't biters.

325
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,602
People did this.
Must have just happened.

326
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,479
We would have had those supplies.

327
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,440
You're worried about supplies?
These people are dead, Mitch.

328
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,942
You're damn right they're dead!

329
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,819
That was gonna happen either way.

330
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,446
Now some other group's got our stuff.

331
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,118
( moaning weakly )

332
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,791
Mitch. Mitch, no!

333
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,974
He might have lived.

334
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,143
Might have.

335
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,499
Here you go. Need this?

336
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,840
Brian, what's going on?

337
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,176
- Pack your things, now.
- What's happening?

338
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,179
- Lily: Hold on, baby.
- Hey.

339
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,182
Grab your clothes, pack some food.
Come on.

340
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,767
Mommy?

341
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,019
- Brian, stop.
- Get Tara.

342
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,189
We need to leave.
It isn't safe here anymore.

343
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,691
What are you talking about?

344
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,693
We can't just run off.

345
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,613
I'm the only nurse in camp.
Tara's got Alicia.

346
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,323
What about Megan?

347
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,034
Look, things are about to go
very wrong here.

348
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,870
It's happened to me before.
I can't put you and Megan through that.

349
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,997
Can't lose you again.

350
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,542
What about Pete?

351
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,211
You said he was a good man.

352
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,630
- Well, I was wrong.
- But...

353
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,257
Do you trust me?

354
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,218
Do you trust me, Lily?

355
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,556
Then pack your things.

356
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,725
We're leaving tonight, okay?

357
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,685
Come on.

358
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,313
Mommy.

359
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,357
Mommy.

360
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,403
Alicia:
Where are we going?

361
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,571
- Tara: Alicia.
- Maybe you should slow down.

362
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,698
No, I don't understand this.
I don't understand this.

363
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,492
Tara:
Hey, we're together, okay?

364
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,412
We have everything back there.
We have food, we have shelter.

365
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,080
- ( tires skid )
- ( gasps )

366
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,250
( walkers snarling )

367
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,002
- Brian.
- Oh, my God.

368
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,255
Just stay in the car.

369
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,717
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( slopping )

370
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,349
What are you doing?

371
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,356
Surviving.

372
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,152
( door opens )

373
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,708
( knocks )

374
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,924
We need to talk.

375
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,218
About Mitch.

376
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,221
Come in.

377
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,724
I knew this was coming.

378
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,893
I've been getting him
out of trouble my--

379
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,063
( muffled cries )

380
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,410
Shh. Shh.

381
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,615
Where's Pete?

382
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,119
He's dead.

383
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,249
You gonna kill me, too, now?

384
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,754
Huh? For the old guy at the camp?

385
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,685
Smoke?

386
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,482
Why did you do my brother?

387
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,485
You were right about that camp.
We should have taken their supplies.

388
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,364
I don't care that you killed
the old man.

389
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,909
Men like your brother,
always doing the right thing,

390
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,037
even at the cost of their own people.

391
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,167
Go on. Have a cigarette.

392
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,461
I quit.

393
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,506
Yeah, me, too.

394
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,093
I remember the first smoke I ever had.

395
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,345
Me and my brother
huddled in the garage

396
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,348
puffing on one of my dad's
Lucky Strikes.

397
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,017
He must have smelled the smoke,
because he came barging in

398
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,144
looking to beat up on us.

399
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,522
But my brother got between us.

400
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,818
Said he stole them.

401
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,238
Wasn't true. It was me.

402
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,865
But that was my brother.

403
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,704
Hero.

404
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,543
He got two black eyes
and a broken rib for that.

405
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,212
And I got beat anyway.

406
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,550
Take one.

407
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,782
I'm running things now,

408
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,578
and I will do everything it takes
to protect this camp.

409
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,914
Now, if you join me,

410
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,667
I promise you you will never have to
worry about whether you were doing

411
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,627
the right thing or the wrong thing.

412
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,256
Because we will do

413
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,426
the only thing.

414
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,787
Mitch: What are we gonna tell
the camp about Pete?

415
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,708
Governor: We'll tell them
he died on a supply run,

416
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,960
saving our asses.

417
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,260
Mitch: You think they're really
gonna believe that?

418
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,513
Governor: People believe
what they want to believe.

419
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,102
Everybody loves a hero.

420
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,906
( chatter )

421
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,245
Governor:
How's the perimeter coming?

422
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,831
Alicia: It's good. We got cars ringing
almost the entire camp.

423
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,708
I think a few more runs, we should
have ourselves a nice little buffer.

424
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,876
Governor:
And the pits?

425
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,586
Mitch: They keep coming,
we keep burning them.

426
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,046
I don't know
if it's the heat or what,

427
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,881
but there have been a hell
of a lot more of them lately.

428
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,383
- And the armory?
- Solid.

429
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,593
I rounded up
all the ammo in camp.

430
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,012
We're officially stocked
in the bullet department.

431
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,933
Still, tell your crews supply runs
are arrow only from now on.

432
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,768
Gunshots are a luxury.

433
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,562
Sooner or later
we're gonna need 'em.

434
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,107
That's right,
and not just for the biters.

435
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,902
Mitch and I and Pete, we saw
what people can do out there.

436
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,072
You come across strangers,
you just avoid them.

437
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,366
Come back here and tell us
where you saw them, okay?

438
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,618
Let's go.

439
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,370
( whispering )

440
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,796
( sighs )

441
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,638
Maybe we can find a better place.

442
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,731
You know, if...

443
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,233
we're willing to fight for it.

444
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,904
We don't need to find a better place.

445
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,702
This is home.

446
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,839
You're it, Aunt Tara.

447
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,966
What? I can't be it.
I'm on guard duty.

448
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,510
I have to be a responsible adult.

449
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,930
- You're it.
- Go get her.

450
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,556
- No fair!
- Run, Megan.

451
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,266
( laughs )

452
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:25,970
You don't have to do this alone.

453
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,521
Caught you.

454
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,148
- ( snarling )
- ( screaming )

455
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,907
Aunt Tara!
( screaming )

456
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,325
Megan!

457
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,246
Aunt Tara! No!

458
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,581
( screaming )

459
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,341
( gunshot )

460
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,052
- Mommy!
- Megan!

461
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,097
- Man: It's your fault!
- Woman: It's not.

462
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,523
It's okay. It's okay.

463
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,650
It's okay.

464
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,007
( chatter )

465
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,279
( cocks gun )

466
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,043
( theme music playing )
