You didn't wake me up.

20
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,570
'Cause I knew you were up all night
reading comics with a flashlight.

21
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,202
Carl:
What's up with Violet?

22
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,454
Carl, I told you
not to name them.

23
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,706
They're not piglets anymore.
They're food.

24
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,668
I just thought,
you know, until...

25
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,004
Okay.

26
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,301
I don't know
what's going on with her.

27
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,137
Could be sick,
could be nothing.

28
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,931
( clicking tongue )

29
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,141
Feel better, Violet.

30
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,062
Come on, let's get to it.

31
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,649
- Morning, Daryl.
- What's up, Dr. S?

32
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,234
- Man: Morning, Daryl.
- Man #2: Morning, Daryl.

33
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,819
Woman:
Hey, Daryl!

34
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,196
Smells good.

35
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,740
Just so you know,
I liked you first.

36
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,534
Stop.

37
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,788
You know, Rick brought in
a lot of them, too.

38
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,666
Not recently.

39
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,420
Give the stranger sanctuary,
keeping people fed,

40
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,213
you're gonna have to learn
to live with the love.

41
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,008
- Right.
- I need you to see something.

42
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,551
Patrick, you want to take over?

43
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,386
Yes, ma'am.

44
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,016
Mr. Dixon,

45
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,227
I just wanted to thank you for bringing
that deer back yesterday.

46
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,438
It was a real treat, sir.

47
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,815
And I'd be honored
to shake your hand.

48
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,372
( growling )

49
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,076
About today,

50
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,663
I don't know if we're gonna be able
to spare a lot of people for the run.

51
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,873
That place is good to go.
We're gonna move on it.

52
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,125
Yeah.

53
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,462
The thing is, we had
a pretty big buildup overnight.

54
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,881
Dozens more
towards tower three.

55
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,176
It's getting as bad
as last month.

56
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,886
They don't spread out
anymore.

57
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,514
With more of us sitting here,
we're drawing more of them out.

58
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,433
You get enough of those damn
fence-clingers, they start to herd up.

59
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,519
Pushing against
the fences again.

60
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,730
It's manageable, but unless
we get ahead of it, not for long.

61
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,857
Sorry, Pookie.

62
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,236
( scoffs )

63
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,238
( snarling )

64
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,248
You like that?

65
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,518
( sighs )

66
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,738
I don't think
you should go today.

67
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,992
Really?

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,702
Yeah.

69
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,541
We have the suits.

70
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,752
Yeah, but you don't
have to go.

71
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,712
You shouldn't.

72
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,301
You know everything's
gonna work out, right?

73
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,055
Right?

74
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,058
Right.

75
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,727
Right.

76
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,897
But you're staying, okay?

77
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,026
Fine.

78
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,322
Hey, beautiful.

79
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,157
Hey yourself.

80
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,993
- You need an apron.
- Yeah.

81
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,412
Listen, can we talk?

82
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,628
I was thinking of going
on the run today.

83
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,213
Okay.

84
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,257
I don't like killing
them on the fence.

85
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,218
I hate it.

86
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:11,013
I mean, when they're coming at you
out there, it's different.

87
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,848
You don't even
think about it.

88
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,559
When they're stacked up
against the chain-link,

89
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,562
you're just face-to-face.

90
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,564
I...

91
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,486
I just wanted to do something different
to help out.

92
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,241
You always volunteered
to do it.

93
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,409
That's because you
were always doing it.

94
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,662
( laughs )

95
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,498
Just thought I could
get to know you.

96
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,630
You did.

97
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,426
You be careful out there.

98
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,772
Hey.

99
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,983
I was just gonna
come find you.

100
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,946
- Hi.
- What's up?

101
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,283
Well, the council pulled back everyone
on the coal crew

102
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,160
from going on the run.

103
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,953
They're shorthanded
right now.

104
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,247
I figured I'd step up
to help, go with 'em.

105
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,585
Just, you know, wanted to make sure
that I saw you before.

106
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,254
Okay.

107
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,755
I just--
'cause, you know,

108
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,175
it's dangerous
going out there.

109
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,594
I know.
( kisses )

110
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,140
Okay, are you
gonna say good-bye?

111
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,766
Nope.

112
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,060
It's like a damn
romance novel.

113
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,613
Hey.

114
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,615
I'd like to start pulling
my weight around here.

115
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,033
Bob, it's only been a week.

116
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,868
That's a week
worth of meals,

117
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,953
a roof over my head.

118
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,914
Let me earn my keep.

119
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,252
You were out on your own
when Daryl found you.

120
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,046
- That's right.
- I just want to make sure

121
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,505
you know how to play on a team.

122
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,257
We ain't gonna do it
unless it's easy.

123
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,176
You know he was
a medic in the Army.

124
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,225
You a hell of a tough sell.
You know that?

125
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,686
Okay.

126
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,647
( engines start )

127
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,400
These leaves are gonna be
in the shade,

128
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,528
so we won't get
any good fruit from it.

129
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,698
So we just pinch
it off here.

130
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,703
Things break,
but they can still grow.

131
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,790
These little bristles,
they'll take root

132
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,959
and we'll have
a whole new plant.

133
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,378
( whistles )

134
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,630
Rick:
Let's go.

135
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,841
( growling )

136
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,269
( grunts )

137
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,915
We're glad to see you.

138
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,167
Glad to see you, too.

139
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,044
Somebody hit
the jackpot.

140
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,963
No way.

141
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,549
Awesome!
Thank you.

142
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,967
I get to read 'em
when you're done.

143
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,636
And I found this.

144
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,183
Your face
is losing the war.

145
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,685
( chuckles )

146
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,271
You gonna stay
a little while?

147
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,315
Just a little while.

148
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,066
( motorcycle revving )

149
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,242
Well, look who's back.

150
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,911
Didn't find him.

151
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,957
Glad to see you
in one piece.

152
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,001
I'm thinking of looking
over near Macon.

153
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,338
It's worth a shot.

154
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,548
Daryl:
70 miles of walkers.

155
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,343
You might run into
a few unneighborly types.

156
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,219
Is it?

157
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,350
I'm gonna go check out
the Big Spot.

158
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,102
The one I was talking about,
just seeing.

159
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,688
Rick: Yeah, I got to go out
and check the snares.

160
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,274
I don't want to lose whatever
we catch to the walkers.

161
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,650
I'll go.

162
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,361
You just got here.

163
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,197
And I'll be back.

164
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,701
( revs motor )

165
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,120
( engine starts )

166
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,793
( growling )

167
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,590
- Going to check the snares?
- I am.

168
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,259
You're not.
Do your chores.

169
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,678
Read comics.
Maybe some books, too.

170
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,098
Hang out with Patrick.

171
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,141
Maybe go to story time.

172
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,268
Dad, that's for kids.

173
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,187
Yeah.

174
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,690
Now brush her down.

175
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,743
Nothing wrong with
staying close, Rick.

176
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,204
Everyone understands.

177
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,914
You're growing us
enough food

178
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,125
so we won't need
to do runs soon.

179
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,461
But we do have to find you
a good pair of overalls.

180
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,880
You need to look
the part.

181
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,174
A little piece of wheat
out of the corner of your mouth.

182
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,676
Maybe a bigger ass.

183
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,554
( laughs )
Yeah.

184
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,141
Listen, the rest
of the council--

185
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,018
Daryl, Glenn,
Carol, Sasha,

186
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,313
all of them--

187
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,607
they wanted me
to talk to you.

188
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,360
When you go out there,

189
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,529
you got to take your gun.

190
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,323
- ( horse snorts )
- Easy now.

191
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,659
It's just
outside the fence.

192
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,786
I have my knife.

193
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,456
I get in trouble, six bullets
isn't gonna make the difference.

194
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,334
Rick, we want you
to be safe.

195
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,005
Bring your gun.

196
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,347
( flies buzzing )

197
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,155
( grunting )

198
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,247
( rustling )

199
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,133
Wait.

200
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,137
Please.

201
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,811
Please?

202
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,152
Please help me.

203
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,825
I know you don't
know me.

204
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,828
Okay, I know that.

205
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,666
But can you please help me
get this to my husband?

206
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,045
We haven't eaten in days.

207
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,153
Here. Go ahead.

208
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,538
Thank you.

209
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,925
Do you have a camp
around here?

210
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,346
Yeah.

211
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,101
Could we possibly
come back with you?

212
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,397
We've been doing...

213
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,150
very badly on our own.

214
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,535
I'd have to meet him.

215
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,373
I need to ask him some questions,
both of you.

216
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,085
What questions?

217
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,839
Just three.
When we get there.

218
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,177
You have a gun
on you?

219
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,347
Can I make sure?

220
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,106
Yeah.

221
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,653
Look, I don't know you,

222
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,656
so I'm just gonna
tell you this.

223
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,242
You try anything--

224
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,579
anything--

225
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,542
you're gonna be
the one who loses.

226
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,838
I don't have
anything else to lose.

227
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,801
No.

228
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,220
You do.

229
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,059
Go ahead.

230
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,278
( growling )

231
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,114
Child:
Nick, look over here.

232
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,241
Child #2:
This one's Wayne.

233
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,492
- Nick.
- Nick, over here.

234
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,827
Hi, Nick!

235
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,079
- Hi, Nick.
- Carl: You're naming them?

236
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,456
Well, one of them
has a name tag,

237
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,209
so we thought
all of them should.

238
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,795
They had names when they were alive.
They're dead now.

239
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,256
No, they're not.
They're just different.

240
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,757
What the hell
are you talking about?

241
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,843
Okay, they don't talk.

242
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,846
They don't think.
They eat people.

243
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,347
They kill people.

244
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,433
People kill people.
They still have names.

245
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,351
Have you seen
what happens?

246
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,562
Have you seen someone
die like that?

247
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,357
Yeah, I have.

248
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,569
They're not people
and they're not pets.

249
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,029
Don't name them.

250
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,450
We're supposed to go read.
Come on.

251
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,039
You coming to
story time tonight?

252
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,168
Uh, yeah.

253
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,544
See you then.

254
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,216
I go sometimes.
I'm immature.

255
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,927
You wouldn't dig it.
It's for kids.

256
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,514
I'm gonna head
up there, too.

257
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,433
I'll catch you later,
young sir.

258
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,560
Yep.

259
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,687
Army came in
and put these fences up.

260
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,689
Made it a place
for the people to go.

261
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,858
Last week when we
spotted this place,

262
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,360
there was a bunch of walkers
behind this chain-link

263
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,697
keeping people out
like a bunch of guard dogs.

264
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,199
( music blaring
over radio )

265
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,867
So they all just left?

266
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,744
Give a listen.

267
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,788
( music continues playing )

268
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,706
You drew 'em out.

269
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,541
Put a boom box out there
three days ago.

270
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,668
Hooked it up
to two car batteries.

271
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,671
All right,
let's make a sweep.

272
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,840
Make sure it's safe.
Grab what you can.

273
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,550
We'll come back tomorrow
with more people.

274
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,652
Come on.

275
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,284
( pounding )

276
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,537
Just give it a second.

277
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,917
Okay, I think
I got it.

278
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,003
Got what?

279
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,507
I've been trying to guess what Daryl
did before the turn.

280
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,592
He's been trying to guess
for, like, six weeks.

281
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,553
Yeah, I'm pacing myself.

282
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,513
One shot a day.

283
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,682
All right, shoot.

284
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,895
Well, the way you are
at the prison,

285
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,773
you being on the council,
you're able to track,

286
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,151
you're helping people,
but you're still being kind of...

287
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,571
surly.

288
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,824
Big swing here.

289
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,119
Homicide cop.

290
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,954
( laughing )

291
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,373
What's so funny?

292
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,543
Nothing.
It makes perfect sense.

293
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,753
Actually,
the man's right.

294
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,839
Undercover.

295
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,759
- Come on, really?
- Yep.

296
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,553
I don't like to talk about it

297
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,723
'cause it was a lot
of heavy shit, you know?

298
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,519
Dude, come on, really?

299
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,315
( clears throat )

300
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,984
Okay. I'll just keep
guessing, I guess.

301
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,694
- Yeah, you keep doing that.
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,738
( snarling )

303
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,240
- We're gonna do this, Detective?
- Let's do it.

304
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,201
( doors open )

305
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,874
All right, we go in,
stay in formation for the sweep.

306
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,709
After that, you all know
what you're supposed to look for.

307
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,336
Any questions?

308
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,212
Was there ever a time
that you weren't the boss of me?

309
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,881
You had a few years
before I was born.

310
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,820
( growling )

311
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,838
( birds chirping )

312
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,133
We were going
to Puerto Vallarta

313
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,302
for our honeymoon.

314
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,222
When they shut down
the airports,

315
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,308
our connecting flight
never connected.

316
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,562
They wouldn't let us
leave the terminal, so...

317
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,150
we slept
next to these huge

318
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,404
marble sculptures
from Zimbabwe.

319
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,866
Then,
on the fourth night,

320
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,370
the things
just came through.

321
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,789
There were
a lot of us and...

322
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,543
now it's just
Eddie and me.

323
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,088
And I wouldn't
have made it

324
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,382
if it wasn't for him.

325
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,635
And it isn't that...

326
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:32,392
he saved me
over and over again

327
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,061
or that he showed me
the things

328
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,231
that I had to do or...

329
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,400
to be willing to do.

330
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,071
If he wasn't still here...

331
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,450
I-- I couldn't be.

332
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,620
I just-- I couldn't.

333
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,707
What were they?

334
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,375
What?

335
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,796
The things you had
to be willing to do?

336
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,631
Um...

337
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,010
eating whatever
we could find--

338
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,304
animal carcasses

339
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,474
and rotten fruit-- and...

340
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,311
leaving people behind.

341
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,983
Hiding from people
who needed my help.

342
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,071
Unlike you.

343
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,786
This is not charity.

344
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,829
You have to have numbers.

345
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,665
People are the best
defense against walkers

346
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,793
or people.

347
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,711
We help each other.

348
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,298
You call them "walkers"?

349
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,104
( yelling )

350
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,523
( growling )

351
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,080
You all right?
You cut or something?

352
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,249
No, man, but my foot is caught.

353
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,085
All right. He's just caught.
Come on, help me up.

354
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,420
- Glenn: What happened?
- Everyone's all right.

355
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,963
We're over in wine and beer.

356
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,929
( roof creaking )

357
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,098
I was moving fast, man.
I drove right into the drinks.

358
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,435
Man, you lucked out. If this thing had
come down on you the wrong way...

359
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,365
( snarling )

360
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,659
Yeah, uh, we should
probably go now.

361
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,410
Bob's still stuck.
Get him out of there.

362
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,246
We'll get the others.

363
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,265
Hey!

364
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:52,527
I saw those sculptures
at the airport once.

365
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,613
My favorite was the kids
playing leapfrog.

366
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,575
Mine, too.

367
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,289
What Eddie and I had to do,

368
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,041
did you do things like that?

369
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,255
Did you?

370
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,594
Do you think you get
to come back from them?

371
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,933
I hope so.

372
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,643
Yeah?

373
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,479
I hope we answer
your three questions

374
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,648
to your satisfaction.

375
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,193
( growling )

376
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,959
( grunting )

377
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,254
( snarling )

378
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,429
( grunting )

379
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,656
( machine-gun gunfire )

380
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,617
( clicks )

381
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,346
Hey!

382
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,598
( growling )

383
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,560
Hey!

384
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,631
Daryl, go!

385
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,689
( gunfire )

386
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,941
Let's get Bob.

387
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,450
- ( grunting )
- Bob: More, more.

388
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,743
Come on, time to go.

389
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,329
Let's go, now!
Come on! Go!

390
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,582
- Let's get out of here!
- Ah!

391
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,334
( shouting )

392
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,381
( screaming )

393
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,925
- Zack!
- ( screaming )

394
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,388
Go, go!

395
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,975
Come on!

396
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,399
It's just ahead.

397
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,361
Eddie.

398
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,449
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

399
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,117
This is Rick.

400
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,536
He's gonna help us.

401
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,458
Everything's gonna
be okay.

402
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,836
Everything--
( breathing heavily )

403
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,550
- ( blade scrapes )
- ( shouting )

404
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,762
Damn it!

405
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,014
( sobbing )

406
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,977
I wanted to take
the boar.

407
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,814
I just knew-- I knew I'd get you here
so much quicker.

408
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,110
He's starving.

409
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,447
He's slowing.
He needs something alive.

410
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:15,456
Please, I told you,
I can't be without him.

411
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,294
And so I kept him.

412
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,630
It was wrong.

413
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,591
( breathing heavily )

414
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,302
I can't do things like this.

415
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,890
And-- and you have to do
things like this.

416
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,142
Let me be like him.

417
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,687
Don't stop it.

418
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,814
Don't end it after.

419
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,483
- No.
- Let me be with him.

420
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:44,986
No!

421
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,655
( groans )

422
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,157
( gasping )

423
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,955
( groans )

424
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,386
Hey.

425
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,732
What were...

426
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,067
the questions?

427
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:29,614
The three questions?

428
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,035
How many walkers
have you killed?

429
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,084
Eddie--

430
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,462
Eddie killed--
killed them all.

431
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,341
Until...
( gasping )

432
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,972
How many people
have you killed?

433
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,854
Just me.

434
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,856
Just me.

435
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,818
Why?

436
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,284
( gasping )

437
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,457
You don't--

438
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,168
you don't get
to come back.

439
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,881
You don't get
to come back

440
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,634
from things.

441
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,719
You don't...

442
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,888
( gasping )

443
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,835
( growling )

444
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,598
"The children fastened their eyes
upon their bit of candle

445
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:23,644
and watched it melt
slowly and pitilessly away.

446
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,523
Saw the half inch of wick
stand alone at last.

447
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,234
Saw the feeble flame
rise and fall.

448
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,821
Climb the thin tower
of smoke.

449
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,575
Linger at its top
a moment and then..."

450
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,458
Ma'am, should I take watch now?

451
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,626
Yes, Luke, you do that.

452
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,171
Today...

453
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,299
we are talking about knives--
how to use them,

454
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,885
how to be safe with them,
and how they could save your life.

455
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,344
Patrick: Ma'am,
may I be dismissed?

456
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,639
- What is it?
- I'm not feeling very well.

457
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,850
Sometimes you're gonna
have to fight through it.

458
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,102
What if you wind up
out there alone?

459
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,980
You just give up
because you're feeling bad?

460
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:12,818
No, it's just I don't want
to yack on somebody.

461
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,530
Go.

462
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,162
Okay, today we're gonna
learn how to hold a knife,

463
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:28,125
how to stab and slash
and where to aim for.

464
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,342
Please, don't tell your father.

465
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,311
( growling )

466
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,692
( growling )

467
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,200
What?

468
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,662
I don't like going out there, either.

469
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,299
( sighs )
Daryl's telling Beth.

470
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,634
There's nothing else to do.

471
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,929
I'll go see her.

472
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,310
I'm not pregnant.

473
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,687
- You know?
- I know.

474
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,108
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

475
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,152
Oh, my God.

476
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,156
I didn't want to,
but we could have.

477
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,492
We can have lives here.

478
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,747
How can you say that
after today?

479
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,457
After Lori?

480
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,627
Because I don't want to be
afraid of being alive.

481
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:41,467
Being afraid
is what's kept us alive.

482
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,053
No.

483
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,221
It's how we kept breathing.

484
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,022
Hey.

485
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,191
Hi.

486
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,528
What is it?

487
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,447
( sighs )

488
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,532
Zack.

489
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,206
Is he dead?

490
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,549
Okay.

491
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,279
What?

492
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,246
I don't cry anymore, Daryl.

493
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,376
I'm just glad I got
to know him, you know?

494
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,545
Me, too.

495
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,841
Are you okay?

496
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,554
Just tired of losing people is all.

497
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,604
I'm glad I didn't say good-bye.

498
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,524
I hate good-byes.

499
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,446
Me, too.

500
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,548
You tried to help her.

501
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,426
You couldn't.
No one could.

502
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,345
Some people are too far gone.

503
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,347
You're not.

504
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,141
You tried to help her.

505
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,268
How that woman wound up,

506
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,562
I got close to that.

507
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,817
If I lost Carl and Judith,
if I lost this place--

508
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,820
Not then, Rick.
Not even then.

509
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,158
You came back.

510
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,368
Your boy came back.

511
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,164
You get to come back.
You do.

512
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,509
( sighs )

513
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,677
( coughing )

514
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,767
( coughing )

515
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,269
( breathing heavily )

516
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,946
( coughing )

517
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,719
( coughing )

518
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,776
( panting )

519
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,449
( wheezing )

520
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,417
( theme music playing )
