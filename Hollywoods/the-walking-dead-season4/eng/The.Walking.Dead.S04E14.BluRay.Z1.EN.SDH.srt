You can sleep, Lizzie.
I'm okay.

14
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,402
If there's trouble,
I can take Judith.

15
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,237
I can help.

16
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,698
You really think
you can help me?

17
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,867
I know I can, ma'am.

18
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,292
Do you think there'll
be kids there?

19
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,586
At Terminus?

20
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,047
If their parents
kept them safe.

21
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,382
Like Tyreese kept
all of you safe.

22
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,385
I saved Tyreese.

23
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,888
There were people
shooting at him.

24
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,057
I shot them.

25
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,353
First a man,
then a woman.

26
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,235
I didn't mean
to shoot her in the head.

27
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,403
You had to.

28
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,657
You saved Tyreese.

29
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,245
Maybe there'll
be kids there,

30
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,081
even if their parents
couldn't keep them safe.

31
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,583
Maybe the kids kept
their parents safe.

32
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,794
Yeah.

33
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,423
Did you have kids?

34
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,342
I did.

35
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,094
A kid.

36
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,054
A daughter.

37
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,848
What was she like?

38
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,768
She was sweet.

39
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,107
She didn't have
a mean bone in her body.

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,236
Is that why
she isn't here now?

41
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,115
Yeah.

42
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,079
Do you miss her?

43
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,290
Every day.

44
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,169
Would you miss me?

45
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,674
I'm not gonna
have to miss you.

46
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,386
You're dead on your feet.

47
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,888
Go sleep next
to your sister, okay?

48
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,389
But, ma'am,
I can help.

49
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,266
I'm gonna need your help
looking after things tomorrow.

50
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,518
Go to sleep, okay?

51
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,529
Go.

52
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,161
No.

53
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,080
( grunts )
No.

54
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,042
( Tyreese murmuring )

55
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,586
No, no.

56
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,546
No, no. No.

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,138
Found some.

58
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,058
There you go.
Good job.

59
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,029
Ow.

60
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,491
- It hurts, right?
- Oh, yeah. It hurts.

61
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,035
This will fight
the infection.

62
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,287
Might even bring
down your fever.

63
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,668
What do you think?

64
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,879
Three days out?
Four days?

65
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,548
We haven't seen any of those maps
at the crossings.

66
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,676
I'm not sure.

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,805
Lizzie's tough.

68
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,059
When it comes
to people.

69
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,395
What do you mean?

70
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,481
You haven't seen it?

71
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,859
How she's confused
about them, the walkers.

72
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,278
She doesn't see
what they are.

73
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,739
She thinks
they're just different.

74
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,624
Tyreese:
Mica the same way?

75
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,751
No, she's worse.

76
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,131
She doesn't have
a mean bone in her body.

77
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,593
Mica:
Did "Tom Sawyer" have a happy ending?

78
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,096
We never
got to finish it.

79
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,932
Well, Tom and Huck,

80
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,601
they stop Injun Joe
and his partner

81
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,562
and wind up
getting all his gold.

82
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,939
- So they wind up rich?
- Mm-hmm.

83
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,233
And the Widow Douglas
adopts Huck.

84
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,901
Like you adopted us?

85
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,904
Yeah, I'm just like
the Widow Douglas.

86
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,282
And I'm Huck Finn.

87
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,160
I think you're more
like Tom Sawyer.

88
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,454
Yeah, you're right.

89
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,414
You're way more
like Huck Finn.

90
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,250
You're not even grossed out
by dead rabbits.

91
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,836
Forgot you used
to read to them.

92
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,381
I did.

93
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,845
Terminus.

94
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,222
Terminus.

95
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,476
( giggles )
Terminus.

96
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,770
I am a robot.

97
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,065
Come live with me
at Terminus

98
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,901
where we have
robot parties

99
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,904
and dance
with our robot friends.

100
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,239
Terminus.

101
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,284
( laughing )

102
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,752
( snarling )

103
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,300
Lizzie, don't.

104
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,844
- What?
- Eyes forward.

105
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,192
- You smell that?
- Yeah.

106
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,528
There's a fire somewhere.

107
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,572
Must be a big one.
It isn't anywhere around here.

108
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,869
We should stop here.
We need to look for water.

109
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,038
I can do it.

110
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,999
No, you need to rest.
Rest your arm.

111
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,043
Mica will help me.

112
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,387
I spy trees and weeds.

113
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,557
Your turn.

114
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,277
Here.
You stay here.

115
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,684
( snarling )

116
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,241
Tyreese.

117
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,205
Sometimes we have
to kill them.

118
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,333
I know that.
But sometimes we don't.

119
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,835
( Judith crying )

120
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,130
( growling )

121
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,550
You know Lizzie can carry
a lot more than me.

122
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,637
I had you come because
I wanted to talk to you.

123
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,138
Why?

124
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,057
Because you're little
and you're sweet

125
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,684
and those are two things
that can get you killed.

126
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,103
You can't change
how big you are...

127
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,980
I wish I could.

128
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,649
...but you can
toughen up.

129
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,151
I don't have
to be tough.

130
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,820
I can run.
I'm good at that.

131
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,073
No.

132
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,369
My daughter ran
and it wasn't enough.

133
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,415
That's why I taught the kids
at the prison to do more than that.

134
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,709
I can kill walkers.

135
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,878
I mean, I've tried.

136
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm not like my sister.
I'm not messed up.

137
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,718
I know what they are.

138
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,096
But I can't kill people.

139
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,847
I could never do that.

140
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,602
When the bad people
were at the prison,

141
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,604
they were right
in front of us

142
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,274
and I held up my gun,

143
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,484
but I couldn't
pull the trigger.

144
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,862
Killing people is wrong.

145
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,282
Someone killed
Karen and David.

146
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,201
They just killed them.
They were nice.

147
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,203
What about people
who try to kill you?

148
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,248
I don't even
wish I could.

149
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:31,171
People came in
and killed our friends.

150
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,300
And I feel sorry
for them.

151
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,719
Why?

152
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,180
Because they probably
weren't like that before.

153
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,766
Sooner or later
you're gonna have to do it.

154
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,144
You'll have to do it
or you'll die.

155
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,479
So you're gonna change
the way you think about it.

156
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,773
You have to change.
Everyone does now.

157
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,692
Things don't
just work out.

158
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,569
Look.

159
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,584
My mom used to say everything
works out the way it's supposed to.

160
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,727
Mica:
What are these?

161
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,147
- Carol: Pecans.
- Oh, I love pecans.

162
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,900
You know, maybe we could
catch our breath here for a while.

163
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,698
We're still going
to Terminus, right?

164
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,451
We'll just stay
a day or two.

165
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,453
There's a well
full of water.

166
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,121
Fences.

167
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,664
They're not big,
but they're something.

168
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,416
And we saw deer.
They eat pecans.

169
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,043
We should be able
to kill one to eat.

170
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,836
We can eat these,
too, right?

171
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,338
You can eat your fill
and then some.

172
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,589
Look.

173
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,470
Bet that's what
we were smelling.

174
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,097
Looks far enough away.

175
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,432
I wonder
how it started.

176
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,435
Maybe lightning.
Maybe a campfire.

177
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,104
I can patch that fence.

178
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,022
It's probably where
the deer are coming from.

179
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,859
We should leave it.
Just play it really safe in here.

180
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,778
( knocking )

181
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,575
If there's one in there,
it's not moving much.

182
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,829
Let's just stay close,
go slow room to room.

183
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,789
Girls, you sit tight.

184
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,000
You don't come in until we come out
no matter what you hear.

185
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,460
- Okay.
- Okay.

186
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,171
Lizzie's got Judith.
Mica, get out your gun.

187
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,382
You're gonna need
to stand watch.

188
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,344
Stand strong,
little lady.

189
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,774
They're gonna be okay.

190
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,860
It's not that.

191
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,033
Is it that
there was a baby?

192
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,827
No.

193
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,457
They're gonna find one in there
and they're going--

194
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,167
Stop it.
They aren't people.

195
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,336
But you're wrong.
All of you.

196
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,797
They aren't people, Lizzie.
They're just dead.

197
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,216
- ( snarling )
- ( girls gasp )

198
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,013
( Judith crying )

199
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,101
( gunshot )

200
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,521
( screaming )
Stop! Stop! Stop!

201
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,108
( Judith crying )

202
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,112
- Are you okay?
- ( hyperventilating )

203
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,574
All right, come on.
Come on.

204
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,243
Tyreese: Come on, come on.
I got you, little girl.

205
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,953
- Come on. Come here.
- Got her? Mica.

206
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,247
Mica, lower the gun.

207
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,417
You did it.
You saved them.

208
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,088
Why are you upset, Lizzie?
Were you scared?

209
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,257
No.

210
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,093
Then why
are you crying?

211
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,429
I don't want to say.

212
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,351
- I want to bury him.
- We can burn him.

213
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,770
This is probably
his house.

214
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,273
If we're gonna use it,
we should do the right thing.

215
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,943
He should be
with his family.

216
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,613
Fine, you can
bury him yourself.

217
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,157
No help from me,
no help from Tyreese.

218
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,788
I think you're
gonna help me.

219
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,458
( Judith crying )

220
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,462
Lizzie.

221
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,048
I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

222
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,010
Just look at the flowers
like you're supposed to.

223
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,428
Count one, two, three.

224
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,305
Come on,
let's count together.

225
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,140
Look at the pink ones
over there. You see?

226
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,768
Both:
One, two, three.

227
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,159
We got peaches,
oatmeal, baby food.

228
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,371
There's a crib,
baby clothes, toys.

229
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,666
And look.

230
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,502
Gas.
Can you believe this?

231
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,173
Everything always works out
like it's supposed to.

232
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,490
Take a break.

233
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,159
Thanks.

234
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,385
How are you gonna
get the body over here?

235
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,221
You're gonna help me.

236
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,936
( cracks )

237
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,488
You still upset?

238
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,409
Sometimes
I don't understand,

239
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,411
but I'm trying to, ma'am.

240
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,538
I am.

241
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,416
Look what I found.

242
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,503
I'm gonna name her
Griselda Gunderson.

243
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,467
Well, we got
plenty of water.

244
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,720
Now all we got to do is bag
one of them deer and we're all set.

245
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,306
- Then we'll get one.
- Yeah.

246
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,189
- What's wrong?
- I'm not used to this.

247
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,857
Used to what?

248
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,736
We're in a living room
in a house.

249
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,116
Yeah, so relax.

250
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,310
We should live here.

251
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,987
( pecans crack )

252
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,008
( Lizzie laughing )

253
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,886
Griselda.

254
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,597
- ( laughing )
- Lizzie.

255
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,640
Come on.

256
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,684
( snarling )

257
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,770
- You get away from it!
- No, no, no!

258
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,897
- Right now, Lizzie.
- No, no, no, no, no.

259
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,608
- No, no, no, no.
- Lizzie! Lizzie!

260
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,610
No! No!

261
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,490
She was playing with me.
She wanted a friend.

262
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,991
She wanted to kill you.

263
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,827
- I was gonna lead her away.
- You could have died.

264
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,662
It's the same thing!
You killed her!

265
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,665
- You killed her! It's the same thing!
- Lizzie.

266
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,043
What if I killed you?!
What if I killed you?!

267
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,463
Lizzie. Lizzie.

268
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,673
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

269
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,842
You don't understand.
You don't understand!

270
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,220
Lizzie. Lizzie.

271
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,514
( gasps )
You didn't have to.

272
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,599
You didn't have to.
She didn't want to hurt any...

273
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,810
( kettle whistling )

274
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,188
She didn't want
to hurt anybody!

275
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,607
She was my friend
and you killed her!

276
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,859
You killed her!

277
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,362
You killed her!

278
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,074
She was my friend.

279
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,785
( crying )

280
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,072
Carol:
Is it too heavy?

281
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,033
Nah, I'm good.

282
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,289
The fire's
still burning.

283
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,165
Carol:
It could have gone out.

284
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,459
Nope.
The smoke's black.

285
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,504
If it was white, the fire wouldn't
be burning anymore.

286
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,174
I miss science class.

287
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,468
Except for when
we had to do stuff like

288
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,471
cut up planaria worms.

289
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,516
You've got to do worse
than that nowadays, Mica.

290
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,477
- I don't gotta.
- You do.

291
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,314
Lizzie's bigger than you
and in some ways she's stronger.

292
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,774
But you're smarter

293
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,944
and you understand
these... things.

294
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,697
You've got to
look out for her.

295
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,449
You have to--

296
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,997
No, go ahead.
You do it.

297
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,458
Just like I showed you at the prison.
Go ahead.

298
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,566
I can't.

299
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,076
We have peaches.

300
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,049
You think
I'm too hard on them?

301
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,261
No. I get it.

302
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,809
One of them
can't kill walkers

303
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,603
and the other one
can't hurt a living thing.

304
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,315
They're both gonna have
to do both sooner or later.

305
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,072
I have to get them there
before we get to Terminus.

306
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,584
Maybe we don't need
to go to Terminus.

307
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,797
I've been thinking.

308
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,757
Mica's right.

309
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,051
We can stay here.

310
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,804
We can live here.

311
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,601
I know Lizzie and Mica.

312
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,105
I know Judith.

313
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,149
I know you.

314
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,401
I trust you.

315
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,029
And I don't know
if I can get that anywhere else.

316
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,824
We could stay.

317
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,618
We can live here.

318
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,754
Lizzie?

319
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,631
Lizzie?

320
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,973
( walker snarling )

321
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,517
( squeaking )

322
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,528
Don't worry.

323
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,322
I'll get you more.

324
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,115
Mica:
Lizzie.

325
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,578
When we were giving
them names,

326
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,997
we were just pretending
things weren't bad.

327
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,916
Things are bad.

328
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,002
Those things, they're bad.
They are.

329
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,588
We can't pretend anymore.

330
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,175
I'm not pretending.
You were.

331
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,678
I know.
I can hear them.

332
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,847
( growling )

333
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,602
They want to kill you.

334
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,355
They just want me
to change.

335
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,066
To make me be like them.

336
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,485
Maybe I should change.

337
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,362
( growling )

338
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,822
Stop it.

339
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,199
I can make you
all understand.

340
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,535
- Lizzie.
- ( leaves rustling )

341
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,870
( girls gasp )

342
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,500
Lizzie, they're coming.
Lizzie!

343
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,385
Carol!

344
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,810
( girls screaming )

345
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,896
( screaming )
Help!

346
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,566
Help, Carol!
Lizzie!

347
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,568
- Lizzie!
- Mica!

348
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,736
- Mica!
- Lizzie!

349
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,156
- Let me go! Help me!
- ( gunshot )

350
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,242
- ( Mica screams ) Help!
- Get behind us!

351
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,821
It's okay.

352
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,700
You did it.

353
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,805
I had to help stop them.

354
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,603
Do you understand
what they are now?

355
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,358
I know--

356
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,902
I know what I have
to do now.

357
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,779
I know.

358
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,200
It's ugly
and it's scary

359
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,577
and it does change you.

360
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,332
That's how
we get to be here.

361
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,377
That's the cost.
That's growing up now.

362
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,214
Mica:
I don't want to hurt anyone.

363
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,009
I don't want
to be mean.

364
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,012
You have to be sometimes.

365
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,265
But just sometimes.

366
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,187
No. No.

367
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,567
Now we have a lot
of pecans here.

368
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,319
A ton.

369
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,863
- You getting sick of them yet?
- Nope.

370
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,535
( laughs )

371
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,246
I used to make these
with my grandma when I was little.

372
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,415
They smell good.

373
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,668
There you go.
All right.

374
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,713
I think you guys are ready to start
doing the cooking around here.

375
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,840
Who wants to put 'em in?

376
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,384
Me.

377
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,223
The girls like it here.

378
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,809
We could build it up,
plant more food.

379
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,062
We could find a car
for an escape route just in case.

380
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,695
If you don't want to go to Terminus,
we could stay.

381
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,409
We could.

382
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,501
It doesn't mean
we can't go someday.

383
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,420
It's just...

384
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,882
when we were getting
closer and closer,

385
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,134
I realized

386
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,596
I'm just not ready to be
around other people yet.

387
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,765
You don't have to.

388
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,735
I dream about Karen.

389
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,073
I see her every night.

390
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,119
And every time
I forget she's dead.

391
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,626
Sometimes...

392
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,880
we just talk.

393
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,468
And sometimes

394
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,762
I see her in the crowd...

395
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,975
in a city
I've never been to.

396
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,397
And it's back before
everything happened.

397
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,113
And then...

398
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,951
some nights,
the bad ones...

399
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,247
I see someone kill her.

400
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,629
Some stranger.

401
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:24,178
Then I lose her
all over again.

402
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,855
But that's the deal, right?

403
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,691
The people who are living
are haunted by the dead.

404
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,362
We are who we are.

405
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,865
And we do what we do

406
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,451
'cause they're still here.

407
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,204
In our heads.

408
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,290
In the forest.

409
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,002
The whole world
is haunted now.

410
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,339
And there's no
getting out of that.

411
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,801
Not until we're dead.

412
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,347
Tyreese.

413
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,947
Maybe they're not
haunting us.

414
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:32,079
Maybe they're
just teaching us.

415
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,417
Helping remind us so--

416
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,756
so that we can live
with what we have to do.

417
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,391
Hey.

418
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,854
Don't you ever be ashamed
of who you are, Carol.

419
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,359
You did right
by those girls.

420
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:04,737
You did right
by everyone.

421
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,379
We'll get one yet.

422
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,881
Probably not even
deer season.

423
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,428
My husband
used to hunt.

424
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:33,266
He'd tell the same
stupid joke every year.

425
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,644
You gonna tell it?

426
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,980
Well, I guess
I have to now, right?

427
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,898
You do.

428
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,192
Okay.

429
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,321
What's the difference between
beer nuts and deer nuts?

430
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,660
Beer nuts
are around 1 .79,

431
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,870
deer nuts are just
under a buck.

432
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,165
( laughs )
That's good stupid,

433
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,585
but in no way
is it stupid good.

434
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,130
Yeah, I told you.
There's more where that came from.

435
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,477
Don't worry.
She'll come back.

436
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,396
I didn't hurt her brain.

437
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,173
No, no, no!
We have to wait.

438
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:48,716
I need to show you.
You'll see.

439
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,886
You'll finally get it.
We have to wait.

440
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,599
Lizzie,
put the gun down.

441
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,976
I just want us to wait.

442
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,228
We can wait.

443
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,357
We can wait.
You just give me the gun.

444
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,568
We can wait, I swear.

445
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,331
You and Tyreese
should take Judith back.

446
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,667
It's not safe for her.

447
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,086
But Judith can change, too.

448
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,339
- I was just about to--
- She can't even walk yet.

449
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,177
Yeah, you're right.

450
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,683
So you two take Judith
back to the house

451
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,185
and we'll have lunch.

452
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,146
And I'll just tie Mica up.

453
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,482
You know, just so
she won't go anywhere.

454
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,151
Promise that's
what you'll do?

455
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,278
Mm-hmm.

456
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,447
I promise.

457
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,200
I'll use
her shoelaces.

458
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,547
( Judith crying )

459
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,890
Let's--
let's go, Lizzie.

460
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,494
( crying )

461
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,393
I brought her
some food.

462
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,439
Cleared out her room.

463
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,650
Made sure she didn't
have any knives,

464
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,819
anything like that.

465
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,954
She has a shoe box
full of mice.

466
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,543
I asked her if she was the one
feeding the walkers at the prison.

467
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,214
That was her.

468
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,720
And at the tombs,

469
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,640
we found this rabbit

470
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:46,143
pulled apart and nailed
to a board.

471
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,814
That was her, too.

472
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,567
Said she was
just having fun.

473
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,116
I was thinking,

474
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,870
maybe she killed
Karen and David.

475
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:08,207
But I don't know how
she could drag them away.

476
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,419
She would have
let them turn.

477
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,588
It wasn't her.

478
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,180
So what do we do?

479
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,766
I could leave with her.

480
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,518
What?

481
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,022
We can't sleep with her and Judith
under the same roof.

482
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,943
You wouldn't make it.
Not on your own.

483
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,113
She can't be around
other people.

484
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:42,324
Maybe we could try
to help her.

485
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,702
Talk her back somehow.

486
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,204
This is how she is.

487
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,458
It was already there.

488
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,170
I didn't see it.

489
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,048
- How could you?
- I should have seen it.

490
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,472
So maybe we go.

491
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,391
Me and Judith.

492
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,560
You won't make it either.

493
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,776
She can't be around
other people.

494
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,887
You should pick
some wildflowers for Mica

495
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,473
to give her
when she comes back.

496
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,975
Yeah, she'd love that.

497
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,985
The fire's still burning.

498
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,237
No.

499
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,989
The smoke's white.

500
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,908
It's out.

501
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,787
You know
everything, ma'am.

502
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,456
No, I don't.

503
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,001
What is it?

504
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,713
What is it?

505
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,551
Are you mad at me?

506
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,721
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

507
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,102
I'm sorry I pointed
my gun at you.

508
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,729
I just needed you
to wait.

509
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,025
I know.

510
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,904
I'm sorry.

511
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,699
You're mad at me.

512
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,412
I love you, Lizzie.

513
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,707
( crying )

514
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,085
And everything works out
the way it's supposed to.

515
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,588
I'm sorry.

516
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,008
Please don't be
mad at me.

517
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:09,471
You just-- just look
at the flowers, Lizzie.

519
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,266
( crying )

520
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,313
Just look
at the flowers.

521
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,199
Just-- just look
at the flowers.

522
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,297
( gunshot )

523
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,156
I killed Karen
and David.

524
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,246
I had to stop the illness
from breaking out.

525
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,915
I had to stop
other people from dying.

526
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,590
It wasn't Lizzie.

527
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,552
It wasn't a stranger.

528
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,309
Tyreese, it was me.

529
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,277
You do what
you have to do.

530
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,962
Did she know
what was happening?

531
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,634
Was she scared?

532
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,021
It was quick?

533
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,359
Yes.

534
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,336
Do what you have to do.

535
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,859
I forgive you.

536
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,573
I'm never gonna forget.

537
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,536
It happened.

538
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:45,122
You did it.

539
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,749
You feel it.

540
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:50,210
I know you do.

541
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,547
It's a part of you now.

542
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,301
Me, too.

543
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:05,225
But I forgive you.

544
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,151
Thank you.

545
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,034
We don't need to stay.

546
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,248
We can't stay.

547
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,778
Lizzie's voice:
I'm not afraid to kill.

548
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,530
I'm just afraid.

549
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,242
Carol's voice:
You can't be.

550
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,495
Lizzie's voice:
How?

551
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,955
Carol's voice:
You fight...

552
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,124
and fight it.

553
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,127
You don't give up.

554
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,923
And then one day,

555
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:21,093
you just change.

556
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,682
We all change.

557
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,499
