1
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,958
( knock at door )

2
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,544
- Ma'am?
- Hi, Lizzie.

3
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,801
They told me to come down here.

4
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,803
Are you okay?

5
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,014
Good.

6
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,270
I wanted to see you
because I'm going on a run with Rick.

7
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,314
( faint sloshing )

8
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,608
Lizzie:
Do you think Daryl's dead?

9
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,943
Carol:
No.

10
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,778
He had to go far away
to get the medicine,

11
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,239
so it's gonna take a while.

12
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,245
We lost all our food in cell block D,

13
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,082
so we're gonna go look for more
and whatever else we can find.

14
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,131
Lizzie:
Nobody's died yet.

15
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,924
Yet?

16
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,801
I think a lot of people
are going to die.

17
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,471
It's what always happens.

18
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,973
Makes me sad, but...

19
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,558
at least they get to come back.

20
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,978
Lizzie, when they come back,
they aren't--

21
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,897
people aren't who they were.

22
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,649
Yeah, but they're something.

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,984
They're someone.

24
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,489
I'm little now.

25
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,492
If I don't die, I'll get big.

26
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,536
I'll be me, but I'll be different.

27
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,371
It's how it is.

28
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,216
( coughing )

29
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,012
( grunts )

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,806
Lizzie:
We all change.

31
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,642
We all don't get to stay
the same way we started.

32
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,519
Lizzie, it's more complicated--

33
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,355
You said I was weak.
I'm not.

34
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,358
I'm strong,
so I'm telling you what I think.

35
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,370
You remember what I told you to do
when there's danger?

36
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,121
Run as fast as I can.

37
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,874
You run and run until you're safe.

38
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,464
And if it's your life
or your sister's life,

39
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,550
you can't be afraid to kill.

40
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,385
Understand?

41
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,220
Yes.

42
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,559
Carol:
You are strong, Lizzie.

43
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,352
You're gonna live.

44
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,731
You, your sister,
and me--

45
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,484
we're gonna survive, I know it.

46
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,113
Where's your knife?

47
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,783
Put your T-shirt behind it.

48
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,827
You've gotta be able
to get to it quickly.

49
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,328
Yes, Mom.
I mean ma'am.

50
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,539
Don't call me "Mom."

51
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,834
It was an accident.

52
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,753
Just don't.

53
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,048
Okay.

54
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,553
Carol:
What is it?

55
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,181
Lizzie:
I'm not afraid to kill.

56
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,100
I'm just afraid.

57
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,811
You can't be.

58
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,939
How?

59
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,608
You fight it.

60
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,236
And fight it.

61
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,238
You don't give up.

62
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,284
And then one day,

63
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,954
you just change.

64
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,543
We all change.

65
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,975
( theme music playing )

66
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,393
Michonne:
This is Turner Creek,

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,853
so Barnesville must be
a few miles downstream.

68
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,564
Bob: Sounds like our best chance
at finding a new ride.

69
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,150
Daryl:
Yo, Ty.

70
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,697
Come on, let's go.
Vámonos.

71
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,957
Ty.

72
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,543
Ty!

73
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,005
There should be a town
a few miles south.

74
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,965
Lost a whole night.

75
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:48,055
My sister,
everybody else--

76
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,391
they're probably dead.

77
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,393
Well, it helps
to keep moving.

78
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,689
No, it doesn't.

79
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,091
Maggie wanted to come, you know.

80
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,928
Someone had to stay back,
watch over things.

81
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,265
Someone you trust,
you mean.

82
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,149
They would have drowned
in their own blood.

83
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,110
They were suffering.
I made it quick.

84
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,491
We needed the bodies gone.

85
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,951
We needed to stop it from spreading.

86
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,454
They were the only ones
who were sick.

87
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,789
They were a threat.

88
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,709
I was trying to save lives.

89
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,587
I had to try.
Somebody had to.

90
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,885
Maybe.

91
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,612
- Is that jasper?
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,115
It's a good color.
Brings out your eyes.

93
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,955
When Miss Richards went into A block,
we were leaving.

94
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,999
Asked me to keep a lookout.

95
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,502
I'm gonna use it
for her old man's marker.

96
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,797
You know all them back there?

97
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,675
You stay in one place
more than a couple hours,

98
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,802
you'd be surprised what you pick up.

99
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,601
( crows cawing )

100
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,881
Carol:
Think they're coming back?

101
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,134
Windshield's clean,
wiped down.

102
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,095
Can't have been here
more than a day, maybe two.

103
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,223
You mean Daryl and the others.
That's what this is, right?

104
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,975
In case they don't?

105
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,104
Until they do.
That's what this is.

106
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,773
Medicine cabinets,
first aid kits--

107
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,861
anything that could help Hershel.
We get in, we get out.

108
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,698
And if we can eat it, we take it.

109
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,286
( wood creaking )

110
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,391
You see something?

111
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,937
I don't know. Maybe.

112
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,074
( sighs )

113
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,371
We gotta find us a new battery.

114
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,919
- ( spits )
- ( walkers snarling )

115
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,089
Got some friends inside.

116
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,259
Come on.

117
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,471
Let's clear a path,
see how many we got.

118
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,479
( grunting )

119
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,526
Hey, man, go easy.
We don't know what we're dealing with.

120
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,947
- ( grunting )
- ( door rattling )

121
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,289
( door rattling )

122
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,042
( walker gasping )

123
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,802
( walker growls )

124
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,557
- ( growling )
- Ah!

125
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,911
Bob:
Tyreese!

126
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,748
Ty!

127
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,833
Ty, let him go.

128
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,588
( grunting )

129
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,022
Why the hell didn't you let go?

130
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,073
( door creaking )

131
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,790
( faint snarling )

132
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,959
( growling )

133
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:34,920
Carol!

134
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,477
( door opens )

135
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,316
( door creaks )

136
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,454
Whoa, whoa. It's cool.
We're-- we're cool.

137
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,414
We have fruit.

138
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,208
Man: Yeah, we got
apricots, peaches.

139
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,169
Here, catch.

140
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,550
Or, you know, don't.
( chuckles )

141
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,854
- Carol: How'd this happen?
- Greenhouse around the corner.

142
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,772
We were looking for a place to crash.

143
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,817
The roof's broken now and it's been
getting rain, so it's full of fruit.

144
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,487
We were there about a day
and the skin-eaters showed up.

145
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,280
( laughs )
Killjoys, man.

146
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,365
Jackin' it up
for the whole world.

147
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,327
I thought everybody was an asshole
before this all went down.

148
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,370
Now I love people.

149
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,207
You know-- people
who are alive.

150
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,541
How did it happen?

151
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,335
When they were coming in
through the door,

152
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,670
I tripped crawling out
the other side.

153
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,507
Pulled the glass out,
but my shoulder--

154
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,175
it still hurts like a bitch.

155
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,886
It's dislocated.

156
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,680
Can you fix it?

157
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,641
Here, lay on your back.

158
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,982
Okay, scooch over to the edge.

159
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,069
Just hold your arm...

160
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,363
Grab ahold of this bag.

161
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,740
- Hold on.
- ( groaning )

162
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,409
- And keep holding on.
- ( crying ) No, that hurts.

163
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,702
Keep holding.

164
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,329
I can't, I can't.

165
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,956
Keep holding.

166
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,791
- ( bone crackles )
- ( groaning )

167
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,461
( man gasping )

168
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,257
- ( bone pops )
- ( panting )

169
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,802
Sit up.

170
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,931
Woman:
Is it...

171
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,476
Yeah.

172
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,604
It's gonna be sore for a few days.

173
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,982
After the greenhouse,
you came here?

174
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,150
Yeah. We thought
it was clear.

175
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,862
We missed the deadie in the PJs,
so we dove into the bathroom.

176
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,115
So how long were you up there
till we showed up?

177
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,783
Like, two days.

178
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,119
There was just one.
You had guns.

179
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,954
We have about 12 bullets.

180
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,291
It usually take us about five or six
to bring one of them down.

181
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,792
But you have knives.

182
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,586
To what, stab it in the head?

183
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,129
Yeah.

184
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,590
We got separated from
our crew about a week ago.

185
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,301
Been trying to play it safe
since it's just the two of us.

186
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,469
- I have to with my leg.
- Yeah.

187
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,806
We were at a refugee center together
and there was a fire.

188
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,725
People were just
trampling over me.

189
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,226
Assholes.

190
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,186
Sam saved my life.

191
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,438
We didn't know each other before.

192
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,316
It didn't heal right,
but it healed.

193
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,276
And we found each other.

194
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,695
It was worth it.

195
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,488
Where are you two headed next?

196
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,823
We just keep moving.

197
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,201
We haven't been waiting
for places to go bad.

198
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,495
I mean, it's getting a little old.

199
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,040
You guys look all right.
What's your setup like?

200
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,208
The "skin-eaters"?

201
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,586
We call them walkers.

202
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,842
How many have you killed?

203
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,844
( door creaks )

204
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,898
Come on.

205
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,324
Here we go.

206
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,216
Hmm, cells look pretty dry.

207
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,385
A little distilled water
will clear that right up.

208
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,560
You should have let him go.

209
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,438
The hell you know about it, huh?

210
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,691
- You the damn expert?
- No.

211
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,193
I just don't want to see you die.

212
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,404
Is that what you're trying to do?

213
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,241
Do you even know
what you're trying to do?

214
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,786
I know you're pissed.

215
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,205
And you have every reason to be.

216
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,126
But anger makes you stupid.

217
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,088
Stupid gets you killed.

218
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,508
Aren't you still angry
about the Governor?

219
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,218
What he did?

220
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,512
If he was here right now,

221
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,473
I'd cut him in two.

222
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,851
'Cause that's how it needs to be.

223
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,771
But I'm not angry.

224
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,276
I was.

225
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,945
Then why are you still
going out looking for him?

226
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,998
I don't know.

227
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,628
( grunting )

228
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,803
Daryl:
That's puke.

229
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,016
Those douchebags in the vines

230
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,185
took themselves out,

231
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,728
holding hands--

232
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,439
kumbaya style.

233
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,524
They wanted to go out together
same as they lived.

234
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,109
That make them douchebags?

235
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,154
It does if they could have gotten out.

236
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:38,492
Everybody makes it,
till they don't.

237
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,786
People nowadays
are dominoes.

238
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,039
What they did, maybe it's about not
having to watch them fall.

239
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,833
Right.

240
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,630
( raspy breathing )

241
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,131
Come on.

242
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,292
( grunts )

243
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,885
We got about all
we're gonna get here.

244
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,554
We should move on.

245
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,973
So, did we pass your test?

246
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,898
We're in a prison eight miles north.

247
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,527
If you come back with us,
we can't guarantee your safety.

248
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,946
There's an illness, a flu.

249
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,073
It's bad.

250
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,575
We've lost a lot.

251
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,618
- Kids, too.
- Yours?

252
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,413
No, thank God.

253
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,541
But one of my girls, she's got it.

254
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,836
- I'm sorry.
- She's strong. She'll make it.

255
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,922
Sam:
You got fences and walls?

256
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,592
- We're in.
- Yeah, whatever you need us to do.

257
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,886
For now, sit tight.

258
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,388
The two of us will circle back for you
before dark.

259
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,765
Or you could help us sweep
the rest of this neighborhood.

260
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,809
Woman: We can do that.
I can check the greenhouse,

261
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,311
see if it's clear,
bring back more fruit.

262
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,812
And I can hit
some of the houses.

263
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,439
Well, it's nice
of you to offer,

264
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,357
but your shoulder's
barely--

265
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,902
Sam: As long as I don't put too much
weight on this arm, I'm good.

266
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,445
Woman: And I can
still move pretty fast.

267
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,615
- I just don't think--
- We won't take any chances.

268
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,492
We'll look.
And if it's cake, we'll do it.

269
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,579
If not,
we'll just roll.

270
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,498
I mean, you don't look
so good yourself, man.

271
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,167
Are you a righty
or a lefty?

272
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,339
We'll cover more ground.
The sooner we get back...

273
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,840
Sam:
You can't carry us, man.

274
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:02,969
- It doesn't work that way.
- Please, we want to help.

275
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,523
You fire a shot,
we'll come running.

276
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,318
Let's meet back here in two hours.

277
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,284
You'll need this.

278
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,625
You never told us about the group
you were with before.

279
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,045
Which one?

280
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,761
You know, when you found me
out on that road,

281
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,680
I almost kept walking.

282
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,307
Why is that?

283
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,351
'Cause I was done
being a witness.

284
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,021
Two times,
two different groups.

285
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,233
I was the last one standing.

286
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,529
Like I was supposed
to see it happen over and over,

287
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,739
like it's some kind of curse.

288
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:13,081
But, when it's just you
out there with the quiet...

289
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,043
Used to be I'd drink
a bottle of anything

290
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,920
just so I could shut my eyes at night.

291
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:23,049
Figured the prison, the people,
thought it'd be easier.

292
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:27,470
The run to the Big Spot,
I did it for me.

293
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,222
You gotta keep busy.

294
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,183
No. I did it so I could get me
a bottle.

295
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,395
Of anything.

296
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,273
I picked it up,
I held it in my hand,

297
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,150
but I put it down.

298
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,069
I put it down so hard
it took the whole damn shelf with it.

299
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,071
That's what brought on the walkers,

300
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,532
and that's what got Zack killed.

301
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,913
That's bullshit.

302
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,712
Why don't you get in there
and try the engine?

303
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,839
It's a red and a green wire.

304
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,758
Go on. It ain't rocket science.

305
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,559
Give it some gas.

306
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,442
( engine starting )

307
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,613
( whistles )

308
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,573
( car door closes )

309
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,622
Sasha and me picked that spot.

310
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,999
He took you with us.

311
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,668
There ain't no way
anybody could've known.

312
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,296
You ain't gonna be standing alone,

313
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,174
not no more. Let's go.

314
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,392
( engine revving )

315
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,651
It's all expired
by at least a year.

316
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:08,404
Better to take it.
Let Hershel decide what he needs.

317
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,743
Did you think it was right?

318
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,329
Letting those kids
come back with us?

319
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,499
I think it was
the humane thing to do.

320
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,668
But did you think it was right?

321
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,505
( drawer slides )

322
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,715
Look at us.

323
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,050
Digging through drawers,

324
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,845
hoping that...
a couple of cough drops

325
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,972
and some disinfectant
might be the difference

326
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,683
between dying and living
a couple of more hours.

327
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,351
( pills rattling )

328
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,353
If they're strong enough
to help us survive this thing,

329
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,730
yeah, I think you made
the right call.

330
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,065
Rick:
And if they're not?

331
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,526
Let's hope they are.

332
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,863
( softly )
Yeah.

333
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,784
Rick...

334
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:01,541
I killed two people
and you haven't said a word about it.

335
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,919
What do you want me to say?

336
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,214
It's not about what you say.
It's about facing reality.

337
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,092
It always comes for us
and over and over again

338
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,552
we face it so that we can live.

339
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,804
- So that we can live.
- That's right.

340
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,223
That's what it always
comes down to.

341
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,892
You can be a farmer, Rick.

342
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,895
You can't just be a farmer.

343
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,655
You're a good leader.

344
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:36,075
Better than I probably
gave you credit for.

345
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,329
I never murdered two of our own.

346
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,706
Just one.

347
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,669
He was gonna kill me.

348
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,880
So were they.

349
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,423
They were gonna kill all of us.

350
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,759
You don't know that.

351
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,431
If you thought it would
save Judith or Carl,

352
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,892
would you have done it then or would you
have just gone back to your crops

353
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,312
and hoped it'd all be okay?

354
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,940
You don't have to like what I did, Rick.

355
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,777
I don't.
You just accept it.

356
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,701
( wind rustling )

357
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,537
( distant can rattles )

358
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,791
Daryl:
Looks like we're getting closer.

359
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,335
Tyreese:
The building we want is just up ahead.

360
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,631
( creaking )

361
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,137
( softly )
Come on. Come on.

362
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,098
Move, move.

363
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,893
All right, let's make this quick

364
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,313
There you go.

365
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,659
Come on.

366
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,636
Carol:
Let's hit the houses across the street.

367
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,680
Hold on.

368
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,645
How'd you put his
shoulder back before?

369
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,188
You learn that from Hershel?

370
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,025
Internet.

371
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,985
It was easier than telling an ER nurse

372
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,196
I'd fallen down the stairs a third time.

373
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,115
I'm sorry.

374
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,702
Don't be. Just fixed
what needed fixin'.

375
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:49,208
I actually convinced myself
I was happy with him.

376
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,585
Which wasn't all that hard to do,

377
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:54,380
considering my idea of happiness then
was just not being alone.

378
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,592
Made a decent living.

379
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,552
He was charming
when he wanted to be,

380
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,891
especially those mornings
after he'd come home piss-drunk and...

381
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:12,565
Stupid. Stupid.

382
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,903
I didn't think I could be strong.

383
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:19,739
I didn't know I could.

384
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,575
I already was.

385
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:27,955
Why don't you say her name?

386
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,627
She's dead, Rick.

387
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:36,005
Sophia. Dead.

388
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,885
Somebody else's slideshow.

389
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,771
Some mornings I still wake up
half-expecting Lori to be there.

390
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,275
Reminding me to pick up Carl
after school

391
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,779
or telling me breakfast is ready.

392
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,659
Every Sunday she'd make us
these pancakes

393
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:08,538
that were just... godawful.

394
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,956
( chuckling )

395
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,543
Clumps of flour
that weren't mixed in right.

396
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,795
Thing was...

397
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:19,048
she knew it was bad.

398
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,259
Why'd she keep at it?

399
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,470
Well...

400
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:28,933
she wanted us to be the kind of family
that ate pancakes on Sunday.

401
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,631
( creaks )

402
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,099
( grunting, munching )

403
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,187
We should get back.

404
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,898
Sam's probably waiting.

405
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,743
Anything ending with -cillin or -cin,

406
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,786
C-I-N, grab it.

407
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:35,041
We'll dissolve the pills in the IVs,
put 'em right into the bloodstream.

408
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:38,794
Dosage will be tricky
but considering the time we lost...

409
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,176
- How'd you do?
- Bags, tubes, clamps, connectors.

410
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,220
- Everything on the list.
- What about y'all?

411
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,555
Yeah, we got it all.

412
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,433
Yeah. We're good.

413
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,227
All right, let's roll.

414
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,705
( softly )
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

415
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,418
( snarling )

416
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,632
Michonne:
Up ahead.

417
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,885
( growling, snarling )

418
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,605
( door creaks, shuts )

419
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,150
Hey! Door's busted.

420
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,361
Oh. Hold up.

421
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,323
( walkers growling )

422
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,328
( snarling )

423
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,792
Michonne:
There.

424
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,724
( snarling )

425
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,310
( grunting )

426
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,818
( snarling )

427
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,403
- How many?
- I can't tell.

428
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:28,571
( rumbling )

429
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,659
- Tyreese: We can take 'em.
- Bob: No! They're infected.

430
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:34,910
Same as at the prison.

431
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,830
We fire at 'em, get their blood
on us, breathe it in.

432
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,415
We didn't come all
this way to get sick.

433
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,334
How do we know the ones in there
aren't any different?

434
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,837
- We don't.
- Well, it's gotta change sometime.

435
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,552
( snarling )

436
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,180
- ( blade rings )
- Daryl: Ready?

437
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,848
Tyreese:
Do it!

438
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,017
( growling, snarling )

439
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,352
( grunts )

440
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,562
( snarling )

441
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,027
Daryl:
Come on.

442
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,864
( snarling )

443
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,541
( tapping )

444
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,718
It's been too long.

445
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,971
We should give him a couple more.

446
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,186
He might be fine.

447
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,314
He really might be.

448
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,153
But it doesn't matter...

449
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,449
because he's not here...
and we have to go.

450
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,421
It was a nice watch.

451
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,931
( snarling, growling )

452
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,766
( snarls )

453
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,733
- ( doorknob rattles )
- Back.

454
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,317
Don't have an exit.

455
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,902
Then we make one.

456
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,198
Get down!
( grunts )

457
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,620
- Come on, move it!
- Jump down to the walkway below.

458
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,331
- Bob: They're here!
- Let's go! Go, go. Move.

459
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,967
( snarling )

460
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:06,103
Michonne:
Bob, let it go.

461
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,563
Let it go, man.

462
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,232
- ( grunting )
- Tyreese: Just let it go.

463
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,027
- ( snarling, growling )
- Daryl: Let go of the bag, man.

464
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,909
( snarling, growling )

465
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,376
You got no meds in your bag?

466
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,295
Just this?

467
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,343
You should have kept
walking that day.

468
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,762
Don't.

469
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,153
( grunting )

470
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,615
Just let it go, Daryl.

471
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,617
The man's made his choice.

472
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,494
Nothing you can do about it.

473
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,497
Just gotta let it go.

474
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,583
I didn't want to hurt nobody.

475
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,380
It was just for when it gets quiet.

476
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,135
Take one sip.

477
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,347
When those meds get in our people,

478
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,892
I will beat your ass into the ground.

479
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,894
You hear me?

480
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,590
( handle clicking )

481
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,260
They might have lived.

482
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:07,474
Karen and David,
they might have lived,

483
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,935
and now they're dead.

484
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:13,230
That wasn't your decision to make.

485
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,775
When Tyreese finds out...

486
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,987
...he'll kill you.

487
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,698
He damn near killed me over nothing.

488
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,283
I can handle Tyreese.

489
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:25,993
When the others find out,

490
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,454
they won't want you there.

491
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:31,165
And if they don't make it back,

492
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,709
if everybody dies of this thing

493
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,128
and it's just the two of us,

494
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:41,008
with Judith and Carl--
with my children...

495
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,598
I won't have you there.

496
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,892
Rick, it's me.

497
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,395
No one else has to know.

498
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:56,106
I thought you were done making decisions
for everyone.

499
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,735
I'm making this decision for me.

500
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:04,156
I could have pretended
that everything was gonna be fine.

501
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,118
But I didn't.

502
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,624
I did something.
I stepped up.

503
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,917
I had to do something.

504
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:18,337
No, you didn't.

505
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,722
If you think I'm going anywhere
without Lizzie and Mica--

506
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,309
If you want them to leave,
to go out there with you?

507
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:36,271
Lizzie's sick.
Mica is 10 years old.

508
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,774
She can't.
( sniffles )

509
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,360
We'll keep them safe.

510
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,703
You're not that woman who was too scared
to be alone, not anymore.

511
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,580
You're gonna start over,
find others,

512
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,708
people who don't know,

513
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,044
and you're gonna survive out here.

514
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,839
You will.

515
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,385
Maybe.

516
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,812
Tyreese: That's where
I was traveling, Highway 100.

517
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,024
Michonne: Then it will take about
seven hours to get there.

518
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,817
We're gonna need
more gas.

519
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,861
Tyreese:
But we'll get there.

520
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,657
- Taking Highway 100.
- I heard.

521
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,373
( door closes )

522
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:44,381
You were right,
what you said before.

523
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,925
About the trail going cold.

524
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,764
I don't need to go out anymore.

525
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,601
Good.

526
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,481
( engine starts )

527
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,578
Take it.

528
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,301
Ed gave this to me
on our first anniversary.

529
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,557
Please.

530
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,775
I should have given it away
a long time ago.

531
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,699
