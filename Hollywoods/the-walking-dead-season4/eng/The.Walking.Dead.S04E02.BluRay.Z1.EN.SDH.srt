1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,838
( crickets chirping )

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,264
( faint snarling )

3
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,061
( snarling )

4
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,274
( squeaking )

5
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,535
( crunching, squealing )

6
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,466
What are you thinking about?

7
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,301
Yesterday.

8
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,596
Zack. I can't stop.

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,059
Yeah, me neither.

10
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,604
It used to be we all
had acquaintances.

11
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,065
Just people moving
in and out of your life.

12
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,109
No big.

13
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,404
See them down
the road sometime.

14
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,865
Now...

15
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,659
a handful of people
you know,

16
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,870
and that's it.

17
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,540
They might as well be the only people
left in the world.

18
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,543
Am I talking too much?

19
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,086
A little, but I like it.

20
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,505
( laughs )

21
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:37,597
♪ I got you ♪

22
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,683
- ♪ Under my skin... ♪
- Mmm...

23
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,104

24
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,565
♪ Deep in
the heart of me... ♪

25
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,984
Okay, now you're just
embarrassing me.

26
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,112
♪ So deep in my heart ♪

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,908
♪ That you are really
a part of me. ♪

28
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,662
I got you.

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,666
We should probably try
to get some rest.

30
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,962
Yeah.

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,298
Hey, come crash at my place.

32
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,509
( laughs )

33
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,887
Okay, I'll crash
at your place, then.

34
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,807
You know we start doing that,
we're not gonna want to stop.

35
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,061
Not just yet.

36
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,480
Yeah.

37
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,620
Good night.

38
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,337
( tapping )

39
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,483
( splashing )

40
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,611
( distant rattling )

41
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,760
( faint dripping )

42
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,576
( snarling )

43
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,018
( snarling softly )

44
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,575
( snarling softly )

45
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,420
( man coughing )

46
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,842
( snoring within )

47
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,726
( gurgling )

48
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,196
( snarling softly )

49
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,371
( theme music playing )

50
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,826
( squishing )

51
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,541
( faint ticking )

52
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,877
( bell ringing )

53
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,215
( ringing )

54
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,842
( stops )

55
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,555
Carl?

56
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,474
Carl.

57
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,726
Come on.

58
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,110
( man coughing )

59
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,615
( snarling )

60
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,245
( moaning )

61
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,458
( snarling )

62
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,720
( splatters )

63
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,514
( growls )

64
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,598
( camera clicks )

65
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,809
( flash whines,
camera whirring )

66
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,228
( laughs )
Sorry.

67
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,358
Changing of the guard?

68
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,114
Yeah.

69
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,284
I'll bring you breakfast
after perimeter check.

70
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,498
Oh, my God.
Throw that away.

71
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,168
Yeah.

72
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,669
Not gonna happen.

73
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,671
It's mine.

74
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,101
( hatch creaks )

75
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,867
Rick:
Careful out there.

76
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,786
Michonne:
Always am. Any requests?

77
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,290
Books? Comics?
Some stale M&Ms?

78
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,250
You're the one that likes stale M&Ms.

79
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,835
Then I'll definitely looking for some.

80
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,379
I'll look for some stuff you like, too.

81
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,716
Why don't you wear your hat anymore?

82
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,511
It's not a farming hat.
See you soon?

83
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,056
Pretty soon.

84
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,559
( walkers growling )

85
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,949
( fence creaking )

86
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,411
They only took out
one cluster yesterday.

87
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,332
Probably gonna need
more people today.

88
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,501
Maybe we could help.

89
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,256
I got other plans
involving dirt and cucumbers

90
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,924
and keeping people fed.

91
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,094
Well, if you don't want to,
maybe I could.

92
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,933
Could I?

93
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,560
We have other plans.

94
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,938
That's what I should have said.

95
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,900
( pigs grunting )

96
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,569
Come on in.
There we go.

97
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,577
Dad...?

98
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,413
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,248
I've been trying.

100
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,501
Yeah, I know.
And I'm proud.

101
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,922
Dad,

102
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,049
when can I have
my gun back?

103
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,185
Worms will give them
some extra protein.

104
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,022
( distant gunfire
echoes )

105
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,816
Stay close.

106
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,902
Help! Help!
Please, come quick!

107
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,572
- Cell block?
- I don't know.

108
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,033
Get in the tower with Maggie.
Don't argue, go.

109
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,581
- Walkers in D!
- What about C?

110
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,166
Clear. We locked the gates
to the tombs.

111
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,001
- Hershel's on guard.
- It ain't a breach.

112
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,086
Sasha:
We followed the plan.

113
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,006
( whistles )

114
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,680
( creaks )

115
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,058
( snarling )

116
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,354
Whoa, boy.

117
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,116
Maggie:
Hold on!

118
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,498
( grunts )

119
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,510
( groans )

120
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,348
Come here.

121
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,186
( groans )

122
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,899
( all snarling )

123
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,697
( people screaming )

124
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,282
- Move!
- Daryl!

125
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,243
I got it.
Are you bit?

126
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,245
Go. Get out of here.

127
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,580
Hold that.
Go, go.

128
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,250
Are you bit?
All right, go.

129
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,295
Get up.
Get back in the cell.

130
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,007
Here.

131
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,885
( Carol yelling )

132
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,597
Come with me.
Stay in there.

133
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,099
Wait, wait,
wait, wait!

134
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,392
( sobbing )

135
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,686
Got you.
Go!

136
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,104
( groaning )

137
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,568
Karen! Karen!

138
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,944
- Are you okay?
- You all right?

139
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,615
- Just stay calm.
- ( groaning )

140
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,203
I'm gonna have to
amputate your arm

141
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,998
to stop the infection
from spreading.

142
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,250
- ( snarling )
- Rick: Check all of 'em-- every cell.

143
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,210
I have to do it now.

144
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,463
I want you to bite this.

145
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,805
- Are we clear down here?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,515
- We're safe?
- Yeah, yeah.

147
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,267
Man:
Up here!

148
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,227
- ( sobbing )
- It's okay.

149
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,236
( growling )

150
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,988
Get down!

151
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,496
Thanks.

152
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,210
Oh, it's Patrick.

153
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,675
Daryl:
That's all of 'em.

154
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,606
I got it.

155
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,084
( sobbing )

156
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,260
( panting )
Whew...

157
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,512
It's happening, isn't it?

158
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,139
You're in shock, okay?

159
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,683
I want you just to lay back.

160
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,441
Lizzie and Mica,

161
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,776
you care about them.

162
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,653
I've seen it.

163
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,157
I don't have anybody else.

164
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,618
Kids on their own,

165
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,287
they don't have a chance.

166
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,541
Can you look out for them?

167
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,752
Like they're yours?

168
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,880
Yeah.

169
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,550
Yeah, I can. I will.

170
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,642
( moans )

171
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,020
Ryan.

172
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,606
You're gonna have to
let them say goodbye.

173
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,608
Okay?

174
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,445
Okay.

175
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,368
( snarling )

176
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,835
( body thumps )

177
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,174
( door opens )

178
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,598
No bites. No wounds.

179
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,517
I think he just died.

180
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,853
Horribly, too.
Pleurisy aspiration.

181
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,356
Choked to death
on his own blood.

182
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,359
Caused those trails down his face.

183
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,279
I've seen them before
on a walker outside the fences.

184
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,365
I saw them on Patrick, too.

185
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,742
They're from the internal
lung pressure building up--

186
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,786
like if you shake
a soda can and pop the top.

187
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,580
Only imagine your eyes,

188
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,125
ears, nose, and throat
are the top.

189
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,378
It's a sickness
from the walkers?

190
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,213
No, these things happened
before they were around.

191
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,798
Could be pneumococcal.

192
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,383
Most likely an aggressive
flu strain.

193
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,677
Someone locked him in
just in time.

194
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,680
No, man.
Charlie used to sleepwalk.

195
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,183
Locked himself in. Hell,
he was just eating barbecue yesterday.

196
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,061
How could somebody die
in a day just from a cold?

197
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,313
I had a sick pig,
it died quick.

198
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,233
Saw a sick boar
in the woods.

199
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:53,238
Pigs and birds. That's how these things
spread in the past.

200
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,198
We need to do something
about those hogs.

201
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,994
Maybe we got lucky.
Maybe these two cases are it.

202
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,288
Haven't seen anybody
be lucky in a long time.

203
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,499
Bugs like to run
through close quarters.

204
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,710
Doesn't get any closer
than this.

205
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:10,881
Hershel: All of us in here,
we've all been exposed.

206
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,525
Mica:
Dad?

207
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,403
We have to go get Dr. S.

208
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:37,491
Honey, he's been bit.
The doctor won't help.

209
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,960
You take care of your sister.

210
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,219
Dad.

211
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,805
Dad?

212
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,351
- Dad?
- No.

213
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,478
- Come on, it's time.
- No.

214
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,230
You know what I have to do.

215
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,315
What we're always supposed to do.

216
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,400
You can wait outside
if you want.

217
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,694
Okay?

218
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,034
We should be the ones.

219
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,832
No. I can't.

220
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,293
Lizzie, are you sure?

221
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,170
You taught us.

222
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,422
- I can do it.
- Okay, well, you have to do it now.

223
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,842
You need to do it right now because
you have to do it before he turns.

224
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,844
I'm gonna stay right here.

225
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,680
You remember
what I showed you?

226
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,857
- ( gasping )
- ( knife clatters )

227
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,526
Lizzie. Lizzie, Lizzie.
It's okay.

228
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,361
It's okay.

229
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,988
Lizzie? Lizzie,
it's okay. Breathe.

230
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,615
Look at the flowers.
Count one, two, three with me.

231
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,285
- One, two--
- Daddy, no!

232
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,619
Mica:
No, Lizzie, look at the flowers.

233
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,371
Count one, two,
three with me.

234
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,915
- One, two, three.
- Look at the flowers, Lizzie.

235
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,334
- No!
- Look at the flowers!

236
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,879
( sobbing )

237
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,231
Hey, you might
want to stay back.

238
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,610
- Carl.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

239
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,695
I didn't see you come out.

240
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,907
It's okay. I'm here.
I'm fine. But back away.

241
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,326
I had to use one
of the guns by the gate.

242
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,994
I swear
I didn't want to.

243
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,955
I was coming back.
I fell.

244
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,415
They came out
and helped me.

245
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,834
Are you all right?

246
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,086
What happened in there?

247
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,432
Patrick got sick last night.

248
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,768
It's some kind of flu.
It moves fast.

249
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,103
We think he died
and attacked the cell block.

250
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,231
Look, I know he was your friend
and I'm sorry.

251
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,567
He was a good kid.

252
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,444
We lost a lot of good people.

253
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:25,742
Glenn and your dad are okay,
but they were in there.

254
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,328
You shouldn't get too close to anyone
that might have been exposed,

255
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,539
at least for a little while.

256
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,709
Carl. All of you.

257
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,839
Patrick was fine yesterday,

258
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,967
and he died overnight.

259
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,260
Two people died that quick?

260
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,848
We'll have to separate
everyone that's been exposed.

261
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,892
That's everyone in that cell block.

262
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,062
That's all of us.
Maybe more.

263
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,900
We know that this sickness
can be lethal.

264
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,988
We don't know how easily
it spreads.

265
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,074
Is anyone else showing symptoms
that we know of?

266
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,827
We can't just wait and see.
There's children.

267
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,704
It isn't just the illness.

268
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,831
If people die,
they become a threat.

269
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,168
We need a place for them to go.

270
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,837
They can't stay in D.

271
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,339
We can't risk going in
there to clean it up.

272
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,966
We can use cell block A.

273
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,884
Death row?

274
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,012
I'm not sure
that's much of an upgrade.

275
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,639
Daryl: It's clean.
That's an upgrade.

276
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,808
Think that'll work
for Dr. S?

277
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,935
I'll help Caleb get it set up.

278
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,188
( woman coughing )

279
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,526
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

280
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,364
You sure?
You don't sound so good.

281
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,908
We're just taking her back
to my cell so she can rest.

282
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,870
Tyreese, I don't think
that's a good idea.

283
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,539
Why?
What's going on now?

284
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,543
We think it's a flu
or something.

285
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,587
That's how Patrick died.

286
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,130
Judith was in that cell block.

287
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,382
She's vulnerable.

288
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,717
Anyone that may be sick

289
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,303
or even exposed should stay away.

290
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:09,554
It killed Patrick?

291
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,598
Tyreese: She's gonna be okay.

292
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:15,351
Now that we know what Patrick died from
we can treat it, right?

293
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,520
Don't panic.
We're going to figure this out.

294
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,356
But we should keep you
separated in the meantime.

295
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,567
We'll have Caleb
take a look at you.

296
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,361
I'll see what we have
in the way of medications.

297
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,866
David from the Decatur group,
he's been coughing, too.

298
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,035
Glenn:
I'll get him.

299
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,829
There's some empty clean
cells in the tombs, right?

300
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,331
- Yeah, we'll meet you there.
- Okay.

301
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,043
Come on.

302
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,504
Let's get you settled.

303
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,927
Have to call another meeting later.

304
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,678
All right.

305
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,889
I'll get to burying
the dead ones.

306
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,766
You wear gloves
and a mask.

307
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,143
Uh-huh.

308
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,774
You all right?

309
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,527
I'm worried about Lizzie and Mica.
They were around Patrick.

310
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,779
We all were.

311
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,282
Karen and David are gonna be separated
till they feel better.

312
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,952
You're right.
Are you okay?

313
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,415
Mm-hmm. Got to be.

314
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,801
( snarling )

315
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,304
Gonna bury your dad.

316
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,642
You can visit,
bring him flowers.

317
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,981
Lizzie, we're gonna have to talk
about what happened in there.

318
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:55,493
Your daddy asked me to protect you
like you're my own and I will.

319
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,622
It's time someone
told you the truth.

320
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,043
Honey, you're weak.

321
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,671
- ( sniffles )
- You lost your nerve.

322
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,674
You have to trust your gut and you have
to act fast every time.

323
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,843
That's life and death.

324
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,181
He's dead.

325
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,516
I know, and I'm sorry.

326
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,897
But if you want to live,
you have to become strong.

327
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,940
He's dead.
He's dead.

328
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,401
He was special
and now he's dead.

329
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,655
Why'd they kill him?
Why'd they kill Nick?

330
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,158
You're so stupid.

331
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,078
Nick?

332
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,416
She's messed up.

333
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,919
She's not weak.

334
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,189
Glad you were in there.

335
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,024
Wasn't much use
without my gun.

336
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,735
No, you were.

337
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,239
All this time
you've been taking off,

338
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,574
you earned it.

339
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,243
We wouldn't be here
without you.

340
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,745
It was all of us.

341
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:24,082
No, it was you first.

342
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,709
You gonna help us
figure this out?

343
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:31,172
I screwed up
too many times.

344
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,467
Those calls you got to make,
I start down that road...

345
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,929
I almost lost my boy--
who he was.

346
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,934
Whatever else this place needs,
I'm here for it.

347
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,602
Like I said,
you earned it.

348
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,230
But for what it's worth,
you see mistakes.

349
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,941
I see when the shit hits,

350
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,859
you're standing there
with a shovel.

351
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,864
Rick! Daryl!

352
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,118
Oh, shit.

353
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,747
( growling )

354
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,300
The noise drew 'em out
and now this part's starting to give.

355
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,855
( snarling )

356
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,743
( rattling )

357
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,044
( grunts )

358
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,058
Did you see anything?

359
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,810
They just started
taking out the dead.

360
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:11,314
I don't need to know who yet.

361
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,732
I don't want to.

362
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,276
I'm glad you came back safe.

363
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,695
It was stupid.

364
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,073
I was so stupid.

365
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,035
When I fell on my ass,
they should have just left me out there.

366
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,204
Now that's stupid.

367
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,707
We care about you.

368
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,542
They could have gotten hurt.

369
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,503
When you care about people

370
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,214
hurt is kind of part of the package.

371
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,891
Were there any kids?

372
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,018
( Judith fussing )

373
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,771
Got all these widows
and orphans,

374
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:55,733
but what do you call
someone who lost a child?

375
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,070
You'd think someone would
have given that a name.

376
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,573
( Judith crying )

377
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,747
Are you okay?

378
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,457
Does she always cry like that?

379
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,127
I think she senses people's moods.

380
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,421
( crying continues )

381
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,634
( snarling )

382
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,392
( yelps )

383
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,148
Don't.

384
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,942
We're supposed to stay
away from each other.

385
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,195
Are you seeing this?

386
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,118
Is someone feeding these things?

387
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,457
- Heads up.
- This part of the fence, now!

388
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,251
( creaking )

389
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,295
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, hey, hey.

390
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,548
It's gonna give!
It's gonna give!

391
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,979
( screams )

392
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,648
Everybody back!
Come on, back, now.

393
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,363
Fence keeps bending in like that,
those walkers are coming over it.

394
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,081
Daryl, get the truck.

395
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,792
I know what to do.

396
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,227
You know if Patrick was Catholic?

397
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,272
He said he was a practicing atheist.

398
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,574
Did you tell your dad what you saw
in the library yesterday?

399
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,911
Nope.

400
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:15,039
Are you going to tell him?

401
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,838
I have to keep teaching
those kids to survive.

402
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,466
You know that.

403
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,469
Did you tell their parents?

404
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,555
No.

405
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,516
Are you gonna tell them?

406
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,686
If I do, maybe after this
they'll understand.

407
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,438
But maybe they won't.
I don't want to take that risk.

408
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,983
That's between you and them.

409
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,492
No.

410
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,869
It's between you and me.

411
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,665
If you tell your dad,
he'll tell them.

412
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,085
And like I said, maybe
they'll understand, maybe they won't.

413
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,671
I don't want to lie to my dad.

414
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,425
I'm not asking you to lie.

415
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,763
I'm asking you not to say anything.

416
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,727

Some lullaby.

I just sing her what I like.

430
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,929
( Judith moaning )

431
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,642
Figure it's better than ashes
or cradles falling out of trees.

432
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,686
( crying, sputters )

433
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:04,190
Oh, shoot.
Can you hold her a second?

434
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,275
- Please, I'm covered in carrots.
- No.

435
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,819
( Judith crying )

436
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,786
Thanks.

437
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,081
( crying )

438
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,664
- ( grunts )
- ( gate creaks )

439
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,510
( walkers snarling )

440
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,811
Ready?

441
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,321
( snarling )

442
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,293
Let's go.

443
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,799
( squealing )

444
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,476
( squealing )

445
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,102
Go!

446
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,326
All right!
Hold up!

447
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,460
( squealing )

448
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,298
( squealing )

449
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,884
All right, go.
Go.

450
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,981
( squealing )

451
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,853
( growling )

452
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,862
Lizzie, those are walkers.

453
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,115
Nick was a walker.

454
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,784
You don't feel bad
about that walker dying.

455
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,495
You feel bad about your dad.

456
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,333
You loved him
and he's gone.

457
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,672
Yeah.

458
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,133
( snarling )

459
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,066
There.

460
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,468
( clatters )

461
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,099
Not this time.

462
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,480
( clatters )

463
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,941
Think the pigs made them sick?

464
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,777
Or we made the pigs sick.

465
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,320
( clatters )

466
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:04,281
I think we should stay
away from Judy a while.

467
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,492
- Just in case.
- Okay.

468
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,995
- I don't like it, but--
- We have to protect her.

469
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,124
Yes, we do.

470
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,128
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

471
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,674
Carol's been teaching the kids...

472
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,802
( sighs )
how to use weapons.

473
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,680
How to kill.

474
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,140
Their parents don't know

475
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,935
and she doesn't want you to know.

476
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,481
I think you should let her.

477
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,234
I know you're gonna say
it's not up to you.

478
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:41,986
But it can be.

479
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,917
Dad?

480
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,877
Thank you for telling me.

481
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,881
Yeah.

482
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,643
I won't stop her.

483
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,062
I won't say anything.

484
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,783
( crackling )

485
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,422
Carl?

486
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,669
( growling )

487
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,250
( theme music playing )
