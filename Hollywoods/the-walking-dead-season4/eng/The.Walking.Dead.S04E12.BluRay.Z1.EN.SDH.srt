1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,379
( insects chirping )

2
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,105
( thunder rumbling )

3
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,032
( leaves rustling )

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,998
Come on.

5
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,546
( thunder rumbling )

6
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,096
- ( clicking )
- ( rustling )

7
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,228
- Come on.
- ( walkers growling )

8
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,029
( thunder rumbles )

9
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,126
( walkers growling )

10
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,802
( thumping on car )

11
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,321
- ( thunder booms )
- ( growling intensifies )

12
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,490
( heavy pounding )

13
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,923
( growling,
thunder stops )

14
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,091
( feet shuffling )

15
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,055
( pounding )

16
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,028
( birds chirping )

17
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,148
( theme music playing )

18
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,451
( clanging )

19
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,870
( rattling )

20
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,093
( hisses )

21
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,907
I need a drink.

22
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,748
No, I mean a real drink.

23
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,918
As in alcohol.

24
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,340
I've never had one.

25
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,219
'Cause of my dad.

26
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,806
But he's not exactly
around anymore, so...

27
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,063
I thought we could
go find some.

28
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,616
Okay.

29
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,829
Well, enjoy
your snake jerky.

30
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,809
Jerk.

31
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,519
- ( growling )
- ( gasps )

32
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,500
( thuds )

33
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,736
( twig snaps )

34
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,705
Beth: I think
we made it a way.

35
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,541
I'm pretty sure we got to go that way
to find the booze.

36
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,002
- ( clanging )
- What the hell?

37
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,629
You brought me back.

38
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,340
I'm not staying
in this suck-ass camp.

39
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,550
Hey!
You had your fun.

40
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,637
What the hell is wrong with you?
Do you feel anything?

41
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,139
Yeah, you think
everything's screwed.

42
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,557
I guess that's a feeling.

43
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,559
So you want to spend
the rest of our lives

44
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,686
staring into a fire
and eating mud snakes?

45
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,647
Screw that.

46
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,566
We might as well
do something.

47
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,401
I can take care
of myself

48
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,779
and I'm gonna get
a damn drink.

49
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,929
Golfers like to
booze it up, right?

50
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,270
Come on.

51
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,205
Might be people inside.

52
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,292
( thunder rumbling )

53
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,631
( rattling )

54
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,151
Come on.

55
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,321
( walkers snarling )

56
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,282
( snarling )

57
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,835
Why are you keeping
all that stuff?

58
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,340
( banging on door )

59
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,802
Come on.

60
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,934
( water dripping )

61
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,936
( bottle clinks )

62
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,017
( pans clang )

63
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,622
- ( growling )
- ( gasps )

64
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,008
( grunting )

65
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,566
( panting )

66
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,526
Thanks for the help.

67
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,736
You said you could
take care of yourself.

68
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,863
You did.

69
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,644
( clock chimes )

70
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,120
( ticking )

71
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,505
( gasps )

72
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,145
Help me take her down.

73
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,939
It don't matter.
She's dead.

74
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,441
It does matter.

75
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,409
Here.

76
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,835
( clock ticking )

77
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,137
( clock chiming )

78
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,265
Okay.

79
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,563
( walkers growling )

80
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,399
- Move.
- ( walkers growling )

81
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,198
( grunting )

82
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,792
( gasps )

83
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,254
( panting )

84
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,442
We made it.

85
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,323
I know you think
this is stupid.

86
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,034
And it probably is.

87
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,745
But I don't care.

88
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,997
All I wanted to do today
was lay down and cry,

89
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,416
but we don't get
to do that.

90
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,962
So beat up on walkers
if that makes you feel better.

91
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,757
I need to do this.

92
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,198
( glass shatters )

93
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,705
Did you have to
break the glass?

94
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,874
No.

95
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,418
You have your drink yet?

96
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,420
No.

97
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,714
But I found this.

98
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,844
Peach schnapps.

99
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,221
- Is it good?
- No.

100
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,643
Well, it's the only
thing left.

101
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,092
Who needs a glass?

102
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,219
( darts thunking )

103
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,038
( Beth crying )

104
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,651
Ain't gonna have
your first drink

105
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,569
be no damned
peach schnapps.

106
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,034
Come on.

107
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,757
Beth:
A motorcycle mechanic.

108
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,885
- Huh?
- That's my guess.

109
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,304
For what you were doing
before the turn.

110
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,390
Did Zack
ever guess that one?

111
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,975
It don't matter.

112
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,185
Hasn't mattered
for a long time.

113
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,521
It's just what
people talk about,

114
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,523
you know,
to feel normal.

115
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,860
Yeah, well, that never
felt normal to me.

116
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,534
Found this place
with Michonne.

117
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,372
I was expecting
a liquor store.

118
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,541
No, this is better.

119
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,019
What's that?

120
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,647
Moonshine.

121
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,401
Come on.

122
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,304
( blows )

123
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,474
All right.

124
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,604
That's a real
first drink right there.

125
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,110
What's the matter?

126
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,861
Nothing.

127
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,115
It's just...

128
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,742
my dad always said bad moonshine
can make you go blind.

129
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,370
Ain't nothing worth seeing
out there anymore anyway.

130
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,298
That's the most disgusting
thing I've ever tasted.

131
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,726
Second round's better.
( chuckles )

132
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,395
Slow down.

133
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,106
- This one's for you.
- No, I'm good.

134
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:46,484
- Why?
- Someone's got to keep watch.

135
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,236
So, what, you're like
my chaperone now?

136
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,155
Just drink lots of water.

137
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,365
Yes, Mr. Dixon.

138
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,665
( chuckles )

139
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,252
Who'd go into a store
and walk out with this?

140
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,255
My dad, that's who.

141
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,257
Oh, he's a dumbass.

142
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,551
He'd set those up
on top of the TV set,

143
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,511
use them
as target practice.

144
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,513
He shot things
inside your house?

145
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,349
It was just a bunch
of junk anyway.

146
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,393
That's how I knew
what this place was.

147
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,730
That shed out there,
my dad had a place just like this.

148
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,857
You got your
Dumpster chair.

149
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,861
That's for sitting in your drawers
all summer drinking.

150
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,905
Got your fancy buckets.

151
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,907
That's for spitting
chaw in

152
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,409
after your old lady
tells you to stop smoking.

153
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,371
You got your Internet.

154
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,708
( walker growling )

155
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,092
- It's just one of 'em.
- Should we get it?

156
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,261
If he keeps making
too much noise, yeah.

157
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,098
Well, if we're gonna
be trapped again,

158
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,392
we might as well
make the best of it.

159
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,105
Unless you're too busy
chaperoning, Mr. Dixon.

160
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,903
Hell, might as well
make the best of it.

161
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,414
Home, sweet home.

162
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,841
So first I say something
I've never done

163
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,802
and if you have done it,
you drink,

164
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,096
and if you haven't,
I drink.

165
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,890
Then we switch.

166
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,226
You really don't
know this game?

167
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,603
I never needed a game
to get lit before.

168
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,438
Wait, are we starting?

169
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,191
- How do you know this game?
- My friends played.

170
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,569
I watched.
Okay, I'll start.

171
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,991
I've never
shot a crossbow.

172
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,118
So now you drink.

173
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,662
Ain't much of a game.

174
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,957
That was a warm-up.
Now you go.

175
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,295
I don't know.

176
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,755
Just say the first thing
that pops into your head.

177
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,341
I've never been
out of Georgia.

178
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,886
Really?
Okay, good one.

179
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,392
I've never...

180
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,103
been drunk and did
something I regretted.

181
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,485
I've done a lot of things.

182
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,364
Your turn.

183
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,160
I've never been
on vacation.

184
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,745
What about camping?

185
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,914
No, that was just something
I had to learn, to hunt.

186
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,208
Your dad teach you?

187
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,252
Mm-hmm.

188
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,464
Okay.

189
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,180
I've never...

190
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,682
been in jail.

191
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,894
I mean, as a prisoner.

192
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,610
Is that what
you think of me?

193
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,111
I didn't mean
anything serious.

194
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,697
I just thought, you know,
like the drunk tank.

195
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,742
Even my dad got locked up
for that back in the day.

196
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,911
- Drink up.
- Wait.

197
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,496
Prison guard.

198
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,289
Were you
a prison guard before?

199
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,002
No.

200
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,091
It's your turn again.

201
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,722
I'm gonna take a piss.

202
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,727
- ( jar shatters )
- You have to be quiet.

203
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,729
Can't hear you!
I'm taking a piss!

204
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,231
Daryl, don't talk so loud.

205
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,732
What, are you
my chaperone now?

206
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,901
( urinating )

207
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,280
- ( zipper zips )
- Oh, wait.

208
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,241
It's my turn, right?

209
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,410
I've never--

210
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,913
never eaten
frozen yogurt.

211
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,249
Never had a pet pony.

212
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,918
Never got nothing
from Santa Claus.

213
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,879
Never relied on anyone
for protection before.

214
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,424
Hell, I don't think I've ever relied
on anyone for anything.

215
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,801
- Daryl.
- Never sung out in front of a big group

216
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,762
out in public
like everything was fun.

217
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,306
Like everything
was a big game.

218
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,894
I sure as hell never cut my wrists
looking for attention.

219
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,649
- ( thuds )
- ( walker growling )

220
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,068
Sounds like our friend out there
is trying to call all of his buddies.

221
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,363
- Daryl, just shut up.
- Hey, you never shot a crossbow before?

222
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,990
I'm gonna teach you
right now.

223
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,117
Come on.
It's gonna be fun.

224
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,537
We should stay inside.
Daryl, cut it out!

225
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,206
- Daryl!
- Dumbass.

226
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,876
Come here, dumbass.

227
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,461
- Daryl.
- You want to shoot?

228
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,588
- I don't know how.
- Oh, it's easy.

229
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,298
Come here.
Right corner.

230
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,633
Let's practice later.

231
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,886
- Come on, it's fun.
- Just stop it.

232
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,430
- Daryl!
- Come here.

233
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,643
- Eight ball.
- Just kill it!

234
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,645
Come here, Greene.
Let's pull these out.

235
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,148
Get a little more
target practice.

236
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,528
What the hell you do that for?
I was having fun.

237
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,614
No, you were being
a jackass.

238
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,824
- If anyone found my dad--
- Don't.

239
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,493
That ain't remotely the same.

240
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,995
Killing them is not
supposed to be fun.

241
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,872
What do you want
from me, girl, huh?

242
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,708
I want to you stop acting like you
don't give a crap about anything.

243
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,002
Like nothing
we went through matters.

244
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,047
Like none of the people we lost
meant anything to you.

245
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,633
It's bullshit!

246
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,677
- Is that what you think?
- That's what I know.

247
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,221
You don't know nothing.

248
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,098
I know you look at me
and you just see another dead girl.

249
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,644
I'm not Michonne.
I'm not Carol. I'm not Maggie.

250
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,604
I've survived
and you don't get it

251
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,732
'cause I'm not
like you or them.

252
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,110
But I made it and you don't get
to treat me like crap

253
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,321
just because
you're afraid.

254
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,618
I ain't afraid of nothing.

255
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,205
I remember.

256
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,376
When that little girl
came out of the barn

257
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,419
after my mom.

258
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,798
You were like me.

259
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,592
And now God forbid

260
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,844
you ever let anybody
get too close.

261
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,847
Too close, huh?
You know all about that.

262
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,101
You lost two boyfriends,
you can't even shed a tear.

263
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,435
Your whole family's gone,

264
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,603
all you can do is just go
out looking for hooch

265
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:38,896
like some dumb
college bitch.

266
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,231
Screw you.
You don't get it.

267
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,899
No, you don't get it!

268
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,569
- Everyone we know is dead!
- You don't know that!

269
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,238
Might as well be, 'cause you
ain't never gonna see 'em again.

270
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,868
Rick. You ain't never gonna
see Maggie again.

271
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,246
- Daryl, just stop.
- No!

272
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,208
The Governor rolled
right up to our gates.

273
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,506
Maybe if I wouldn't
have stopped looking.

274
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,717
Maybe 'cause I gave up.
That's on me.

275
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,760
- Daryl.
- No--

276
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,601
And your dad.

277
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,648
Maybe-- maybe I could
have done something.

278
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,035
( crying )

279
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,220
I get why my dad
stopped drinking.

280
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,806
You feel sick?

281
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,516
Nope.

282
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,520
I wish I could feel
like this all the time.

283
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,439
That's bad.

284
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,982
Hmm.

285
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,984
You're lucky
you're a happy drunk.

286
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,570
Yeah, I'm lucky.

287
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,490
Some people can be
real jerks when they drink.

288
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:16,285
Yeah, I'm a dick
when I'm drunk.

289
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,339
Merle had this dealer.

290
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,342
This janky
little white guy.

291
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,594
A tweaker.

292
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,515
One day we were
over at his house

293
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,475
watching TV.

294
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,523
Wasn't even noon yet
and we were all wasted.

295
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,818
Merle was high.

296
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,195
We were watching this show

297
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,532
and Merle was talking
all this dumb stuff about it.

298
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,909
And he wouldn't let up.

299
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,036
Merle never could.

300
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,417
Turns out

301
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,169
it was the tweaker's
kids' favorite show.

302
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,381
And he never sees
his kids,

303
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,843
so he felt guilty
about it or something.

304
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,764
So he punches
Merle in the face.

305
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:22,184
So I started hitting
the tweaker, like, hard.

306
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,020
As hard as I can.

307
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,481
Then he pulls a gun,

308
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,442
sticks it right here.

309
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,154
He says, "I'm gonna
kill you, bitch."

310
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,490
So Merle pulls
his gun on him.

311
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,993
Everyone's yelling.
I'm yelling.

312
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,582
I thought I was dead.

313
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:51,005
Over a dumb cartoon
about a talking dog.

314
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,096
How'd you get out of it?

315
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,310
The tweaker punched me
in the gut.

316
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,187
I puked.

317
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,940
They both started laughing
and forgot all about it.

318
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,072
You want to know
what I was before all this?

319
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,120
I was just drifting
around with Merle...

320
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,292
doing whatever he said
we were gonna be doing that day.

321
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,091
I was nobody.

322
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,805
Nothing.

323
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,976
Some redneck asshole

324
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,814
and an even bigger
asshole for a brother.

325
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,614
You miss him, don't you?

326
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,993
I miss Maggie.

327
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,957
I miss her bossing me around.
( laughs )

328
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,961
I miss
my big brother Shawn.

329
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,340
He was so annoying
and overprotective.

330
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,342
( laughs )

331
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,846
And my dad.

332
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,974
I thought--

333
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,768
I hoped he'd just live the rest
of his life in peace, you know?

334
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:35,276
I thought Maggie and Glenn
would have a baby.

335
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,780
And he'd get to be
a grandpa.

336
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:43,367
And we'd have birthdays
and holidays

337
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,619
and summer picnics.

338
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,709
And he'd get really old.

339
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,632
And it'd happen,
but it'd be quiet.

340
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,638
It'd be okay.

341
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,895
He'd be surrounded
by people he loved.

342
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,570
( laughs )

343
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,249
That's how unbelievably
stupid I am.

344
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,256
That's how
it was supposed to be.

345
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,431
I wish I could just...

346
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,767
change.

347
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,685
You did.

348
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,729
Not enough.

349
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,814
Not like you.

350
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,901
It's like you were made
for how things are now.

351
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,612
I'm just used to this,
things being ugly.

352
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,323
Growing up
in a place like this.

353
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,327
Well, you got
away from it.

354
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,038
- I didn't.
- You did.

355
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,041
Maybe you got to keep
on reminding me sometimes.

356
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,210
No.

357
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,921
You can't depend on anybody
for anything, right?

358
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,761
- I'll be gone someday.
- Stop.

359
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,471
I will.

360
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,143
You're gonna be
the last man standing.

361
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,941
You are.

362
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,034
You're gonna miss me
so bad when I'm gone, Daryl Dixon.

363
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,207
You ain't a happy
drunk at all.

364
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,168
Yeah, I'm happy.
I'm just not blind.

365
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:04,341
You got to stay
who you are,

366
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,218
not who you were.

367
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:11,181
Places like this,

368
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,559
you have to put it away.

369
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,105
What if you can't?

370
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,773
You have to.

371
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,861
Or it kills you.

372
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,497
Here.

373
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,341
We should go inside.

374
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,933
We should burn it down.

00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,564

376
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,331

more booze.
