1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,339
Governor: I have to talk all of you
into doing something.

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,926
Something I know we need to do.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,807
And I don't know how to talk about it.

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,270
What do you want us to do?

5
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,691
I want you to survive.

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,820
We're not gonna last here.

7
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,115
The biters, there'll be a herd of them.

8
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,992
They'll fill the pits,

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,704
they'll crawl over one another.

10
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,500
There'll be enough to tear
right through our camp.

11
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,546
Or it'll be people.

12
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,006
There's nothing between us
and the rest of the world.

13
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,552
Nothing between us and them.

14
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,515
We stay here, we'll die.

15
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:06,482
The people who destroyed the camp
I was in with Martinez...

16
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,527
they live in a prison.

17
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,030
It's north off Highway 34.

18
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,533
They got walls...

19
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,870
...fences,

20
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,748
plots of land for farming.

21
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,709
We could live there.

22
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,213
Uh-uh.

23
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,176
If we're willing to take it from 'em.

24
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,223
I have a plan to do it
without anyone getting hurt.

25
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,392
I captured two of them.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,436
What?

27
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,231
I was scouting the prison and our paths
crossed, so I took 'em.

28
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,859
- You took them?
- They're the key.

29
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:55,281
They're gonna help us take that prison
without firing a shot.

30
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,076
We can have it
and we don't need to kill anyone.

31
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,414
But...

32
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,835
we need to be prepared to.

33
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,214
( theme music playing )

34
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,001
The people in this prison,
not all of them are bad.

35
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,755
But most of them are thieves,

36
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,008
murderers.

37
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,678
Now why should people like that
have peace of mind

38
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,139
when we're burying our own
just about every day?

39
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:06,102
These people,
they mutilated me...

40
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,480
...burned my camp...

41
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,526
...killed my daughter.

42
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,947
Now you saw me-- I tried.

43
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,991
I tried to die.

44
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,952
'Cause I didn't want to accept
that you couldn't live in this world

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,871
without getting
blood on your hands.

46
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,331
I found you people
and I don't want to die.

47
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,334
I don't want you to die.

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,715
Now we need to move-- now.

49
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,675
They're gonna realize
their people are gone

50
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,386
and they're gonna start getting
ready for whatever's next.

51
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,347
We need to surprise them.
Scare them.

52
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,309
Huh?

53
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,519
And we will win.

54
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,194
I'm in.

55
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,031
- I'm in.
- Man: Me, too.

56
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,490
Pack up and get ready.

57
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,367
We'll go over the plan in half an hour.

58
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,037
- Come on.
- Man: Let's do it.

59
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,713
Where's Megan?

60
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,633
She's reading in the trailer.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,052
You hear all that?

62
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,554
I said we didn't have to fight
for another place.

63
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,890
I know.

64
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,559
Killing people?

65
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,271
No. Killing killers.

66
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,149
You said they weren't all bad people.

67
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,567
Well, they're with bad people.

68
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,236
Am I?

69
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,743
I'm gonna keep you alive.

70
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,205
I'm gonna keep Megan alive.

71
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,584
The only judgment on me I care about
is whether you two are still breathing.

72
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,755
It's good that you heard,

73
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,675
that you know.

74
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,845
Lily... I love you.

75
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,141
I don't know who you are.

76
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,186
Hey, you told me there has to be
someplace better

77
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,313
and that I was gonna
help you find it.

78
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,441
You knew me, Lily.

79
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,486
It was always gonna be like this.

80
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,117
You need to pack up, too.

81
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,210
- Michonne: Don't touch me.
- Governor: Stay still.

82
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,672
( hisses )
Get off me.

83
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:02,403
You should eat.
It's gonna be a long day.

84
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,488
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

85
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,367
I don't believe that.

86
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,328
Well, I don't care.

87
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,875
Just tell us what this is.
Please.

88
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,795
- It isn't personal.
- Then what is it?

89
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,759
Michonne,
I want you to know...

90
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,220
Penny, my daughter,

91
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,140
she was dead.
I know that now.

92
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,435
Now, I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt anyone.

93
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,103
I need the prison, that's it.

94
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,064
There are people
I need to keep alive.

95
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,940
You two are gonna help me take it.

96
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,359
No one needs to die.

97
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,570
I'm gonna kill you.

98
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,363
No, you won't.

99
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,116
- I'm gonna take my--
- Stop it.

100
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,743
You want the prison?

101
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:55,331
Yeah. And I'll take it
as peacefully as I can.

102
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,708
- Governor--
- Don't call me that.

103
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,797
Your people, our people,

104
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,841
we can find a way to live together.

105
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,386
These people you need to keep alive,

106
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,680
do you love them?

107
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:16,060
You're a good man, Hershel.
A better man than Rick.

108
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,396
Everything you've said,
the way you've said it,

109
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,858
you've changed.
So has Rick.

110
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,737
The two of us will never be able
to live together.

111
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,240
Michonne and I, we'll never be able
to live together.

112
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,368
- We'll find a way.
- I found a way!

113
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,207
I'm trying hard.

114
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,962
There's all kinds of ways
I could do this.

115
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,466
This way, you get to live
and I get to be...

116
00:07:55,475 --> 00:08:00,354
You say you want to take this prison
as peacefully as possible.

117
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,315
That means you'd be willing
to hurt people to get it.

118
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,818
My daughters would be there.

119
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,196
That's who you'd be hurting.

120
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,452
If you understand what it's like
to have a daughter,

121
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,290
then how can you threaten
to kill someone else's?

122
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,671
Because they aren't mine.

123
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,303
( door closes )

124
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,817
Ready?

125
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,486
- Here, take this.
- Okay.

126
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,114
They'll be safe here until we get back.

127
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,161
Biters can't make it across the water.

128
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,459
If it's safe by the water, then let's
just go someplace by the water.

129
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,377
- Lily.
- You don't have to do this.

130
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,505
Anyplace that's safe, really safe,

131
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,633
someone's already there.

132
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,845
Think about Megan, huh?

133
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,431
Lily:
I am.

134
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,060
What's she gonna be in this world?

135
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,190
She's gonna be alive.

136
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,627
Making mud pies?

137
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,630
- Peanut butter sandwiches.
- ( laughs )

138
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,436
How about a hug before I go?

139
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,981
My hands are muddy. See?

140
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,358
Oh, yeah.

141
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:13,153
Well, I wouldn't want
to get my coat dirty.

142
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,823
( laughs )

143
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,077
I messed it all up.

144
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,580
No, you made it better.

145
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,392
( sighs )

146
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,979
I could use a vacation.

147
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,356
- ( laughs )
- Get away.

148
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,859
Just for a weekend.

149
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,820
Yeah.

150
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,991
You know, our anniversary
is coming up.

151
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,576
It is?

152
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,453
One of these days.

153
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,080
( laughs )

154
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,877
You ever been to Amicalola Falls?

155
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,504
- Tallest waterfall in Georgia.
- Mm-mmm.

156
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,548
My dad took me there
when I was little.

157
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,634
When we were up there,

158
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,221
all the way at the top looking down,

159
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,931
I felt like I was flying.

160
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,561
I'll go load up the station wagon.

161
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,189
( laughs )

162
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,112
I'm gonna get you some water.

163
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,657
- I can get it.
- I know.

164
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,993
But I'm doing it.

165
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,832
I'll be right back.

166
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,261
Man, you couldn't have
waited till we got back?

167
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,430
Until Tyreese got back?

168
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,391
I could've handled that.

169
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,809
Hey. Hey.

170
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,728
She killed two of our own.

171
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,730
She couldn't be here.

172
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,567
She's gonna be all right.

173
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,445
She has a car, supplies, weapons.

174
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,531
She's a survivor.

175
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,200
Stop saying that
like you don't believe it.

176
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:31,667
She did it.
She said it was for us.

177
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,752
That's how it was in her head.

178
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,630
She wasn't sorry.

179
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,842
Man, that's her, but that ain't her.

180
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,306
What are we supposed to do
about those two girls?

181
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,562
I told her we'd look after them.

182
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,698
I haven't told Tyreese yet.

183
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,121
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

184
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,296
Let's go find out.

185
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,184
( footsteps approaching )

186
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,274
Bob.

187
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,446
You should be resting.

188
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,656
After the night you had, so should you.

189
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,408
I'm going to.

190
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,869
On my way to find
an open cell in C block

191
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,205
until D gets cleaned up.

192
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,919
I just wanted to say thank you.

193
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,298
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Hershel

194
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,342
and you.

195
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,429
( sighs )
Hershel, not me.

196
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,515
- You helped save my life.
- Stop.

197
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,933
- Bob.
- Stop.

198
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,227
You put those meds in my IV bag.

199
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,856
And now, in a couple minutes,
I'm gonna feel the sun on my skin.

200
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,570
So you are gonna let me thank you.

201
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,409
( gasps )

202
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,870
Sasha.

203
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,997
You're not strong enough yet.

204
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,875
Then help me.

205
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,463
Tyreese. You down here?

206
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,549
Tyreese:
Rick, that you?

207
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,015
You guys got to see this.

208
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,268
Can we take a beat? There's something
we need to talk about.

209
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,645
It can wait. Come on.

210
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,572
Look.

211
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,952
The hell?

212
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,706
I was just looking for...

213
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,457
answers...

214
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,043
and I found this.

215
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,548
Same person that killed
Karen and David did this.

216
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,675
Remember the rats at the fence?

217
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,927
They showed up the same day
she was killed.

218
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,054
We got a psychopath living with us.

219
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,140
- Tyreese.
- We got to find him, Rick.

220
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,434
And I'm not gonna sleep until we do.

221
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,771
Tyreese...

222
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,024
whoever did this,

223
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,359
I don't think that's who killed Karen.

224
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,195
Why?

225
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,740
( explosion )

226
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,366
Come on.

227
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,124
Get back!

228
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,095
Rick!

229
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,514
Come down here.

230
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,808
We need to talk.

231
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,076
It's not up to me.

232
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,914
There's a council now.
They run this place.

233
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,333
Is Hershel on the council?

234
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,517
What about Michonne?

235
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,479
She on the council, too?

236
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,985
I don't make decisions anymore.

237
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,074
You're making the decisions today, Rick.

238
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,744
Come down here.

239
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,163
Let's have that talk.

240
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,915
( faintly )
We can do this. All right?

241
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,050
( squeaks )

242
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,036
We can't take 'em all on.

243
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,331
We'll go through the admin building,
through the woods like we planned.

244
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,917
We ain't got the numbers no more.

245
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,419
When's the last time someone checked
the stash on the bus?

246
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,379
Day before we hit the Big Spot.

247
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,465
We were running low on rations then.
We're lower now.

248
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,258
Yeah, we'll manage.

249
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,803
Things go south,
everyone heads for that bus.

250
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,970
Let everybody know.

251
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,348
What if everybody doesn't know
when things go bad?

252
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,099
How long do we wait?

253
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,560
As long as we can.

254
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,193
Let 'em go right now.

255
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,530
I'll stay down here.

256
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,783
Talk as long as you want.

257
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,827
But you let 'em go.

258
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,663
You got a tank.
You don't need hostages.

259
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,499
I do.

260
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,460
This is just to show you I'm serious.

261
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,297
Not to blast a hole in our new home.

262
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,468
You and your people, you have
till sundown to get out of here

263
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,137
or they die.

264
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,057
Doesn't have to go down this way.

265
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,727
I got more people, more firepower.

266
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,108
We need this prison.

267
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,030
There it is.

268
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,034
It's not about the past.
It's about right now.

269
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,079
There are children here.

270
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,124
Some of them are sick.
They won't survive.

271
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,298
I have a tank.

272
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,925
And I'm letting you walk away from here.

273
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,721
What else is there to talk about?

274
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,457
You good?

275
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,877
Yeah.

276
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,343
( faintly )
All right.

277
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,903
Megan:
Mommy, can you please help me dig?

278
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,499
Mommy, can you please help me?

279
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,334
I'll be right there, honey.

280
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,798
Mommy, it's too heavy.

281
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,053
I hear you. I'll be there in a sec.

282
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,579
Lily:
I'm sorry, honey. What did you say?

283
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,540
It's okay. I can do it myself.

284
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,121
( screaming )

285
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,999
Megan! Megan!

286
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,752
- ( snarling )
- Mommy! Mommy!

287
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,671
( screaming )
Mommy!

288
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,924
Megan!

289
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,550
( crunches )

290
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,928
Megan!

291
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,062
Governor:
I could shoot you all.

292
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,981
You'd all shoot back.
I know that.

293
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,235
But we'll win and you'll be dead.
All of you.

294
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:11,407
Doesn't have to be like that.
Like I said, it's your choice.

295
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,370
( walkers snarling )

296
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,255
( gunshots )

297
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,017
Noise will only draw
more of them over.

298
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,104
The longer you wait,

299
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,731
the harder it will be
for you to get out of here.

300
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,739
We got to do something.

301
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,908
Your dad's got it.

302
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:57,162
They're talking.
We could kill the Governor right now.

303
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,540
- From 50 yards?
- I'm a good shot.

304
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,042
I could end this right now.

305
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,837
Yeah, or you could start something else.

306
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,548
You got to trust him.

307
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,264
We're here.

308
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,057
Where are you guys going?

309
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,435
- To the bus. Come on.
- No.

310
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,646
You know the plan.
That's where we're supposed to go.

311
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,941
Carol told us to be strong,
to protect ourselves.

312
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,528
They have guns.
We should have guns, too.

313
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,238
We should help.

314
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,370
You got maybe about an hour
of sunlight left.

315
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,248
I suggest you start packing.

316
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,681
The longer you wait,

317
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,100
the harder it's gonna be
for you to get out of here.

318
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,315
We can all--

319
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,239
we can all live together.

320
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,744
There's enough room for all of us.

321
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,038
More than enough.

322
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,666
But I don't think
my family would sleep well

323
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,543
knowing that you
were under the same roof.

324
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,088
We'd live in different cell blocks.

325
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:34,425
We'd never have to see each other
till we're all ready.

326
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,595
It could work.

327
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,681
You know it could.

328
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,684
It could've.

329
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,103
But it can't.

330
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,648
Not after Woodbury.

331
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,651
Not after Andrea.

332
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,529
Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

333
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,199
Fact is, it's gonna be
a hell of a lot harder

334
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:02,078
than standing here
shooting at each other.

335
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,373
But I don't think we have a choice.

336
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,961
We don't. You do.

337
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,839
We're not leaving.

338
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,595
You try and force us, we'll fight back.

339
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,724
Like you said,

340
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,684
the gunshots will just
bring more of them out.

341
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,060
They'll take down the fences.

342
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,731
Without the fences,
this place is worthless.

343
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,736
Now, we can all live in the prison

344
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,696
or none of us can.

345
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,079
We'll fix the damn fences.

346
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,876
- No--!
- ( sobbing )

347
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,515
You. You in the ponytails.

348
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,477
Is this what you want?
Is this what any of you want?

349
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,855
What we want is what you got.

350
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,149
Period.

351
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,194
Time for you to leave, asshole.

352
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,820
Look, I fought him before.

353
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:21,532
And after, we took in his old friends.

354
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,869
They've become leaders
in what we have here.

355
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,122
Now you put down your weapons,

356
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,166
walk through those gates...

357
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,961
you're one of us.

358
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,642
We let go of all of it,

359
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,019
and nobody dies.

360
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,525
Everyone who's alive right now.

361
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,279
Everyone who's made it this far.

362
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,867
We've all done the worst kinds of things
just to stay alive.

363
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,413
But we can still come back.

364
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,124
We're not too far gone.

365
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,504
We get to come back.

366
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,381
I know...

367
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:22,677
we all can change.

368
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,285
Liar.

369
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,670
( silent )

370
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,135
No!

371
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,845
Ah!

372
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,473
( gunfire )

373
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,352
- ( screams )
- Daddy!

374
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,814
Ah!

375
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,375
( gasping )

376
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,156
You!

377
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,701
Pick up your weapon!
Fight, now!

378
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,664
( gunfire popping, ringing )

379
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,468
This isn't right.

380
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,095
- We're not supposed to be doing this.
- We are.

381
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:31,681
He chopped a guy's head off
with a sword.

382
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,527
( hammer clicks )

383
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,492
We have to stay here.
It's too late, you understand me?

384
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,413
Stay behind me and if we get separated,
you just go run somewhere safe and hide.

385
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,665
You hear me?
You go someplace safe and hide

386
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,876
and I will find you when this
is all over. I will find you.

387
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,837
Go through the fence in your cars.

388
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,214
Get your guns, we go in.

389
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,383
Kill them all.

390
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,428
Roger that. Move in!

391
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,964
Go ahead!

392
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,727
I'm out of ammo.

393
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,729
Run for the bus. I'll cover you.

394
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,444
Move up!

395
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,417
Go! Get out of here!

396
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,226
Go, go! Come on!
Glenn's in there. I have to get him.

397
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,645
- I'm going with you.
- Get these people on the bus.

398
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,772
- Be ready to drive. I'll be right back.
- What if you're not?

399
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,607
- You have to go without us.
- I won't go without you.

400
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,026
Beth, get these people
on the bus, okay?

401
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,237
It's your job.
We've all got jobs to do.

402
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,119
( grunts )

403
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,547
- Glenn!
- What the hell's going on?

404
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,383
We have to get everybody out of here.

405
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,513
( grunts )

406
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,765
Beth! Where's Beth?

407
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,683
- She went to find you.
- Where?

408
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,810
- We'll find her. She'll be okay.
- No.

409
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,021
What? No, you're not going
by yourself.

410
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,315
I'll be right back.

411
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,443
Maggie...

412
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,903
( fist thumps )

413
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,797
( snarling )

414
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,465
Ah!

415
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,727
( snarls )

416
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,819
On your right.

417
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,741
Grenade!

418
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,670
Sasha! Sasha!
Have you seen Beth?

419
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,964
- Is she on the bus?
- No. She's--

420
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,799
Ah!

421
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,678
We gotta stay down.

422
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:24,014
Look inside my shirt.
Check my back for an exit wound.

423
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,724
Yeah.

424
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,269
That's good.
We can treat it.

425
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,521
- Sasha: Not here.
- Stay down. We'll find someplace safe.

426
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,694
We'll figure it out.
Come on.

427
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,511
- ( gunshot )
- ( groans )

428
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,684
( gunshot )

429
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,984
( snarling )

430
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,112
We got to get out of here.

431
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,783
Hey! We go that way!

432
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,785
( coughing )

433
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,266
( grunts )

434
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,940
( gasping )

435
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,027
( coughing )

436
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,116
Carl...?

437
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,952
Where's Carl?

438
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,079
I don't know.

439
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,005
( Governor moaning )

440
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,490
( grenade rattling )

441
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,867
Grenade!

442
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,144
I was trying to find the kids
to get them on the bus.

443
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,480
We got to go, Beth.
We got to go.

444
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,738
( groans )

445
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,741
Carl!

446
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,577
Carl!

447
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,998
Carl!

448
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,959
Carl?

449
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,796
( snarling )

450
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,468
( gunshots )

451
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,232
Judith.

452
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,817
Where is she?

453
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,612
I don't know.

454
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,970
No.

455
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,848
( sobbing )

456
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,241
Carl. Carl.

457
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,409
( sobbing )

458
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,329
We've got to get out of here.

459
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,206
We've got to go.

460
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,791
Shh. Shh. Shh.

461
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,336
It's over. It's over. It's over.

462
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,472
( snarling )

463
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,247
( gunshot )

464
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:06,231
Don't look back, Carl.

465
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,942
Just keep walking.
