Here, this one is a little big for me,
but I think it'll look great on you.

182
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,791
Oh, how lovely. Thank you.

183
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,666
[sighs] I want to hear everything.

184
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,833
-Well, um, everything's good.
-Okay.

185
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,916
-Really good.
-Good. And…

186
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,750
-And I really like it here.
-Is Wilhelm settling in?

187
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,833
-Uh, yeah, sure. Well, I think so.
-"Think"?

188
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,291
What? No. Come on, tell me.

189
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,916
I'm just getting a good vibe. That's all.

190
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,208
-A good vibe. From Wilhelm?
-Mmm.

191
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,458
-Yes, but how?
-Well, uh…

192
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,458
You know, glances and stuff.

193
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,083
[chuckles] Yes, I know. Indeed I do.

194
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,541
And I can see
that he likes everything you post.

195
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,458
Yeah.

196
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,291
It's exciting. Really exciting.

197
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,458
-You must keep me posted.
-I promise.

198
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,291
-Really promise.
-Promise.

199
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,791
Yes? Good.

200
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,000
My baby…

201
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,708
[woman] A big Hillerska smile!

202
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,500
[all laugh]

203
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,500
[indistinct chatter]

204
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,166
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,750
Excuse me.
I'll be right back, okay? Thank you.

206
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,541
-Hey.
-What's up?

207
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,083
Lunch won't be open to everyone today

208
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,916
since it's Parents' Day.

209
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,500
What? But that's why we're here.

210
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,958
Parents Day isn't for non-boarders.

211
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,083
Only boarders.

212
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,916
But our mom is already here.

213
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,875
I see. This must be a big deal for her.

214
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,666
Hey. You know what? I can fix this.

215
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,750
I'll move some tables around
to make space for you.

216
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,416
Lunch is in one hour.

217
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,125
I'll keep you posted.

218
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,833
-For fuck's sake.
-Stop it. Just let it go.

219
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,666
[groans]

220
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,916
You can wait there.

221
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,833
Hi, Wilhelm. The photographer
wants to take a picture of us.

222
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,875
There.

223
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,125
And is this…?

224
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,708
[shutter clicking]

225
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,500
Can you take one where we're just talking?

226
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,083
-Pretend I'm saying something clever.
-Okay.

227
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,500
[photographer] That's it. Thanks.

228
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,666
Good. I have to make a call. Excuse me.

229
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,666
Come on! You can't
just sit there stuck in your room.

230
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,041
Go and join the others.

231
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:25,458
[sighs] No, but I can't be bothered
going around greeting everybody.

232
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,833
[Erik] Come on, it's not that hard.

233
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,583
It's gonna look real strange
if you don't show up.

234
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,875
To me, it feels weird if I show up, Erik.

235
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,333
God, you are such a dork.

236
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,458
It's not that hard.

237
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,791
Go out there, say hello, shake
a few hands, pretend to be someone else.

238
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,833
[Wilhelm sighs loudly]

239
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,458
What? We'll see each other this weekend.

240
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:47,666
Well…

241
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,666
I was going to talk to you about that.

242
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:55,750
Because, uh, I was thinking
about staying here this weekend.

243
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,416
What? Why?

244
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,791
To, uh, study.

245
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,750
I'm behind, so I need to catch up a bit.

246
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,833
[Erik scoffs]

247
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,625
-What?
-[chuckles]

248
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,125
Are you, Wilhelm,
my little brother, staying in school?

249
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,125
What's so strange about that? Yes.

250
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,833
[Erik laughs] You've met someone.

251
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,333
[laughs]

252
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,125
Hello?

253
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,083
I, uh…

254
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,750
Yes, okay, but I…

255
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:36,833
I don't think we're a couple or anything.
I don't know what it is, but can we just…

256
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,291
I get it. I get it.
You don't have to tell me any…

257
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,125
I don't wanna hear any details.

258
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,125
[frustrated grunt]

259
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,000
Hey. Wille, enjoy yourself.

260
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,583
Soon enough
people will start having opinions and--

261
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,416
They don't care about me. 'Cause
you're Crown Prince they have opinions.

262
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,500
I don't get it.

263
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,958
Why are you sitting in your room sulking
when you have a crush to hang out with?

264
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,750
Fuck you. It's not a crush.

265
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,708
[scoffs] So what would you call it then?

266
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,375
Goodbye, Erik. Goodbye.

267
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,375
-Okay, goodbye.
-You're so annoying. Goodbye.

268
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,166
I don't wanna go in there.
We're not even invited. Fuck this.

269
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,208
Stop it.

270
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,125
Don't worry. It's just a misunderstanding.

271
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,291
He told you that.

272
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,916
There, we're all set. Please enter.

273
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,833
Okay.

274
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,875
[in Spanish] Come on, sweetheart.

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,416
[in English] Thank you very much.

276
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,000
[soft piano music playing]

277
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:43,208
Well, it was my grandmother,
and my mother and I,

278
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,708
So, Felice is the fourth generation
to attend Hillerska.

279
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,041
How about that?

280
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,541
That's right. She's the fourth
Hillerska equestrian generation.

281
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,333
When I attended,
I practically lived in the stable.

282
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:58,208
I just couldn't tear myself away.
It is so amazingly character-building.

283
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,083
What are your plans for the future?

284
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,041
My goal is to go to Alnarp next year.

285
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,333
I want to study
agricultural economics and management.

286
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,250
Ah.

287
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,250
Then I'll continue
to develop and modernize Årnäs.

288
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,166
Carry on the family legacy.
Excuse me, that's not necessary.

289
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,000
You must be a very… [chuckles]

290
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,375
proud father.

291
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,625
Oh. Ha.

292
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,208
-He isn't my son.
-No, I'm not his son.

293
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,875
-But I feel very inspired by--
-My father was Carl Johan Horn of Årnäs.

294
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:31,333
Årnäs has been in the family since 1768,
and I intend to keep it that way.

295
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,250
Yes… August?

296
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,208
Hmm?

297
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,083
I need to speak to you. Later.

298
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,041
Quiet. I know.

299
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,958
Well… [chuckles]
I thought he was sitting with you.

300
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,625
-Hi, Wilhelm.
-Hi, Felice.

301
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,833
May I join you?

302
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,333
Yeah.

303
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,291
-Hello, Smysan.
-Hi.

304
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,333
-Poppe.
-Hi.

305
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,791
[in Spanish] Mama, this is Wilhelm.

306
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,625
Wilhelm, this is Mom.

307
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,875
[in English] I mean Linda.

308
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,583
Hello, Linda, Wilhelm.
Pleasure to meet you.

309
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,250
Nice to meet you too.

310
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,125
Apparently, I'm the only one
who doesn't know everybody.

311
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,625
[all chuckling]

312
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,708
Now you do.

313
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,708
[Poppe]
You become a bit like family here.

314
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:39,666
Mm. So true. Do you still ride, Wilhelm?

315
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,916
Occasionally. I'm on the rowing team now.

316
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,583
[Smysan] Yes, of course you are,
just like Erik was.

317
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:48,458
-Sara rides.
-Oh, you do? How nice.

318
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,541
-What kind of horse do you have?
-I don't have my own. I ride Rousseau.

319
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,958
[Smysan] I see.
So you ride Felice's horse?

320
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,750
Uh… [clears throat]
Well, I ride Rousseau.

321
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,666
Uh, I ride Rousseau
every morning, almost every evening.

322
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,000
I clean his box, I feed him. I ride him.

323
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,333
But why are you riding Rousseau?

324
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,208
Because Felice doesn't want to.

325
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,208
Felice?

326
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,333
Excuse me.

327
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,916
[clears throat]

328
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,333
Excuse me.

329
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,083
[Simon in Spanish]
You don't need to share everything.

330
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,666
Felice, what's wrong?

331
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,458
[sobbing]

332
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,375
Hey?

333
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,041
[sniffles]

334
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,875
Tell me.

335
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,458
Whatever I do, I can't do anything right.

336
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,916
That's not true.

337
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,625
Everybody thinks you're perfect.

338
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,208
You know that, right?

339
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,625
Do you think so?

340
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,208
Of course.

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,541
Oh, I didn't… [clears throat]

342
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,041
I didn't mean to…

343
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,291
Um…

344
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,666
I just meant…

345
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,708
[Linda] This is such a beautiful place.

346
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,708
It's so stunning.

347
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,833
Hey.

348
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,083
What? They were nice.

349
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,250
[August] Two semesters?
Surely you can pay for that.

350
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,750
-You said you were going to fix this.
-I don't have the resources.

351
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,750
You'll have to liquidate.

352
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,750
You have things at Årnäs that are…

353
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,000
uh, land, art.

354
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,791
You could pay your tuition
a hundred times over.

355
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:24,875
I'd rather die.

356
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,083
Even Carl Johan
could survive on his last name in the end.

357
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,750
You certainly didn't
make life easier for him.

358
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,791
There's no need to…

359
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,416
Well, okay then.

360
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,333
That's great.
Then I know that I can't count on you.

361
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:50,625
Just great.

362
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,208
-You know what? I don't need you.
-You can count on me.

363
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,958
No, I've never needed you.

364
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,333
I'll take care of myself.

365
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,875
You can leave now. Go home.
I'm staying here for the weekend.

366
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,833
[in Spanish] Darling, are you okay?

367
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:05,916
[Sara] What? I'm fine.

368
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:11,291
[Simon] You go without me.
I gotta take care of something.

369
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:14,333
-[in Spanish] Don't you want a ride
-It's okay. I'll take the bus later.

370
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:21,541
Hey!

371
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,416
August!

372
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,291
No. Not now, okay?

373
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,250
Stop, I'm talking to you.

374
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,500
You owe me.

375
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,958
You fucking owe me
after the favor I did you.

376
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:35,666
What? At least tell me when. Listen.

377
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,166
Back off, okay?

378
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,208
You're fucking crazy!

379
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,083
[boy] Well, see you!

380
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:10,958
Good night, guys.

381
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,250
-[laughter]
-[indistinct chatter]

382
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,041
Now I owe both my dad and the school,
because August won't pay me back.

383
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,166
But you said
you wouldn't see Micke anymore.

384
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,125
You know it only causes trouble.

385
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,708
-And then you stole his meds?
-I know.

386
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:44,416
To him it's just spare change.
He's just doing it to fuck with me.

387
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,916
Okay, but… what can we do?

388
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:56,333
We need to make him see that I'm serious.

389
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:57,791
Okay, we'll have a chat with him.

390
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,083
[boy] August, come on. It's time to go.

391
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,000
[Rosh] Yeah, but he kept going on and on,

392
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:14,000
then the teacher tried to get a word in,

393
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,708
just 'cause he forgot
some detail, just to help him.

394
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:17,625
Yeah.

395
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:22,875
[August] What the hell are you doing here?

396
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:23,833
August.

397
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,458
Transfer the money right now.

398
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:32,875
Oh, so you brought
your gangsters with you. Huh?

399
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,333
Are you threatening me?

400
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:36,375
Give me your phone.

401
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:38,666
Make the transfer now.

402
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,625
Just go home.

403
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:48,000
You bastard.
What the fuck is your problem?

404
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,875
-Huh?
-What the hell are you doing?

405
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:52,375
You think it's fun
to fuck with people like me?

406
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,458
-Huh?
-[August] You sick bastard. Stop!

407
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:56,666
[Simon] I'm so fucking tired of you.

408
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,708
[Rosh] Simon, stop.

409
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,375
I need my money!

410
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,416
-[August groans]
-[Rosh] Simon!

411
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,958
-Let go. Let go!
-Simon.

412
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,500
-Simon. Simon.
-Ah!

413
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,166
[August grunts]

414
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,958
[Rosh] What are you doing?

415
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,750
He's fucking with me!

416
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,166
I want my money!

417
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:20,583
Can't you understand that?

418
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,875
If I had it,
I would have given it to you. Okay?

419
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:27,791
I have no money.
My family's broke. I have nothing left.

420
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,125
Okay?

421
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:38,541
I don't care. You're gonna pay me.

422
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,000
[sobs]

423
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,000
I don't know what they're
doing to you at that school,

424
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,166
but you're no better than him.

425
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:33,041
[engine revs]

426
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,291
-Ayub, I'm sorry.
-I don't wanna hear it.

427
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,291
[man on TV speaking Spanish]

428
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,083
-[in Spanish] Hi.
-Hi, sweetie.

429
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,958
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

430
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,250
[Sara in English] Where have you been?

431
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,583
Shit, you scared me.

432
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,250
At school.

433
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,000
Were you hanging out with Wilhelm?

434
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,708
I've seen the way you look at each other.

435
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,875
Why are you two sneaking around?

436
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,750
He wants it that way.

437
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,500
It's really complicated.

438
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:40,791
Simon,
we promised each other, no secrets.

439
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:41,916
I know.

440
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,958
I was going to tell you but, um…

441
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,541
Sometimes it's better to keep quiet.

442
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:50,791
Do you understand?

443
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,333
Mm.

444
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,000
Please, don't tell anyone.

445
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,500
I promise.

446
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,625
But you like him, don't you?

447
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,208
-Huh?
-Yeah?

448
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,708
-Of course you do.
-No, I…

449
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,333
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

450
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,250
[both laugh]

451
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,375
-Come on.
-What are you talking about?

452
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,416
-I want to know everything!
-No!

453
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,916
-Has anything happened yet?
-Stop it, Sara.

454
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,416
-Did you kiss the Prince? [giggles]
-Stop it!

455
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,625
-Please!
-You're annoying. [laughs]

456
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:28,125
-I will tell you everything.
-Spill the beans.

457
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:32,125
-I will tell you… tomorrow.
-What the?

458
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,791
[knocking]

459
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,041
[knocking]

460
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,250
-Hi.
-Hi.

461
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,458
May I come in?

462
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:16,041
Yeah. [laughs nervously] Sure.

463
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,958
I know you're interested, so…

464
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,166
Here I am.

465
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,166
-[in Spanish] Have a nice day.
-You too, Mom.

466
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,333
Thanks.

467
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:43,500
[in English] Um, by the way,
I'm staying at Ayub's tonight.

468
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:44,416
Okay.

469
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:46,833
[chuckles]

470
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:51,041
[Vincent] Well, here's the thing.
Our parents knew each other growing up.

471
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,708
They dated for a year before…

472
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,458
Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.

473
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,000
[Henry] Whoa. That's crazy. I had no idea.

474
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,416
-I know.
-How long have you known?

475
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:05,416
Well, I know because
my dad recognized your last name.

476
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,916
So he asked me
if I know you or your family.

477
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,041
[Henry] Oh, okay.

478
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,166
[message sends]

479
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,666
[cell phone chimes]

480
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:18,958
WILHELM: HEY, CAN WE TALK?

481
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,833
-Hi.
-Hi.

482
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,500
August is staying here this weekend.

483
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,166
I heard him talk about it,

484
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,625
and now he's going
to be on my ass all weekend.

485
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:41,458
So…

486
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:43,500
what do you think?

487
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,750
That I won't be able to stay here.

488
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,083
[cell phone vibrates]

489
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,125
But, uh…

490
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,875
Do you think…

491
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,083
that maybe I could, um…

492
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:07,875
maybe I could come to Bjärstad instead.

493
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,666
To my house?

494
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,375
I just want to…

495
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,541
hang out with you.

496
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:24,708
With me and Mom? Or what?

497
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,708
Exactly.

498
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,416
She was awesome.

499
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,166
[laughs]

500
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,000
[girl] Look, there he is.

501
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,750
Do you think he knows?

502
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:42,875
You okay?

503
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,916
[indistinct murmuring]

504
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,791
-I don't think so.
-Go on, tell him.

505
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:01,333
Should we say anything about it?
Should we tell him?

506
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,625
[man] Wilhelm!

507
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,625
Wilhelm, could you please, uh…

508
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,458
could you please come with me?

509
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,541
-[Wilhelm] What's going on?
-Please, just come with me.

510
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,083
[Wilhelm] Hi.

[door closes]

512
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,916
Uh, what's going on?

513
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,416
Please take a seat, Wilhelm.

514
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:00,166
Have I done
something wrong or is anything…

515
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,708
[telephone rings]

517
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,583
Yes, he's here.

518
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,708
[clears throat] Yes. Wilhelm speaking.

519
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,416
Wilhelm, it's your mother.

520
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:20,125
Hi.

521
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:22,500
What's the matter?

[Queen breathes shakily]

523
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,083
It's…

524
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,250
It… it's Erik.

525
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:47,500
He was going too fast and lost control.

526
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:48,458
What?

527
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,208
He was in a car accident.

528
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:55,000
[breathing heavily]

529
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,791
[Queen sobs softly on phone]

530

Wil… Wilhelm…

531
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,208
Erik is dead.
