00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,458
[shivers]

181
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,375
You're freezing.

182
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,083
No, she told me the ritual
would make me warm so it's…

183
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,416
Here.

184
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,416
Now you don't have to freeze.

185
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,875
Felice! We have to finish the ritual

186
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,750
Sorry. My fault.

187
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,625
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

188
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,750
Well, I better…

189
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,916
You want to join us?

190
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,791
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

191
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,500
[laughing] Okay.

192
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,666
If I'm allowed.

193
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,708
-[Madison] Yeah, come on.
-Come.

194
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,750
[clears throat]

195
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,208
[Madison] You can stand there.

196
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,083
I haven't smeared any coal
across my forehead. That's okay, right?

197
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,583
-That's okay.
-Here you go.

198
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,416
[Madison] Say after me.

199
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,708
Negative energy, I ban thee.

200
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,750
[both] Negative energy, I ban thee.

201
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,208
[doorbell rings]

202
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,041
[doorbell rings]

203
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,458
[doorknob rattles]

204
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,458
[TV playing indistinctly]

205
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,708
Hello?

206
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,083
I need to talk to you about Sara.

207
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,166
Hey, Dad?

208
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,375
[snoring]

209
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,583
You're a worthless drunk.

210
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,625
[panting]

211
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,083
[August]
Don't press too hard, I'll come too fast.

212
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,083
[both moaning]

213
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,583
Did you close your eyes?

214
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,208
What? No.

215
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,666
What the hell? You closed your eyes.

216
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,333
You're thinking about someone else.

217
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,083
-Is that it?
-No.

218
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,208
You don't even…
Aren't you even gonna answer me?

219
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,708
[sighs]

220
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,333
It's Wille.

221
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,041
But August…

222
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,791
[sighs] You know, I…

223
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,958
I've just had
a lot going on lately so it's…

224
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,083
I don't know…

225
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,291
No, you haven't. You haven't even…

226
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,541
[laughter]

227
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,666
How nice to see some smiles.

228
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,958
It's been too long.

229
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,083
-Okay.
-See you later.

230
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,250
Whoa.

231
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,041
What's up with you two?

232
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,625
So, you're an actual proper couple now?

233
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,625
Mm.

234
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,625
Since when did you
start liking him for real?

235
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,416
Come on, Felice, give us the details.

236
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,083
Hey, wait up. Did you sleep together?

237
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,375
[Madison] Was it royal?

238
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,250
August.

239
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,958
You're gonna sell this.

240
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,458
I'm giving you a chance to pay me back.

241
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,125
[scoffs]

242
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,166
Are you kidding?

243
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,083
-No, no.
-Yes, you are.

244
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,333
[girls giggling]

245
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,291
You're gonna pay me back
every penny you owe me.

246
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,708
I can't help you.

247
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,291
Well, then I guess
you don't care if everyone knows.

248
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,250
What?

249
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,875
That you're broke.

250
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:26,916
Right?

251
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,291
You know what?

252
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,083
With national tests coming up,
they're gonna sell like hot cakes.

253
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,625
Fine, I'll do it.

254
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,375
But then you shut the fuck up!

255
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,666
[footsteps approaching]

256
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,833
[Felice] The bus has stopped running.

257
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,333
I know. I'm waiting for my mom.

258
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,458
Are you angry?

259
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,666
Yes.

260
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,541
I'm sorry about the Parents' Lunch.
I really had no idea.

261
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,791
I never meant to.
I… I was just being honest.

262
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,750
Sometimes it's better
not to say everything.

263
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,208
I want us to be friends again.

264
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,625
Me too.

265
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,625
[car approaching]

266
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,333
-See you tomorrow.
-Mm. Bye.

267
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,416
He refused to leave.

268
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,750
You weren't picking up.

269
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,083
Did you call?

270
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,541
Sorry. It was on mute.

271
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,916
Why have you got Wille's jacket?

272
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,541
I bumped into him
on the way to class yesterday,

273
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:28,916
I just forgot to return it.

274
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,458
-But I'll do it later.
-I'm going there now. I'll take it.

275
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,166
But wait, are you angry?

276
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,083
No, I'm not angry! I…

277
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,500
-Yeah, but… we just talked.
-Okay.

278
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,791
We just talked about his brother.

279
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,791
Erik was like a brother
to me too, and you know that.

280
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,416
Your focus should be on
comforting me so that I can comfort him.

281
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,500
Give me the jacket! Give it to me.

282
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,666
Dump him.

283
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,541
Hi there. Can I help you?

284
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,875
-I'm just dropping this off.
-This?

285
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:15,333
-We're family. Nothing to worry about.
-I see.

286
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,583
-I'll take it.
-[laughs] Stubborn, that's good.

287
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,000
[bodyguard] I'll give it to him.

288
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,333
Thank you.

289
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,000
Just tell him that I stopped by.

290
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,125
-Of course.
-Good.

291
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:47,500
PAYMENT FROM AUGUST

292
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,500
[Wilhelm laughing]
How can one move like that?

293
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:55,625
[Felice] I know! It's crazy. Unbelievable.

294
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,125
-I need to find that video. It's so funny.
-Go ahead.

295
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,958
-I'm sure you look great.
-Here it is.

296
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,916
-Let me see.
-No, I look crazy.

297
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,291
[both laughing]

298
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,083
[Wilhelm] I mean it, that's so cute.

299
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:12,083
-That's so cute. You're really sweet.
-Oh God! Whatever…

300
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,541
-See you later.
-Yeah, okay.

301
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,708
[horse neighing]

302
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,666
Sara! Hello.

303
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,583
Hi.

304
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,791
-Where's Felice? Do you know?
-No, I don't.

305
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,500
-You don't know?
-No.

306
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,083
-She posted a picture saying she was here.
-Yeah, she does that sometimes.

307
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,791
You know, she posts stuff
like she's somewhere

308
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,333
but she's not actually there.

309
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:54,416
With Wille?
Is she somewhere else with Wille?

310
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,583
What? I have no idea.

311
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,708
Does she talk a lot about him? Wille?

312
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:07,166
What? What are you trying to get at?

313
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Has anyone
ever told you how pretty you are?

314
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,625
What?

315
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,541
[laughs] What?

316
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,583
[laughs] What?

317
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:18,208
THE PALACE AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

[exhales]

321
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,416
[doorbell rings]

322
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:40,916
Here.

323
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:45,541
Ow! Ow! What are you doing?
This is the money for the booze.

324
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,708
-What the hell are you up to?
-What?

325
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,541
-Have you started using?
-Ow.

326
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,500
Using what? What are you talking about?

327
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,500
My medication!
You think I'm stupid? Where are they?

328
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,583
I sold them.

329
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,125
Ow.

330
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,000
-Please tell me you're not using. Huh?
-What the fuck do you care?

331
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:17,583
Damn it, Simon. Doctors
prescribe them for me. Don't you get it?

332
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:22,250
I need that shit in order to function.
They're not freaking recreational.

333
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,125
They're for my ADHD.

334
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,041
How stupid do you think I am?

335
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,125
Huh?

336
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,250
I know you'll use anything
to get high or drunk.

337
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:38,208
You couldn't even stop using
for Sara's and my sake.

338
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,000
You're so fucking pathetic.

339
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,250
[sighs]

340
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,416
[knocks softly]

341
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,458
[Alex] Crown Prince Wilhelm?

342
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,125
[grunts]

343
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,750
-Thanks.
-No problem.

344
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,750
Shall we?

345
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,666
Yeah.

346
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,166
You should have gotten a key.

347
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,083
-You don't have one?
-No.

348
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,500
[Wilhelm clears throat]

349
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:23,958
Whoa.

350
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,000
Welcome to the Society.

351
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:30,958
Thanks.

352
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,583
-Alexander, would you…
-Sure.

353
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:43,666
We have unanimously voted in favor
of offering you, Crown Prince Wilhelm…

354
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,791
the seat that was
formerly held by Prince Erik.

355
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:53,125
Now you only have
to answer one single question.

356
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:55,250
Hmm?

357
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,666
