00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,000
POOR BOYS. I PITY THEM.

00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,750
SO CLUMSY TO GET CAUGHT ON FILM.

7
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,125
I KNOW WHERE HE LIVES!

00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,291
Your Majesty, there are
no words for how sorry I am

17
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,791
that something like this
could happen at our school.

18
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,333
We're going to issue a statement--

19
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,250
You're not condemning anything
until we tell you so.

20
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:17,208
We could buy you some of that?
What do you think?

[Queen] You realize that
this will have consequences?

25
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,916
I'm sorry, Mama.

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,291
It looks like we can't cover this up.

27
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,958
We have to address the matter.

28
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,083
But we can still deny
that it is you in the video.

29
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,958
You can't really see that it is you.

30
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,458
So, this is what we'll do.

31
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,875
We'll come and pick you up on Saturday.

32
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:24,458
We'll let, um,
Rosenqvist handle the interview.

33
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,750
We'll give her
exclusive rights to the entire statement.

34
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,000
We can trust her.

35
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,916
I don't want you
to see Simon for the time being.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,250
It, uh, only sets off new rumors.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,416
We have to solve this first.

38
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,083
-[Linda] Hey, love. How'd it go?
-[sighs]

39
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, Mom. I am able to go to the shop.

40
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:01,791
Simon.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,333
We should really file a police report.

42
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,583
Mm-hmm.

43
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,291
Hey.

44
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,666
I don't think you should
go back to that school.

45
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,750
No.

46
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,625
And I think
it would be best if none of you did.

47
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:26,833
I'll call Marieberg
and see if we can change back.

48
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,916
But, Mom,
I don't want to stop going to Hillerska!

49
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,833
[in Spanish]
Think about everything he did for you.

50
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,833
[in English]
Like meeting Dad behind my back?

51
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,875
Are you gonna ruin my life
just because he's ruining his?

52
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,833
Stop being so fucking stubborn
and try to understand my situation.

53
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,875
The whole fucking world
has seen me in that video!

54
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:58,083
King Carl Gustaf XVII and XVIII
at the same time?

55
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,000
Or what?

56
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,958
How are they gonna find an heir?
I mean, they can't have kids.

57
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,000
I guess they'll have
to find a surrogate mother.

58
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,083
The thing is that they'll have
to find a super blue-blooded surrogate.

59
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,666
-No one would take that offer.
-[laughs] Well, you definitely would.

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,583
[laughs] Yeah!

61
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,583
Hey, seriously, drop it.

62
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,333
He's just been outed.

63
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,333
Yeah, but there's a lot of people who
don't even believe it's him in the video.

64
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,250
Yeah.

65
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,291
It's only us students who know
that it's Wilhelm's room on the video.

66
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,791
Remember what we saw during movie night?
When they sat next to each other?

67
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:31,791
That's right!

68
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,500
-We spoke about it.
-Yeah!

69
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,958
Everyone knows his room.

70
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,166
-Was someone outside his window?
-Well, probably.

71
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,583
Yeah, but who?

72
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,000
I mean, it could be anyone.
It's so fucking stupid.

73
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,583
-What about that tall guy?
-What, like Lukas?

74
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,666
[doorbell ringing]

75
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,125
Hello! Simon, right?

76
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,916
I'm from Today's News and
I'm writing an article and would like…

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,458
No. No. No.

78
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,083
-I'm a real reporter.
-I don't want to talk to you!

79
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,541
-I'm on your side.
-I'm calling the cops if you don't leave.

80
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,416
I'm giving you
a chance to give your version.

81
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,541
-[Sara] Hi.
-Hi.

82
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,625
How are you?

83
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,250
How's Simon?
He must be totally devastated.

84
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,250
Yeah, he feels terrible
so he's staying home today.

85
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,416
-Mom wants us to change schools.
-What?

86
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,666
She doesn't want us to continue
after everything that's happened.

87
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,333
But, wait a sec. When?

88
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,041
As soon as the term is over.

89
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,291
Hmm.

90
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,250
-[woman] This is the computer.
-[man] Okay.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,916
Hey, look.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,333
[man] Is it turned on?

93
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,833
Hey, those guys are not
from the IT support.

94
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,291
They must be here because of the video.

95
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,791
We'll have to take it with us.

96
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,916
[Felice] Have you ever seen
anyone use that one? So weird.

97
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,833
Oh, my God.

98
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,833
[knocking on window]

99
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,875
[window rattling]

100
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,958
Seriously? What the fuck is your problem?

101
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,458
Whoa. Uh…

102
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,375
We tried calling you, bro.

103
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,708
Are you gonna let us in?

104
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,250
-Yeah.
-[both] Yeah?

105
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,416
It's just total chaos.

106
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,500
Mmm.

107
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,666
It's all they talk about at school.

108
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,041
Yeah, but they're just hyping it up
because someone from Bjärstad is famous.

109
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,666
"Famous"?

110
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,416
Man, just don't bother about it.
It's just a video, bro.

111
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,000
-"Just a video"?
-Famous people make videos like that.

112
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,500
Well, not on purpose. They leak the video.

113
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,666
Like Kim Kardashian.

114
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,333
And she's doing fine now.

115
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,333
-Have you seen it?
-Which one? His or…

116
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,000
-Come on! Kim K.
-Yeah, 100%.

117
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,791
-Haven't seen it?
-I haven't seen it!

118
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,041
-[laughs]
-[Ayub] Simon, you must have seen it.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,083
-Yes.
-Have you seen it?

120
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,750
-Have you both seen it?
-Yeah.

121
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,708
Not together, but I've seen it.

122
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,958
Just drop it. This was about your video.

123
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,208
Doesn't bother me at all.
I've seen it. Absolutely. 100%.

124
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,000
-Let's go back to his video.
-Yeah. Sorry. Okay.

125
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,666
What did Wille say? Did you talk to him?

126
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,916
[Ayub] Tell us.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,416
No, I turned off the phone.

128
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,625
I can't take it anymore.

129
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,416
[Ayub] I get you.
So, what are you gonna do?

130
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm gonna have to quit.

131
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,791
-Just like that?
-And start at ours?

132
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,625
-Mmm.
-[Ayub] Hey, yay, yay!

133
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,583
The gang's back together!

134
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,208
I would love for you to come back with us,

135
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,875
but why should you
take the blame for what they've done?

136
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:35,875
Exactly.

137
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,000
Are you gonna let them
go on with their bullshit?

138
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,000
-If you quit…
-Fuck them, man.

139
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,958
-…you're the one paying for it.
-Yeah.

140
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,916
[Rosh] You can't give up now.

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,375
No, definitely not. Preach!

142
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,833
[snapping]

143
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,250
Well, we'll…

144
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,875
see you at the weekend.

145
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,958
Take care, darling.

146
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,291
WILHELM: PLEASE COME TO SCHOOL
TOMORROW. WE NEED TO TALK.

147
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:20,208
SIMON: DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE IT.
WHO DID IT? MUST BE SOMEONE AT SCHOOL.

148
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,041
WILHELM: IT'S SO FUCKING SICK.
PLEASE COME. WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

149
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,208
[knocking on door]

150
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,291
Yes?

151
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,833
I told the housemaster
that I'd bring you dinner.

152
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,583
You do know you don't need to hide?

153
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,750
And if anyone gives
you a hard time, you know,

154
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,500
just let me know,
and I'll take care of it.

155
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,083
Hey, August, um…

156
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:12,291
I'd like to apologize
for that thing with the Society.

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,500
I shouldn't have told
everyone about your money problem.

158
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,083
I know you're only trying to help me.

159
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,333
-I know I let you down.
-It's all good.

160
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay?

161
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,833
Thank you.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,541
And thanks for helping me
with my tuition fees.

163
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,458
I wish Erik was here.
He'd tell me what to do.

164
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,500
I don't know.

165
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,458
What am I supposed to do? I'm…

166
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:45,125
I think that Erik
would have wanted you to be yourself.

167
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,083
Really.

168
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,208
You know, follow your heart.

169
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,208
[dreamy electronic music playing]

170
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,500
Come on! It's just school.

171
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,791
Thanks, Sara.

172
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,416
-Hi.
-Good morning.

173
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,250
-Hey!
-Hi.

00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,958
Did you watch the game last night?

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,625
-No.
-Okay.

176
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,708
[Simon] What the hell are we gonna do?

177
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,125
[sighs]

178
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,625
They've asked me to deny
that it was me in that video.

179
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,041
Seriously?

180
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,500
Mmm.

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,708
They want me to make a statement
at the castle on Saturday.

182
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,125
But you're not going to do it, right?

183
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,208
I don't want to say anything.

184
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,958
But, Wille, everyone
can see that it's me in that video.

185
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,541
-[groans]
-What am I supposed to do?

186
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:23,458
But no matter what,
they can't dictate what you say.

187
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,708
We haven't done anything wrong.

188
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:39,958
No.

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,166
We haven't.

190
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,541
You're right. We're doing this together.

191
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,208
Sara, I'm gonna kidnap you
if you leave this school.

192
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,375
Yes, I swear to God.
If you go to Marieberg, I'm gonna…

193
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,458
[indistinct chatter]

194
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,000
[knocking on door]

195
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,250
Hi.

196
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:42,833
May I come in?

197
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,666
What do you want?

198
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,458
I know that it was you
who uploaded the video.

199
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,375
Come in.

200
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,166
Well, the police took
the computer that you used

201
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,250
and that's where
the video was uploaded from.

202
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:09,333
So you thought you'd start spreading
false rumors without having any proof?

203
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,583
Okay, so you won't mind if I tell Wilhelm

204
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,333
that I saw you
using that computer on that day?

205
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,333
Go for it.

206
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,500
Okay.

207
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,875
No, wait!

208
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,375
Why did you do it?

209
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't even know myself. It…

210
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,666
It just happened.

211
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,208
I thought you and Wilhelm were friends.

212
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,666
Yeah.

213
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:46,958
True.

214
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,416
Yeah? So why?

215
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,791
Wilhelm's has everything!

216
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,916
And he just spits on it.

217
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,416
I've tried to help him several times, but…

218
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,250
I mean, Erik took his role seriously.

219
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,250
Wille, he just doesn't care.

220
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,333
He's an embarrassment
to the whole royal family.

221
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,833
That doesn't give you the right.

222
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,000
And what about Simon?
He's completely destroyed.

223
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,875
So what do you want?

224
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,291
You're still here,
so obviously you must want something.

225
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,500
So what do you want?

226
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,666
Huh?

227
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,666
You can have whatever the hell you want.

228
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,083
What's your biggest dream?

229
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,916
To be like you.

230
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,750
To live at Hillerska,
and have a life here.

231
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,000
You mean that you…?

232
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,166
Oh.

233
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,291
That's not too hard to arrange.

234
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,916
I can get you into the Manor House.

235
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,541
The prefect and I are this close.

236
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,916
-You can even skip the line.
-I can't afford it.

237
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,666
People like you get grants.
That means everything's free.

238
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,916
I'll even help you apply.

239
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,875
And in return, you won't tell anyone.

240
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,208
Okay?

241
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,125
[indistinct chatter on TV]

242
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,000
[Linda] Sara, dinner's ready!

243
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,625
-What? Are we eating in here?
-[Linda] Yeah.

244
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,541
Can't we sit at the dinner table?

245
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,041
[in Spanish] This is cozy.

246
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,291
[Sara in English]
Can't we buy real serviettes?

247
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:41,916
[laughs]

248
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:46,666
Someone's really been inspired
by all the posh girls at the Manor House.

249
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,875
-What's so wrong with that?
-Nothing.

250
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,708
[in Spanish] You look pretty.

251
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,708
[in English] But why are you dressed up?

252
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,625
Is it a special occasion or…

253
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,291
It's nice to make an effort
and dress up for dinner.

254
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,250
I'd better go get my suit.

255
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,250
[laughs]

256
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,833
I'm applying for a grant at Hillerska,
so I can become a resident there.

257
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,750
-You'll be rid of me.
-What?

258
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,625
At least I won't be a burden to anyone.

259
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,208
And I won't have to stay
in this crappy house.

260
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,458
[Simon] What the hell
are you saying? Chill down!

261
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,833
-Mm, mm, mm.
-No?

262
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,833
Hold on.
I'll take care of this. I'll handle this.

263
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,791
[sighing]

264
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,500
Have you lost it completely?

265
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,375
She's done everything for us,
and you just piss on her!

266
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,916
-No.
-Yes!

267
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,416
No, if she had done everything for us,
she'd have protected us from Dad!

268
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,416
And his booze and drugs.

269
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,500
-That's what she tried to do.
-Trying is not enough, Simon!

270
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,291
She should've divorced him
as soon as everything started.

271
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,208
Then we would've been homeless.

272
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,375
You have to give people a chance.

273
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,833
Simon, you can't always
just give everybody a chance.

274
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,125
That's your biggest problem!

275
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,291
You're just always
trying to help everybody!

276
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:09,750
First you tried to help Dad,
then me, and now Wilhelm.

277
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,166
You keep letting people piss on you!

278
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,333
At least I don't piss on my family, Sara.

279
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,750
And I'm not trying to be someone I'm not.

280
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,791
No one likes me when I'm myself.

281
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,208
I like you when you are yourself!

282
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,791
Now you're doing it again.

283
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,125
You're trying to take care of me.

284
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,750
I'm trying to be your friend again,

285
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,333
because I need you.

286
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:16,833
Okay.

287
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,833
What am I supposed to wear?

288
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,500
Stop it.

289
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,625
I can't be dressed like this
if you're dressed like that.

290
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,041
I just look stupid.

291
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,500
No, you don't.

292
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,583
I'm the one who looks stupid.

293
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,291
You're beautiful.

294
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,208
So are you.

295
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,833
[Madison] Stop playing detective.
Let's watch a movie instead.

296
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:03,208
I'm just trying to find something,
just something, anything at all

297
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,375
that might help them
catch the one who did it.

298
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,666
Why?

299
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,500
Because if everything calms down,

300
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,208
then Sara might not have to change school.

301
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,625
And I want to help Wilhelm.

302
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,250
The police will figure it out.

303
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:29,208
WILHELM: GOING HOME TOMORROW.
WILL YOU COME AND SAY GOODBYE?

304
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,125
SIMON: OF COURSE

305
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,166
Do they want you to stop seeing me?

306
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,125
Yeah, I'm sure they do.

307
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,583
But I don't want to.

308
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,083
Will you tell them that?

309
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,000
I will. I want to be with you.

310
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:15,166
You're right.
They can't force me to make the statement.

311
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,875
I'm gonna talk to my mom.

312
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,666
She has to understand.

313
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,750
Fuck! Fuck! They'll be here in a minute.

314
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,041
How are you feeling?

315
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,000
It feels like I'm gonna throw up.

316
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll call you later.

317
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,666
You'll do just fine.

318
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,083
You're brave.

319
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,750
Thank you for
not letting me go through this alone.

320
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,625
Hi. I thought…

321
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,958
I wanted us to have a few minutes alone.

322
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,541
[clears throat] How do you do?

323
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,291
Pleasure.

324
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,916
Your, um… Majesty.

325
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,125
Um, see ya.

326
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,458
Goodbye.

327
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,708
What?

328
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:05,833
What if…

329
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,291
Why can't I just have
a relationship with him?

330
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,458
And not say anything.

331
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,708
Just live a normal life.

332
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,208
You're the Crown Prince.

333
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,125
And that's a privilege, not a punishment.

334
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,166
Yes, but I didn't ask for this!

335
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,083
Well, nobody has ever,
ever asked for this!

336
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:33,250
You're the only one who can
take over the throne after Erik.

337
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,333
Don't you understand that?

338
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,583
You're so young.

339
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:49,291
When you're young, love feels like
the most important thing in the world.

340
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,791
When I was your age,

341
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,833
I too had an unfortunate romance.

342
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,208
That was before I met your father.

343
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,958
What I mean is,

344
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,500
is it worth it?

345
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:12,083
If you feel that the attention you've
been getting so far is unacceptable,

346
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:16,125
it's nothing compared to what
you will endure for the rest of your life.

347
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,583
We have a chance to cover this up.

348
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,791
I urge you to take that chance.

349
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,416
