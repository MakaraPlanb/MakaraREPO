00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,625
Thanks.

180
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,125
-[August] Can you guys get the boat?
-[boy] Sure.

181
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,208
[August] Good. Thanks.

182
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,833
The other one too.

183
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:07,833
Thanks.

184
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,833
Looking good, Simon.

185
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:29,875
Thanks.

186
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,083
[Wilhelm] Don't worry about balance.
You'll get the hang of it.

187
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,333
However, you should
think about keeping your strokes

188
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,083
as close to the surface as possible

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,750
so as to not waste too much energy.

190
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,708
-But that's just…
-So you still remember then?

191
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,333
[exhales] Yeah.

192
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,666
Well… [clears throat]

193
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,541
Hey, socialist boy!
You could become a great coxswain.

194
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,916
It's well-suited for smaller people.

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You know?

196
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,791
[chuckles]

197
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,458
Come on.

198
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,375
[in Spanish] No. No, it's okay.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,916
[in English] Hi.

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,041
-Where have you been?
-Sorry, I had a…

201
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,750
I had rowing practice.

202
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,666
[laughs]

203
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,583
-Wait, what? Rowing?
-Yeah.

204
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,916
-What the fuck is rowing?
-It's a sport.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,041
-Rowing isn't a sport.
-[Simon] Yes, it is.

206
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,833
Football is a sport.

207
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,666
-So what do you do?
-Well, I mean, you row.

208
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,208
- Like you do at camp.
-[laughs] Come on!

209
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,250
Well, you know.

210
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,208
It's something new. Something fresh.

211
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,625
-Seriously, who are you?
-What?

212
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,583
[laughs]

213
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,166
-I mean, seriously? Stop.
-What?

214
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,041
-So boring.
-[Simon] What?

215
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,208
You're too funny.

216
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,458
[Simon] I'm doing it to get better grades.

217
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,500
-To get extra points.
-Do you have to have good grades?

218
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,666
Yeah, of course you wanna have good grades

219
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,541
if you want to get somewhere. I think.

220
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,833
Like, where to?

221
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,791
Well, I mean, I…

222
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:13,166
I like Bjärstad,
but I don't want to live here forever.

223
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,375
You know?

224
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:17,958
What?

225
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,750
Are you playing?

226
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:29,791
Yeah.

227
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,458
Uh, there's pizza left if you want some.

228
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,500
Bon appétit.

229
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,208
Thanks.

230
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,916
[laughs] What are you doing?

231
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,958
Coming to see the game tomorrow?

232
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,125
Yeah, I'm really gonna try to make it.

233
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,291
Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

234
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,958
[dreamy electronic music playing]

235
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,583
[clicks tongue]

236
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,333
[door opens]

237
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,541
Oh, shit! Sorry!

238
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,958
I didn't see anything. I…

239
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,416
I just wanted to see where you were.
We have morning practice.

240
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,541
You can't just lie here jerking off.

241
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,416
I was not jerking off.

242
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,041
-Give it to me.
-No.

243
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,916
-Now get up.
-What do you want it for?

244
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,291
Seriously?

245
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:13,041
Just don't use the school's Wi-Fi
for porn surfing. Could be embarrassing.

246
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,666
[cell phone ringing]

247
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,666
-[Erik] Well, hello there!
-Hey, man. What's up?

248
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,541
-How are you?
-Well, um, I'm fine.

249
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,583
I'm just trying to tell your brother…

250
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,791
Wille here, that he might
wanna improve his strength

251
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,083
to make the rowing team.

252
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,916
-August…
-All right?

253
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,958
And how's that going?

254
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,583
To be honest, I don't think he has
the same drive that you and I have.

255
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,250
-He's a bit… lazy.
-Really, August? Come on.

256
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,416
-He was still sleeping when I walked in.
-Was he?

257
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,708
But we'll fix that, right?

258
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,250
Won't we? Hmm?

259
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:54,375
Well, I should be going.
But nice talking to you, as always.

260
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,708
-[Erik] See you.
-Sure.

261
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,291
And, hey, Wille, um…

262
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:01,000
make sure you're done jerking off
and ready to go at 0600 tomorrow. Okay?

263
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,333
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

264
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,166
Good.

265
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,708
Hi, Wilhelm.

266
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,666
[door shuts]

267
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,500
[Wilhelm sighs] Hi, Erik.

268
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,583
-How's it going?
-Ugh!

269
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,791
August is really
getting on my nerves! Seriously.

270
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,833
Is he always like this?

271
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,583
Yeah, he's always been like that.
A bit… A bit intense.

272
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,250
But just try to understand him.

273
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,166
Intense? He's fucking hysterical.

274
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,000
Nobody else cares about these things.

275
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,458
Yeah, but he's had it rough.

276
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,666
That school is like his entire life.

277
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,166
Don't you not remember
that his mom sent him there

278
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,833
after his dad killed himself?

279
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,416
What? No.

280
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,041
[clamoring outside]

281
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,208
I knew he was dead, but not that he…

282
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,041
killed himself.

283
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,750
-Maybe you were just too young.
-What do you mean "too young?"

284
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,000
Maybe somebody
forgot to tell me, as usual.

285
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,791
Can we talk later?
I have to go to practice now.

286
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,250
Apparently, I'm a bit too lazy, but…

287
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,250
I'll call you after practice. Okay?

288
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,875
-Of course. Bye.
-Great, bye.

289
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,000
Sorry.

290
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,041
Check you out.

291
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,208
Okay. Let's go.

292
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,166
[August]
Hold that position! You can do it!

293
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,500
-[boys groaning]
-[Wilhelm pants]

294
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,541
Asses in the air, Nisse!

295
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,541
[boys grunt]

296
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:52,125
Three, two, one…
and time for a break! Well done!

297
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,625
Hey…

298
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,666
Um…

299
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,500
The money for…

300
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,500
for all the booze.

301
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,083
Damn it. Sorry. Shit.
I completely forgot. It wasn't…

302
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,958
No, it's cool. I'll cover it for now.

303
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,958
But if you text me the amount,
I can just transfer it.

304
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,375
Yeah.

305
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,000
Good.

306
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,375
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

307
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,333
Vincent?

308
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:39,791
Vincent?

309
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,541
-Is Vincent here?
-Uh, no.

310
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,125
-Vincent?
-What's up?

311
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,708
[August sighs]

312
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,333
Can you get me more?

313
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,083
What, already?

314
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,208
Seriously, how much are you taking?

315
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,250
Can you do it or not?

316
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,750
No, sorry, I can't.

317
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,291
I've already changed
psychiatrists several times.

318
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,416
I don't have any left.

319
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,416
So I…

320
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,416
I ordered…

321
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,458
I ordered like four weeks ago,
but it got stuck at customs.

322
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,791
Come on, seriously.

323
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,333
You know how
fucking important this year is for me.

324
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,666
I have to bring my A game.

325
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,958
Take it easy. Calm down.

326
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,500
Go to the counselor
and start your own assessment.

327
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,250
I can't keep up with this pace.

328
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,375
That Birkenstock socialist?

329
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,875
You know I don't even have ADHD.

330
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,000
It'll never work.

331
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,833
Well…

332
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,583
Hmm. There.

333
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,458
We can use that one again.

334
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,125
Well…

335
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,000
-Hmm.
-Yeah…

336
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,583
Uh…

337
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,500
Want some water?

338
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,291
Uh, yeah.

339
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,250
-Sure.
-Yes.

340
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,833
I think I have ADHD.

341
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,833
What? ADHD? Why do you think that?

342
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,083
I have problems concentrating. You know?

343
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,666
I see.

344
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,666
Any special reason
why you find it hard to focus?

345
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,916
-There you go.
-Thanks.

346
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,875
Well, you know,
sometimes the mind's just spinning.

347
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,125
-I'm sure you know how it is.
-[chuckles]

348
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,291
Sure, do you, uh… [groans]

349
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,625
Do you have trouble sleeping?

350
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,541
Yeah.

351
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,250
-Is your heart racing? Yes?
-Mmm.

352
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,333
-Boom, boom, boom.
-Exactly. Yeah.

353
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,875
And, um… are you dizzy?

354
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,125
-[exhales]
-Headache?

355
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,166
-A massive weight on your chest?
-Mmm.

all of that,
that is just symptoms of stress.

358
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,666
And stress is quite common here at school.

359

Especially during the last year.

360
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,833

and the team captain as well.

-Yeah, but it's not pressure.
-Okay. So what do you think it is?

we can do an assessment. No problem.

Well, you see,
an assessment takes weeks to do.

370
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:46,541
And we need to do in-depth interviews
with people who know you,

371
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,958
and have known you since you were a kid.

372

373
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,000

to have grasped what I'm trying to say.

00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,458
Whoa!

528
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:41,875
Alexander?

529
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:44,708
Thanks.

530
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:49,500
[door creaks softly]

531
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:51,500
[August] I fold.

532
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,375
-[Nils] I raise you ten.
-[August] Shit.

533
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:55,750
[Nils] Okay, now you deal.

534
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,125
[Nils sighs] I've got a shitty hand.

535
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,541
[August chuckles]

536
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,291
Was it educational?

537
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,208
Hi. Sorry, I was feeling a bit better.

538
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:20,333
So I thought it was okay
that I hung out with some friends.

539
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,833
I asked if it was educational.

540
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,166
Your socialist safari.

541
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:33,583
You gotta understand
that I can't just let this slide.

542
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:36,458
You left the school's premises
without asking permission.

543
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,708
We all need permission.

544
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:45,583
You're replacing Alexander
at dinner duty for the rest of the week.

545
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,208
-Okay.
-An apology might be in order.

546
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,458
-Right?
-Yeah, sorry.

547
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,666
What'd you say?

548
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,750
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Okay.

550
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,291
Good.

551
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,250
-May I…?
-No, you know what?

552
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:07,833
You better be damn careful
what company you keep. Okay?

553
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,958
Especially if they
use you to get some views.

554
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:15,375
[boys cheering on phone]

555
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,625
[whistle blowing]

556
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,166
[cheering]

557
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,833
You know how things went last time.

558
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,125
Let's go, Bjärstad! Let's go!

559
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:24,000
Hmm?

560
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,833
[door opens]

561
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,333
-[Simon] Hi.
-[Sara] Hi.

562
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,500
You missed dinner.

563
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,916
Yeah. [chuckles]

564
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,583
I, uh… [clears throat]

565
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,000
I lost track of time.

566
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,125
You lost track of time?

567
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:46,666
How's that possible?
You can just check your watch.

568
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,791
[laughs]

569
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,208
Ah. Well…

570
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,000
[exhales]

571
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,291
I was just showing
Wilhelm around Bjärstad, that's all.

572
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,041
-Wilhelm?
-Mmm.

573
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:05,083
Weren't you the one who said that you, uh,

574
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,333
can't be friends
with anyone at the school?

575
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,416
Yeah, but people can change.

576
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,541
Isn't that the thing
about the Royal Family?

577
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,791
That they never change?

578
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,625
-Hmm.
-[cell phone vibrates]

579
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:28,541
WILHELM:
CAN YOU DELETE THE STORY SHOWING ME?

580
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,166
WILHELM: SORRY…

581
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,583
ETIQUETTE

582
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,625
[Madison] Is it too hot?

583
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:51,041
[Felice] No, it's not too hot.
It's okay. It just feels warm.

584
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,625
- I don't wanna sound like an idiot.
-[Felice yelps]

585
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:54,833
[chuckles]

586
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:56,583
All right.

587
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,708
It feels like August just wants to
ruin my chances to get close to Wilhelm.

588
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,375
Of course he does.

589
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,125
Just make a move on Wilhelm
and show him what you want.

590
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,291
Stop it.

591
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,916
August, can I have a word with you?

592
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,958
I always have time for you, Headmistress.

593
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:26,750
-Hi.
-Hello.

594
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,541
I just wanted
to ask you about your tuition fee.

595
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:35,708
-[scoffs nervously] I don't understand.
-Well, it hasn't been paid.

596
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,000
And I haven't
been able to reach your mother.

597
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:43,166
That's odd.

598
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,583
You know what? She's traveling.

599
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,666
-Yeah, of course, just as I suspected.
-That's why.

600
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,541
But I'll ask her to contact you.

601
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,791
Good. Take care now.

602
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,750
[dreamy electronic music playing]

603
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,833
-Good day, August.
-Hello, miss.

604
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:24,208
I have to…

605
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,541
You've got ADHD, right?

606
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,291
Uh… yeah.

607
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,208
Cool.

608
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,583
Actually, I've just begun my assessment.

609
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:47,625
Hmm?

610
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,875
Well…

611
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:55,916
So you're not on any kind
of medication or anything?

612
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:57,666
I am.

613
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,041
-Okay.
-[Sara] Vyvanse, 50mg.

614
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,375
[August] Right.

615
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,958
This is gonna sound really weird but…

616
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:11,041
would you be down with selling me some?

617
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,083
-[Sara] That's illegal.
-[August] Yeah…

618
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,208
[Sara] Why would I do something illegal?

619
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:21,958
-I thought that since Simon hooked us up…
-[clears throat]

620
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,000
We need to talk
about the rowing team. Now.

621
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,083
We can go outside
if you want to. If that's okay.

622
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,166
[August] Fine.

623
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,041
[Simon]
I don't want you to talking to her.

624
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:37,666
Sorry.

625
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,458
But, um, what about your contact?

626
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,458
-Can I buy some from him?
-No!

627
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,625
Who do you take me for?
I just want my fucking money.

628
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,333
How about I double what I owe you,
if you get me the pills?

629
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:57,875
Come on.

630
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,291
It's a great deal.

631
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,333
Good.

632
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
[water boiling]

633
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:15,708
Why don't you bring Sara next time?
It would be great to see you both.

634
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,875
Um, not sure that's a good idea.

635
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,375
This place looks nice.

636
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,541
[plays note on keyboard]

637
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:25,250
You wanna stay a while and jam?

638
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:30,250
Well, the thing is…

639
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,916
I can't really stay that long.

640
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,416
[faint yelling]

641
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,500
Hey, uh…

642
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,208
about the money…

643
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,958
for the booze for your friends.

644
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,750
Right. I'm sorry.

645
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:46,875
Damn. It's on its way.

646
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:49,833
I promise.

647
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,125
But still…

648
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,875
at least you can stay for a cup of coffee?

649
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:57,416
Yeah.

650
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:04,000
-Hey, Simon…
-Uh-huh?

651
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:06,166
We should go to a concert again sometime.

652
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:07,666
Yeah.

653
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,166
Like when you were a kid.

654
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,208
Remember when you, me and Sara went
to see the Lee "Scratch" Perry concert?

655
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:19,791
Yeah, that's right.

656
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:27,000
-Did you remember the spoons, Dad?
-Uh… yeah.

657
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,250
[grunting]

658
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,291
[blows whistle]

659
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,333
Rotate!

660
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,666
[panting]

661
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:07,666
What the fuck!

662
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,500
When do I get my money?

663
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,833
-[blows whistle]
-Gather round!

664
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,958
Simon, as you probably
all know, is a non-border.

665
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,083
A bona fide Bjärstad local.

666
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:32,791
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.
He's had to fight hard to get here.

667
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:37,166
Probably more than
any of you guys ever have had to fight.

668
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,750
That's quite remarkable.

669
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,791
We should all learn from Simon.

670
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,625
He has fought his way up.
Now he's here, among us.

671
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,875
Among the possibilities.

672
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:53,541
Simon is…

673
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,541
the class journey personified.

674
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,625
I'm proud of you.

675
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,250
[kisses]

676
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,375
[snorts]

677
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:14,875
What looking at? Huh? Get back to work!

678
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:19,916
What the hell was that?

679
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:33,458
[in Spanish]
Call me when you want to be picked up.

680
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:34,875
-Hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

681
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:36,291
-[Simon] Okay.
-Thanks, Mom.

682
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,708
-Bye.
-Wait, where's my phone?

683
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,458
[in Spanish] Here it is.

684
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,541
[in English] It's great that you're
getting invited to things like this.

685
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,791
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

686
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,666
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

687
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,125
-Okay.
-[kisses]

688
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,916
-[in Spanish] See you later.
-Bye.

689
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,791
-Have fun.
-Thanks.

690
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:05,333
Don't you think it's weird
Felice invited us to come?

691
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,250
I think she likes me.

692
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:12,500
But honestly, I don't know
what I should talk to her about,

693
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:13,875
if it's not about Rousseau.

694
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,000
[Simon laughs]

695
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:18,333
-I'm sure it'll be fine.
-Yeah.

696
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,166
Cal?

697
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:24,708
Something's not right, I think
we should head back to the road.

698
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,791
[man on screen]
This is nuts! This is fucking nuts! Becky!

699
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:29,500
Becky!

700
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:30,625
[grass rustling]

701
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,083
Becky!

702
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:36,750
Beck!

703
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,000
Beck!

704
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,333
[man breathing heavily]

00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,208
-[August] You call this a scary movie?
-[girl] Shut up.

708
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:57,291
[August] Come on,
you can't be scared for real, it's…

709
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,041
Could you stop ruining the film?

710
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,458
Nobody asked you to come.
Feel free to leave if you want.

711
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:04,333
-Stella, stop being so uptight.
-Just be quiet!

712
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,916
[man] I just slipped!

713

[man panting on screen]

715
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:30,541
[man] I'm getting a little
freaked out here. What are we gonna do?

716
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,625
[woman] We're gonna get out of here.

717
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,000
We just need to keep our heads.

718
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:38,125
What about the kid?

719
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,666
This is about us now.

720

[man] Beck!

721
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:03,416
Just stay where you are, okay? Don't move.

722
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,750
Save your voice.

-Hi.
-[clears throat]

Are you… are you okay?

Yeah.

730
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:21,458
It got so damn hot in there,
I thought I'd get some fresh air.

731
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,416
Now my toe is cramping up as well.

732
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,833
[laughs]

733
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:30,375

Well, I'm not…

738
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,166
I'm not… Stop! Wait, wait, wait!

739
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,916
[sighs]

740
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,583
[sighs] Oh, fuck.

741
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:42,458
I'm not… Sorry. I'm not…

742
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:47,875
