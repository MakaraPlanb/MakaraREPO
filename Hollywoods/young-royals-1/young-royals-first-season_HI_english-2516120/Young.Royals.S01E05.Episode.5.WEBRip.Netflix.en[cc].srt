She wants me to wear
her old dress at Lucia.

a solution so he won't be expelled.

Or else he'll start telling on us.

Are you kidding me? He can't just…

We all understand that you are in

something out before that.

he's the one who brought
the drugs in to begin with.

328
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,958
So, it only makes sense, right?

329

Absolutely.

330

Why? Are you trying
to be best friends with August?

350
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,000
It's because he owes me money.

-August owes you money?
-Yes.

352
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,583
-But how come?
-Well, because I sold him booze.

353
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,125
It was for your initiation.

354

But, apparently, he's fucking broke.

Is August broke?

356
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,333
Or maybe he lied about that too.
What do I know?

we should blame it all on you.

what I wanted to talk to you about.

It's about your tuition fee.

Here's the problem,

412
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,375

Well, we have made a joint decision

416
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,416
that means you can't return
to school after the Christmas break.

[Vincent] What's the status of Alexander?

429
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,916
[August] Alexander's meeting is on Monday.

430
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,083
Our task is to give him a good alibi

431
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,666
and back Alexander's story.

432
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:44,458
We are gonna say
that Simon tried to sell to us first

433
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:47,375
and then he got frustrated
when none of us wanted to buy anything.

434
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,916
And then Simon is done.

435
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,500
He'll get thrown out.

436
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,791
[August] Exactly. And Alexander stays.

437
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,208
I say we blame Alexander.

438
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,916
We'll say he tried to sell us drugs,

439
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,583
but that we refused.

440
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,875
At that point,
it won't matter what he says.

441
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,750
We are eight against one.
And he's the one they caught with drugs.

442
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,041
-Why not Simon?
-Because this is easier.

443
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,416
Alexander will be fine.

444
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,375
He'll end up
at some school in Switzerland.

445
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,666
The thing is, though…

446
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,333

450

-[laughs nervously] What?
-You can't pay your tuition fees.

451

No matter what happens,
you won't be here after Christmas.

No.

454

that you don't want to sell Årnäs.

[Vincent] Uh, it's like this.

466
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:06,416
I think it's important
that you as principal know that Alexander…

467

Alexander, the first-year,
offered me drugs.

[boy] He was really persistent,
and kind of initiated everything.

469
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:17,916
He told me he got hold
of the drugs during a weekend at home.

470
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,291
He probably thought
that it'd make him cool.

Obviously, I refused.
I have no interest in such things.

He was really pushy and aggressive.

473
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:29,458
I assume that he thought
that it would make him popular.

474
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,958

I'm not into that.

informed the principal immediately.
