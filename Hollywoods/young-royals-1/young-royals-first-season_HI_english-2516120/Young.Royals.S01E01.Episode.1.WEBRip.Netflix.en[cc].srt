[Erik] I'll meet you by the car! Oh!

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,416
It didn't occur to you they might search
the place before the prince arrived?

176
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,083
It's impossible to get anything in.

177
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,208
The secret police
have the staff terrified.

178
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,625
I had to have a bloody medical certificate
to bring my medication.

179
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,166
Fucking unbelievable.
I promised Erik I'd take care of Wille.

180
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,916
And I want to give him
the wildest initiation ever.

181
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:55,458
Do we want the future king to remember
us as the legends of the decade,

182
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,166
or as losers who couldn't even
make sure the prince got a fucking toast?

183
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,250
-Huh?
-[footsteps approaching]

184
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,875
What about him, the non-boarder?

185
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,125
Good voice, man.

186
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,750
He's bound to know
someone who makes moonshine.

187
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,958
Remember when
he came up to us the first week…

188
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,166
-Stop it.
-…and was like, "What's up?"

189
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,458
Makes me puke.

190
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,333
-As if we have anything in common.
-[laughs]

191
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,291
Yuck.

192
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,333
[knocks]

193
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,708
[Erik gasps] Wow, I'm so jealous.

194
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,041
I had to share a room
until the third year.

195
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,750
I can't take three years here, Erik.

196
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,666
[scoffs]

197
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,708
Do what the first years do
and what the third-years tell you.

198
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,166
[Wilhelm] You mean
do what August tells me?

199
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,666
He's so annoying.

200
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,791
August is family.
You can trust August, he's like a brother.

201
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,291
Who the hell can live like this
for three fucking years?

202
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,625
It's not about you.

203
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,750
Everything you do
reflects back on our family.

204
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,250
It's time to stop being so selfish.

205
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,250
It's not that hard. You have to
be able to keep up appearances.

206
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,416
[knocking on door]

207
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,541
We'll be seeing each other soon.

208
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,666
-Wait. Do you really have to go now?
-Yes, I have to go now.

209
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,833
-Why? No, don't leave me.
-[Erik] Come on…

210
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,500
-Do you really?
-I have to go. No. I really…

211
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,000
[muffled grunting]

212
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,500
-[Wilhelm] Wait. Erik.
-[Erik] No, no, no. That's enough. Stop.

213
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,333
Okay, Wilhelm. That's enough. I gotta go.

214
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,375
The faster you adapt,
the easier your life will be.

215
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,458
Mmm.

216
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,666
[Wilhelm] Say hi to Mom and Dad for me.

217
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,041
[door closes]

218
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,958
[students chattering]

219
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,000
Hey, you, socialist guy!

220
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,000
Simon.

221
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,666
-Huh?
-My name's Simon.

222
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,500
-Simon? August. A pleasure.
-Is this some kind of prank?

223
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,208
No, I just wanted to say hi.
I don't believe we've met.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,541
Okay. I've been going here
for over a month, but sure.

225
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:24,083
I need your help with something.
You must know someone who sells booze?

226
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,458
Don't you have a local booze dealer?
My regular contact is out of town.

227
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,458
How do you get booze for your parties?

228
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,875
You think everybody
who doesn't live at school is a dealer?

229
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,166
We're gonna have
an initiation party for Wilhelm.

230
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,958
So if you can fix me up with a contact
who can sell us booze…

231
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,250
I might make
an extreme exception and invite you.

232
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,583
It's very rare
for a first-year to get invited.

233
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,000
People like you there, with us…

234
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,625
Wouldn't that be fun? Huh?

235
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,250
So you'll hook me up? Huh?

236
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,208
[neighing loudly]

237
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,166
[instructor] Calm down, girls.
Relax your hands.

238
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,208
You're making him nervous when you start.

239
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,083
[instructor]
Then you'll have to sit this lesson out.

240
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,458
Sara, can you help Felice?

241
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,708
-Very good.
-[Sara] Hey.

242
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,041
-Come on. There you go.
-[instructor] Keep an even stride.

243
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,666
[Sara] Okay? Yeah. That's it.

244
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,625
Good.

245
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,541
[instructor] Keep an even stride.

246
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,166
-Be prepared before you gallop.
-That's a good boy.

247
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,125
[instructor] Hey, hey, hey. Be careful!

248
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,208
-Very good. Steady. Very good indeed.
-[Sara clicks tongue]

249
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,125
-[clicks tongue]
-[instructor] Good.

250
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,000
Straight backs.

251
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,041
Lower your shoulders, please.

252
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,291
Hi.

253
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,416
That's it.

254
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,250
I can groom my own horse, thanks.

255
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,333
It's no problem. I like doing it.

256
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,291
[exasperated] I'll do it.

257
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,708
[horse nickers]

258
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,875
Would you like me to pick out the hooves?

259
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,916
Yeah, they must've gotten really dirty
after five minutes in the riding hall.

260
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:28,958
I said no.

261
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,166
-[Simon] Sara?
-Uh, I'm almost done.

262
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,666
You can go.

263
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,791
[horse nickers]

264
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,875
Um, would you like me
to ride him before or after school?

265
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,208
Ugh. Go away.

266
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,000
Bye then.

267
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,750
She shouldn't talk to you like that.

268
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,250
It wasn't about me.

269
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,625
She still shouldn't.

270
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I don't care.

271
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,000
I get to ride and help out
as much as I want to.

272
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,000
It's perfect.

273
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,875
I just don't want you
to be treated badly again.

274
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,833
I like it better here than Marieberg.

275
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,000
-At least no one picks on me.
-[bus engine revs]

276
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,375
I refuse to redo a grade
just because I'm afraid to go to school.

277
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,500
Promise to tell me
if something is wrong. Hi.

278
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,541
I'm used to no one liking me.

279
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,916
You don't have to go there.
I'll take care of myself.

280
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,125
[dreamy electronic music playing]

281
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,375
Hey, Simme! What's up?

282
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,958
Do they force you
to wear that uniform every day?

283
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,541
No, it's just because
Prince Wilhelm started school today.

284
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,333
-Ooh, Prince Wilhelm. Your Majesty!
-[laughs]

285
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,083
-He seems like a bit of a loser?
-I don't know.

286
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,958
-Have you seen the gif of the fight?
-No.

287
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,250
Let me show you.

288
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,125
[all laugh]

289
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,416
Oh, shit.

290
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,416
[shower running]

291
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,625
[gasps]

292
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,708
-[girl yelps]
-[shower stops]

293
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,375
How insane is it that
this place costs like $20,000 a year,

294
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,750
and yet, the showers
run cold after two seconds?

295
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,250
I guess we should be thankful
that we don't have to share like the rest.

296
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,291
Do you think the prince shares?

297
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,083
Do you think royal dick
is different than regular?

298
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,458
-Ew, Maddie!
-I'm not the one watching porn.

299
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,708
I wasn't.

300
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,875
Oh, my God, Felice,
you have to stop stalking him.

301
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,041
Why are you even so obsessed with him?

302
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,291
You don't need him.
You're from, like, the richest family--

303
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,666
Because he's royalty.

304
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,458
Okay, but if it's about being royal,
why don't you just hook up with August?

305
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,625
He's obviously into you,
and they're like cousins, right?

306
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,583
No, second cousins.

307
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,833
First of all, I have to be a bit strategic

308
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,500
when you're gonna study
with the same people for three years

309
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,458
or else you'll be labeled a slut.

310
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,375
Secondly, August isn't
part of the Royal Family

311
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,208
in the same way as Wilhelm.

312
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,166
Even if he's technically
from the same family.

313
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,416
I don't get it.

314
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, August's children
won't become princes and princesses.

315
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,791
All right.

316
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,125
-You're not having dinner?
-I'm not hungry.

317
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,375
Okay, see you later.

318
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,541
[door shuts]

319
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,583
WONDERFUL DAY IN THE STABLES

320
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,000
OMG HOW GORGEOUS!?

321
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,208
CRYING!

322
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,458
I'LL DIE FOR YOU

323
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,208
MOMMY'S CUTE HORSE GIRL!

324
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,666
FELICE!! DREAM LIFE!

325
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,208
-Put the fork on the left hand side.
-Okay.

326
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,666
-[Simon] Did you buy ketchup?
-Yes.

327
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,250
-[Sara] The knife should face the plate.
-[boy] Like this?

328
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,333
Gracias.

329
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,166
[sighs]

330
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,500
Here you go. I'm fucking starving.

331
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,875
Ooh, yeah.

332
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,583
-[woman] How's your mother, Ayub?
-[Ayub] She's fine. She sends her love.

333
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,041
[in Spanish] How was work?

334
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,416
[Linda] It was fine, dear. How was school?

335
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,375
-[in English] It was good.
-Yeah?

336
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,041
[chomping loudly]

337
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,541
-Simon, stop it.
-Mmm.

338
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,083
-Huh?
-It's nasty.

339
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,208
-I forgot to buy napkins.
-[Simon mock chewing]

340
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,291
Come on. Stop it! It's disgusting!

341
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,875
[in Spanish] Please, Simon.

342
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,166
[in English] Mommy,
can you sit up straight?

343
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,958
Let's try to have some table manners.

344
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,208
[Simon] Want some ketchup?

345
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,666
[Ayub] Yeah, okay.

346
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,250
[boys laughing]

347
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,708
-How are things in the stable?
-Good. I like it.

348
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:24,208
How are the girls? Any new friends?

349
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,416
Mom, it's not just girls,
there's boys too.

350
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,416
Of course.

351
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,750
And no, no new friends. Not really.

352
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:35,625
Oh, that reminds me,
I need some new riding britches.

353
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:39,166
[in Spanish] What about
the ones we bought, the ones you have?

354
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,375
[in English] They're tearing apart.

355
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,333
That's what happens
when you buy the cheap ones.

356
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,000
-[sighs]
-They don't last long.

357
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,208
[in Spanish] It's ridiculous to spend
so much on expensive clothes

358
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,375
just to impress people at school.

359
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,208
[in English] But that's not the point.

360
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,750
They're tearing
on the inside leg. I can't use them.

361
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,375
[Simon] You've become such a snob.

362
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,000
[in Spanish] That's not what I meant.

363
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,416
[Sara in English] Shut up, Simon.

364
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,916
Plus, they cared more about
that stuff at Marieberg than Hillerska.

365
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,958
-They were more diverse there.
-What's that got to do with anything?

366
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,625
A diverse bunch of losers,
who'll never amount to anything.

367
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,250
-What the hell are you saying? Calm down.
-Ugh!

368
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,541
[Sara] Stop nagging me. I just want
to go to school in peace and quiet.

369
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,041
-I don't need any friends. Understand?
-[dishes clatter]

370
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,541
[door slams]

371
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,875
Um, we were invited to a party.

372
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,541
-Were you?
-Mm.

373
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,875
Is it organized by the school?

374
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,291
Yeah, but the third-years are fixing it.

375
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,000
First-years aren't invited,
but they invited us.

376
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,833
-Wow, that's cool.
-Mm-hmm.

377
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,041
-So things are better than she says?
-Yeah.

378
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,583
[whispering]
The prince's initiation is tomorrow.

379
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,791
It's gonna be wild.

380
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,541
-A lot of people?
-Yeah, I think so. Quiet. He's coming.

381
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,041
Hi.

382
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,541
-Hi.
-Can I sit with you?

383
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,333
Sorry, but first-years sit down there.

384
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,041
Okay.

385
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,125
-Hi.
-Hello.

386
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,166
How, uh, how do meals work here?

387
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,708
Well, we're waiting for Housemaster.

388
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,750
Then the third-years get served,
then the second-years, and finally us.

389
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,458
And then, after dinner?

390
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,041
Then we have something we call "workies."

391
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,125
And after that we have free time,

392
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,041
where we can play games
or work out if we want to.

393
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,250
It's usually boring as hell.

394
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,458
Yeah, it's totally boring.

395
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,541
Sounded pretty sweet to me.

396
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:57,291
-Yeah, agreed. It's pretty nice.
-It's awesome to just chill out.

397
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,125
I was kidding.

398
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,083
[laughs] Yeah, so were we.

399
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,333
You are allowed
your own opinions. It's cool.

400
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,458
[door closes]

401
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,125
Good evening, gentlemen.

402
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,041
-[all] Good evening, Housemaster.
-[mumbles, clears throat]

403
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,708
[housemaster] As you've noticed,

404
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:20,416
we have a new housemate
at Forest Ridge House.

405
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,458
Let's all make sure
the prince feels extra welcome.

406
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,291
Hmm?

407
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,000
Dear Lord, bless the food on our table,

408
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,833
in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

409
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,583
-[all] Amen.
-Amen.

410
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,083
Um…

411
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:46,833
Did Micke buy
the booze for you at Midsummer?

412
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:48,333
[Ayub] Uh…

413
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,041
sorry, bro.

414
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,500
We were gonna buy it from
Stoffe's brother, but he went to Magaluf.

415
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,791
-Mm-hmm.
-Why do you ask?

416
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,541
Well, there was, um…

417
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:04,208
Some guy at school asked me if
I could get booze for an initiation party.

418
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,375
The one you got invited to?

419
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,916
We're not exactly invited,

420
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,750
but if I can get the booze,
maybe I can bring Sara.

421
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,875
She needs some fun.

422
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,833
All right, bro, but stay away from Micke.

423
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,208
Every time you see your dad

424
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,916
you get all depressed.

425
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,500
[man on game] Oh, crap! Are you okay?

426
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:39,625
WILHELM: PLEASE MOM, LET ME COME HOME.

427
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:42,375
MOM:
YOU WILL FEEL BETTER SOON

428
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,458
-Good morning. It's ten past seven
-[boy] Okay, thanks.

429
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:12,375
Thank you.

430
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:16,875
[school bell rings]

431
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:17,791
[yells loudly]

432
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:21,250
So you're all agree that
murder is at the top of the list,

433
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,166
followed by child abuse and rape.

434
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,916
But if we put two less sensitive issues
against each other, then what?

435
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,625
Hmm? Walter?

436
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,625
Well, regarding tax evasion,
you've earned a lot of money

437
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:39,333
and at least contributed
to society by creating new jobs and so on.

438
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:41,166
Okay. Mm. Stella?

439
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:46,000
Welfare scammers give nothing back.
They just take, so that's worse.

440
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:46,916
[teacher] Henry?

441
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
If you were to lower the taxes,

442
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,750
companies wouldn't have
had to move their business abroad.

443
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:55,708
Like, take my dad's estate, for example.
They're struggling to make ends meet

444
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,250
because of the high taxes.

445
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,791
[chuckles]

446
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,458
Simon, do you want to share
something with the rest of the class?

447
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,041
It's such a weird question.

448
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:07,166
Why is it called tax "evasion"
but welfare "scam"?

449
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,041
It's all right that rich people cheat, but
when poor people do it, it's messed up.

450
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,083
For rich people,
it's not even called "welfare"

451
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,250
it's called "deduction."

452
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,375
Like your dad.
How much EU subsidies does he get?

453
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:20,750
-And what the fuck does your dad do?
-[teacher] Watch your language, please.

454
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,875
Well, we all know who this country's
biggest welfare receivers are.

455
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,291
[teacher] Simon!

456
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,958
You run like a bunch
of old fucking ladies!

457
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,375
Damn it! You can run faster than that.

458
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,375
I didn't know
you belonged to Forest Ridge.

459
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,333
Well, I don't.

460
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,958
-But you're eating with us?
-We non-residents have to eat somewhere.

461
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:23,500
Um, we haven't
been introduced. I'm Wilhelm.

462
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:25,500
Simon.

463
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:30,333
I liked what you said in there, Simon.

464
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,541
Well said.

465
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,416
[Simon] Okay.

466
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,458
Why didn't you say anything?

467
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,125
'Cause I'm not…

468
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,125
[clears throat]

469
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,333
I'm not allowed
to speak on political issues.

470
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:52,041
Wille?
Would you please come here for a moment?

471
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,750
See you around.

472
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,750
[fork rattles]

473
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:03,958
-Hi.
-Hi.

474
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,625
-No, I…
-Uh-uh. Nils, move.

475
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,541
We'll make an exception today.
Sit with us.

476
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,375
The grown-ups' table. That's great.

477
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,625
Felt like I had to
rescue you from that situation.

478
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,416
Hmm…

479
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,375
[August] Make sure they
leave him at the Palace before the party.

480
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,208
We need to be alone with him
to swear the oath of brotherhood.

481
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:35,333
[Nils] The whole gang of Skogsbacken
will take care of the initiation.

482
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,583
[August] It's gonna be so awesome.

483
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,791
[clears throat] Excuse me, can we…

484
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:43,250
Can we talk?

485
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:50,458
All right. You go ahead, I'll catch up.

486
00:28:57,375 --> 00:29:01,291
If me and my sister can come to the party,
I'll get you that stuff that you wanted.

487
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,083
Really?

488
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,458
Okay. Great.

489
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:08,083
Hey, we won't go blind
from your moonshine, right?

490
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,250
[laughs] Just kidding. Huh?

491
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,708
It's gonna be great.

492
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,875
Well done, you little socialist.

493
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,041
Good boy.

494
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,875
Make sure you check your DMs. Okay?

495
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,458
I'll be in touch. All right?

496
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:22,916
Sweet.

497
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,791
[children yelling playfully]

498
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:40,958
[doorbell rings]

499
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,250
Simme?

500
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:48,958
Hi.

501
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,416
Can I come in?

502
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,833
Yeah. Hell yeah. Come on in.

503
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,083
Come in.

504
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:07,583
You come straight from school?

505
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,125
Good.

506
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,250
I'm sorry about the mess.

507
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:21,041
I wasn't expecting
such distinguished company.

508
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:22,625
Have a seat.

509
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,083
-So, how are things?
-Just fine.

510
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,583
-How's Mom and Sara?
-They're good.

511
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,000
Can I get you some coffee?

512
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,458
How's your back?

513
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,875
It's much better, thanks. I got new meds.

514
