00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:25,834
There are
moments in our lives...

3
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:28,171
that seem to define us.

4
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:34,577
Moments we keep going back to.

5
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:41,317
My life before him was
so simple and decided.

6
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:47,022
And now, after him,
there's just...

7
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:51,427
after.

8
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,001
Tessa!

9
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:39,142
Okay, what are we forgetting?

10
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,544
- Hairdryer.
- Nope.

11
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:43,947
Flashlight.

12
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:46,682
Mom, it's college, it's
not a survival course.

13
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:51,019
Towels. Battery charger.
Phone charger.

14
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,157
I can always drive
anything up, if you forget it.

15
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:58,061
Okay, we should get going.
We have a long drive ahead.

16
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,695
Let's do a last
minute room check.

17
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,798
- Oh, wait, Mom...
- Thank you.

18
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:50,713
- We're on the right floor.
- B-22...

19
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,915
B-22...
Um...

20
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,516
B-22.

21
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:56,218
22... there it is.

22
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:07,495
Hi.

23
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:10,332
Hi. Um...

24
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,103
Steph?

25
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:16,504
In the flesh.

26
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:20,375
I'm Tessa.

27
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:22,845
It's my new roomie.
This is Tristan.

28
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:25,715
Hey.
- Hi. I'm Tessa.

29
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:26,915
Come in, we're not gonna bite.

30
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,484
Oh, sorry.

31
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,821
Uh, so this is my mom
and this is Noah.

32
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,189
- Hello.
- Hi.

33
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:38,326
Full disclosure.

34
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:40,229
I was pretty bummed to be
paired with a freshman.

35
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:43,199
Then I thought,
hello, bright side...

36
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:44,834
I'm going to be
your spirit guide.

37
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:48,004
We can get you into all the
best places even without a fake.

38
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:49,605
No problem.

39
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,211
Mom?

40
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,758
I like your sweater.

41
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:11,860
Thanks, I got it from the Gap.

42
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:15,264
Cute.

43
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:17,165
We're going straight down to
the housing office right now...

44
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,167
and requesting a room change.

45
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,536
Wait, what are you
talking about?

46
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,906
That room reeked of weed,
and you will not...

47
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:26,140
Can you please not make a scene?

48
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,778
I'm not, we have worked
too hard for this...

49
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:30,378
Okay, okay...

50
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,149
and I don't want you to be
distracted by anyone.

51
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,052
Mom, this is me
that we're talking about.

52
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:40,523
Can you please just trust me?

53
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:44,426
It'll be fine, I promise...
promise.

54
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:51,166
House is gonna be
so empty without you.

55
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:54,269
I know. I'll miss you.

56
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,406
Oh, god, I am so proud of you.

57
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:58,273
Thanks, Mom.

58
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,445
Okay. I love you, my baby.

59
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,850
I'm going. See you later.

60
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,120
Bye.

61
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:17,360
I got it.

62
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:23,833
This is the part
I've been dreading.

63
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,800
Me, too.

64
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:28,704
Oh, I was actually talking about
the ride home with your mom.

65
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:37,112
Okay.

66
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:05,707
How much did I
freak your mom out?

67
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,476
Um...

68
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:11,480
She thinks I'm going
to be a bad influence?

69
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,348
She's just very protective.

70
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,752
It's always only
been the two of us.

71
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,689
No, no, thanks.

72
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:24,659
See? Seems like she
has nothing to worry about.

73
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,062
Your brother's cute.

74
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:29,097
Oh, you mean Noah, no,
he's my boyfriend.

75
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:31,099
Shit, sorry.

76
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,236
No, it's okay. He's a
senior in high school.

77
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:37,839
It's Tristan.
I was supposed to meet her.

78
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,344
What's with all the old books?

79
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:44,713
Who brings books to college?

80
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:47,516
Me, I guess.

81
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:51,653
The bookish vibe, I like that.
Alright, I'm out.

82
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:53,489
Okay, bye.

83
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,024
- Hi.
- Hey.

84
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,526
Econ 101?

85
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:32,829
Yeah.

86
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:42,205
It's locked, yeah,
I already tried it.

87
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,138
Right.

88
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:52,147
Couple of early birds, huh?

89
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:55,218
Have fun in there.

90
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,586
- Sorry, after you.
- Oh, after you.

91
00:08:57,686 --> 00:09:00,423
- No, no, honestly, I insist.
- No, I insist.

92
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:01,923
- No, honestly...
- My mother raised me to...

93
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:02,859
Okay.

94
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:08,598
Are you a first year, too?

95
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:11,768
Yeah. Are you an Econ major?

96
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:15,171
That's the plan, you?

97
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,706
I'm an English major.

98
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,076
I'm Landon, by the way.

99
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:22,110
Tessa, hi.

100
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:24,047
Hi, nice to meet you.

101
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,986
Good morning,
I'm Professor Alexander...

102
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:34,657
and welcome to Econ 101.

103
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:37,559
This might be the most important
class you take here...

104
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:41,530
so I expect everyone here
to closely pay attention...

105
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,269
and benefit from the 25-year
career I had on Wall Street.

106
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,903
Now let's get started.

107
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:23,272
Uh, excuse me.

108
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,108
Uh, I think that you're
in the wrong room.

109
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,613
I'm in the right room.

110
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:34,317
How did you even get in here?

111
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:39,521
Okay. Can you please go out into
the hall, so I can get dressed?

112
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,492
Don't flatter yourself,
I'm not looking.

113
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,465
You took your time.

114
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,901
There they are. Hey, Tessa.

115
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,005
Hi, uh, can you please ask your
boyfriend to leave...

116
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,039
so I can get dressed?

117
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,408
Uh, not my boyfriend.
What did you say to her?

118
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:03,110
Nothing. I've been
minding my own business.

119
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:06,048
Okay, well, whoever he is.

120
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,285
You're going out
with us tonight.

121
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:12,487
Yeah, I don't know.

122
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:15,190
I'm trying to picture
this one at a party.

123
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:20,763
Just not seeing it.

124
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:25,868
You're not going to stay
in here forever, right?

125
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:27,736
Nope.

126
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:38,014
The Great Gatsby...
it's a good book.

127
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:41,783
Hate to spoil it...

128
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:46,556
but it was all a dream.

129
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:50,158
Actually...

130
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:53,995
it was all a lie.

131
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,951
What's he looking at?

132
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:18,653
Hello, can I get a
Cappuccino with almond milk...

133
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:20,522
add cinnamon on
top? Sure thing.

134
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,390
I'll have a regular
black coffee, please.

135
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,491
And for you?

136
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:25,059
Can I have
an Americano, please?

137
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,228
No problem.

138
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:27,562
Thanks.

139
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:28,965
Ooh, such a player.

140
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,368
- Now pick it up.
- Thank you.

141
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:34,503
You're picking us
up, right, Zed?

142
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:37,172
When am I
picking you guys up?

143
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:39,174
I don't know, 8:00?

144
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,466
Guess what?

145
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,168
Ssh!

146
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:12,106
We're gonna go to
a party tonight.

147
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:14,576
I don't know.

148
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:18,247
You're going, don't
you want to have fun?

149
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:19,480
Ssh!

150
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:22,018
You, ssh!

151
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,620
Yeah, of course, I do.

152
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,221
Then grab your shit...

153
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:29,291
Yes, okay... okay.

154
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,425
Let's get ready to party.

155
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,713
What do you think? What?

156
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:54,317
It's... it's pretty.

157
00:13:57,852 --> 00:14:03,758
Maybe it's just a
little too formal.

158
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:08,930
You said be myself.

159
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,934
You know what, I
love it. I love it.

160
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:26,748
Oh, isn't it crazy?

161
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:29,450
- Hey!
- Hey. What's up?

162
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:30,619
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

163
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,622
Ooh, chug, chug, chug.

164
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,993
There's my baby.

165
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,761
Wow, wow.

166
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:42,365
Hey, what's up?

167
00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:47,035
- Hi, Tessa.
- Hi.

168
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,273
I need things to be
way less in focus.

169
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,346
Do that again, do that again.

170
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,581
Do it again? I'm
dying over here.

171
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,884
Do it! I want to get
it on the camera.

172
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,721
Sick, bro.

173
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:16,598
Hey, guys, this is my
new roommate, Tessa.

174
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:17,932
This is everybody.

175
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:22,905
Nice to meet you, my name's Zed.

176
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:25,640
You've met
Hardin, and that's Molly.

177
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,741
Hey.

178
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:27,842
You want to sit down?

179
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:30,679
Cute dress.

180
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:37,386
Oh, yeah, and that's
Jace... the Townie.

181
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:38,687
What's up?

182
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:40,989
What's your major, Tessa?

183
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,826
Um, I'm thinking business
or maybe economics.

184
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,263
Very cool.

185
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,165
You want a drink?

186
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:50,899
I don't really drink.

187
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,735
Come on, we're all
drinking, have a drink.

188
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,670
She doesn't drink?
Just a shot.

189
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,372
Do it, come on.
- Just a small one.

190
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,776
Oh, my god, Steph, where'd
you find this girl?

191
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,644
No one's talking to you.

192
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:05,815
Oh... yes!

193
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,121
Cheers to that.

194
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,455
You okay?

195
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:17,293
Ooh, babe.
Aw, poor baby.

196
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,827
You're so pretty.

197
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:24,700
Okay, so, um, guys...
truth or dare?

198
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,867
What?
Truth or dare?

199
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:28,403
- No, no!
- Come on.

200
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,538
Isn't this a kid's game?

201
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,841
Not the way we play.

202
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:35,211
Hey, Tessa, truth or dare?

203
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:37,712
Truth.

204
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,482
Craziest place you've had sex.

205
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:45,254
Um, pass.

206
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,089
Why, it's an easy one.

207
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:57,432
Wait... are you a virgin?

208
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:05,039
- I'll do dare.
- Dare, hm.

209
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,942
I dare you to make
out with Hardin.

210
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,845
She won't do it.

211
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,780
This never ends well.

212
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,367
Do you want to do this?

213
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,972
You having fun, Molly?

214
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,181
I'm done playing this game.

215
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,449
Oooh,
sucks to suck.

216
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:52,855
I like this girl.

217
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:57,491
Hardin Scott got
his first rejection.

218
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:58,994
Denied, bro.

219
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:11,272
Hey.

220
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,475
Hey, I
thought we were gonna Facetime?

221
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,744
Yeah, sorry.

222
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,980
Where are you right
now? It's really loud.

223
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,085
Um, I'm with Steph,
and her friends...

224
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:27,923
but they're all just
like... I don't know.

225
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:30,458
So, you're at a party?

226
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:31,593
Have you been drinking?

227
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:32,760
I just had one drink.

228
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,198
Okay, so you go to college...

229
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,165
and now you drink, that's...
that's really great, Tessa.

230
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,801
Noah, can you not be so like...

231
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,904
So like what? I'm not the one
who's out partying right now.

232
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:45,174
Just forget it.
- Tessa, I want...

233
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,012
My bad.

234
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:51,472
- What are you doing?
- Hm?

235
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,109
Nothing.

236
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:59,181
Are you looking for something?

237
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:04,019
Are you drunk?

238
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:07,622
I don't drink...
just like you don't.

239
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:19,268
"He's more myself than I am.
Whatever our souls are made of.

240
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:22,303
"His and mine are the same."

241
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:27,308
It's Bronte, Teresa?

242
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,481
I know it's Bronte...

243
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,654
and my name is Tessa.

244
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:45,026
What were you doing
in my room, Tessa?

245
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,328
Your room?

246
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,032
Yes.

247
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:06,115
Are we still playing?

248
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,519
'Cause I think
you owe me a dare.

249
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:34,309
Wait, I can't.

250
00:21:38,512 --> 00:21:39,781
I need to go.

251
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:55,430
Don't
doubt me, I got this...

252
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,432
look, look, here we go, ready?

253
00:21:57,531 --> 00:21:59,333
Oh! Nice
shot, all right.

254
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,348
Hi.

255
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:25,119
Hey, I'm glad I'm not the
only freshman in this class.

256
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:27,154
Yeah, I'm psyched
I got in. Yeah.

257
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:30,692
All right, folks,
let's get started...

258
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,427
Jane Austen's masterpiece.

259
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:37,365
Who in here has already
read Pride and Prejudice?

260
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:43,305
And what did you think
of it on the first read?

261
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:49,009
Let's hear from our
newcomer, Mr. Scott.

262
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:53,780
Pride and Prejudice... Elizabeth
Bennett needs to chill.

263
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:58,485
She gave Darcy a way worse
time than he deserved.

264
00:23:58,586 --> 00:24:02,390
Are you saying that Darcy was
not in love with Elizabeth?

265
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,394
Love is just a transaction...

266
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:08,896
we're all hardwired to desire.

267
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:13,468
We present the correct set of
desirable traits and boom...

268
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:16,872
we can turn it on and
we can turn it off.

269
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:22,410
Yes. Ms. Young? Tessa?

270
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:27,147
I think that it was the most
revolutionary feminist novel...

271
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:30,951
that I've ever read, that a
woman of that era would have...

272
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:33,855
the strength to reject Darcy
when he treated her poorly.

273
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:34,990
That's a load.

274
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:42,062
It was Darcy's very attitude
that attracted Elizabeth to him.

275
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:43,899
Darcy's attitude was
rude and mocking.

276
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,600
I think that he was lucky
to be with a woman...

277
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,535
with as much integrity
as Elizabeth.

278
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,503
The only reason he even
asked her to marry him...

279
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:51,573
was 'cause she wouldn't
stop throwing herself...

280
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:53,807
Throwing herself at him?
He was pursuing her.

281
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:55,609
She's clearly not
satisfied with her life...

282
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,746
and is looking for excitement
wherever she can get it.

283
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:00,080
Well, I think that it's
obviously all in his head...

284
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:02,451
that she had any
feelings for him at all.

285
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,287
Well, there you have it.

286
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:10,759
That's the power of a good book.

287
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:17,164
That was exciting.

288
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,634
No, it was annoying.

289
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:20,801
I enjoyed it.

290
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,971
Look, whatever you're
thinking, don't.

291
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,006
Nothing happened between us.
Okay? I have a boyfriend.

292
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:30,444
Us... I thought we were talking
about Pride and Prejudice.

293
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,923
Hey, do you want to
go get some coffee?

294
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:44,224
How can someone be so arrogant?

295
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:46,760
"Elizabeth Bennett
needs to chill."

296
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:51,032
Like who even...
who even says that?

297
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,768
That's just Hardin
being Hardin.

298
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:55,269
You know him?

299
00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:00,541
Yeah, we're, uh, we're
practically related.

300
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,612
My mom is dating
Chancellor Scott.

301
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:08,048
Chancellor Scott
is Hardin's dad...

302
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:12,653
and Hardin and I, we tolerate
each other, but barely.

303
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:15,523
His father's the chancellor?

304
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:16,991
Yeah.

305
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,432
Listen, Tessa, he's just
trying to get a reaction.

306
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:27,767
Well, he's not gonna
get one from me.

307
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:30,871
Hm...

308
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:36,845
Agh!

309
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:38,512
It actually does hurt.

310
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:42,451
You should get one.

311
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:46,354
My mom would literally kill me.

312
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:47,822
You need to get this.

313
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:53,228
I bet you'd love that one.

314
00:26:53,327 --> 00:26:56,096
Yeah, dice...

315
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:58,865
I feel like my mom has
everything planned out for me.

316
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,303
Like, I think she's been
planning my wedding

317
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:05,105
to Noah since we were five.

318
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:09,043
Wait, is Noah the only dude
you've ever gone out with?

319
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,882
That's sad.

320
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,253
Ooh, ow!

321
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:21,089
Watch it.

322
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:24,659
Yeah, you guys really
aren't selling me on this.

323
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:37,138
Ssh! You
look so good tonight.

324
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:39,974
Shh!

325
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:09,538
Can I get a
small coffee, please?

326
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:18,913
Here you go.

327
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:20,514
Yeah, thanks.

328
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:36,531
- Hi.
- Hi.

329
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,733
I can't stay away from you.

330
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:43,538
What?

331
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:46,473
Well, we're gonna
see each other.

332
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:49,510
I'm friends with Steph
and you're roommates.

333
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,183
Tessa, let's just start over,
just reset and we can be...

334
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:58,453
What... friends?

335
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,255
Why not?

336
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,225
I want to show you something.

337
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,962
So show me then.

338
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:10,866
It's a... it's a place.

339
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:18,039
I think that it's better
if we keep our distance.

340
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:27,115
I'll see you around.

341
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:41,555
It's down this way. Come on.

342
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,061
Welcome to my favorite place.

343
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,399
It's beautiful.

344
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:35,909
- How about a swim?
- Hm?

345
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:45,718
What are... what are you doing?

346
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:47,154
I'm going swimming.

347
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,860
Hardin...

348
00:31:59,032 --> 00:31:59,933
Hardin.

349
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,271
Come in.

350
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:08,776
You can wear my t-shirt.

351
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:14,948
It feels amazing.

352
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:31,465
A little privacy, please?

353
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:43,410
Okay.

354
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,151
What?

355
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:55,323
I like it better on you.

356
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:38,266
Can I ask you something?

357
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:40,201
Do I even have a choice?

358
00:33:43,202 --> 00:33:47,674
Who do you love the
most in the world?

359
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,045
Easy... myself.

360
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:55,817
Of course, you do.

361
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:00,653
What's your boyfriend's name?

362
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:02,290
It's Noah.

363
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,694
Noah... does he go here?

364
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,528
He's in high school.

365
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:11,298
High school?

366
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:14,701
And what does a high school
kid do to deserve you?

367
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,372
He is nice to me.

368
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,240
Nice?

369
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:23,577
Isn't that just another
word for boring?

370
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:27,847
Not always.

371
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:30,918
Can I show you something?

372
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:36,190
Hold your breath.

373
00:34:55,608 --> 00:35:00,114
Silence... it's peaceful.

374
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,153
You think that's weird?

375
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:10,357
No... not at all.

376
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:55,602
I thought that you just
wanted to be friends.

377
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:02,576
I don't think we can
ever be just friends.

378
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:03,797
Have you never been
touched before?

379
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:20,414
Why'd you stop?

380
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,187
We've got time.

381
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,160
So, why do you
call them "chips"?

382
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,129
Why do you call them "fries"?

383
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:36,128
Because they're fried.

384
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:39,065
They're not French.

385
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,670
You've got plenty there.

386
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:44,838
Hey, uh, I ordered
mine without ketchup.

387
00:38:44,938 --> 00:38:45,972
Oh, right, I'll be right back.

388
00:38:46,072 --> 00:38:48,208
Thank you.

389
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:51,846
No ketchup?
That's very un-American.

390
00:38:51,945 --> 00:38:53,713
I'm full of surprises.

391
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:59,920
So... what's your story then?

392
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,422
My story?

393
00:39:02,456 --> 00:39:07,728
Yeah. Like, your family?
How you ended up here?

394
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:09,496
Pass.

395
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:16,836
I just don't think asking a
bunch of arbitrary questions...

396
00:39:16,936 --> 00:39:21,007
about someone's past is really
gonna tell you who they are.

397
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,210
I can find out who you
are by sitting here...

398
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:26,180
and spending time with you.

399
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:34,621
What?

400
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,858
What?

401
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,260
What are you doing?

402
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,364
I'm just waiting for you to
reveal your true self to me...

403
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:46,833
by just sitting here and
spending time with you.

404
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:48,001
Here you go.

405
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:50,503
Thank you.

406
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:54,708
Okay, fair enough...
one question.

407
00:39:57,378 --> 00:39:59,113
Why do you have all
those romance novels...

408
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:00,781
if you don't believe in love?

409
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:02,450
Who says I don't
believe in love?

410
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:06,219
You did, in Soto's class.

411
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,157
True.

412
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,395
Maybe don't believe
everything I say then.

413
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:17,797
Oh, hey, guys.

414
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,335
Hey, Tessa.

415
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:28,175
Guys, let's just hang
out for a minute.

416
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:30,878
So... what have
you two been up to?

417
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:33,880
- We were just...
- We're just getting some food.

418
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:36,950
Oh, how's the boyfriend, Tess?

419
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,919
We're leaving.

420
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:40,486
Perfect. I need a ride.

421
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:43,222
It's not a good time, you
can ask Zed for a ride.

422
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:44,958
Dude, we literally
just got here.

423
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:46,160
Excuse me.

424
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,295
You're excused.

425
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:54,668
All right... Tessa?

426
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:56,871
Really?

427
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:02,210
Yes, I won't be long.

428
00:41:10,817 --> 00:41:12,019
I'll be at the bar.

429
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,954
See you around.

430
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,026
What's up, bro?

431
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:20,728
So, fill us in.

432
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:29,469
- What was that?
- What was what?

433
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,572
Were you like embarrassed
that they saw us together?

434
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,474
No.

435
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:41,480
You know, I'm going to tell
Noah about us, I just...

436
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:47,288
Us? What do you mean "us"?

437
00:41:47,387 --> 00:41:49,956
If you want to dump Mr. High
School, then go ahead...

438
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:51,324
but don't do it on my account.

439
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:55,596
What?

440
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,768
Look, it was fun,
but I don't date.

441
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:11,778
Are you actually kidding me?

442
00:43:50,344 --> 00:43:51,612
You're here.

443
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:13,233
What are you dreaming about?

444
00:44:28,014 --> 00:44:29,983
Surprise!

445
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:35,588
What... what are you...
what are you doing here?

446
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:39,927
How are you?

447
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:43,764
Thank you.

448
00:44:45,398 --> 00:44:47,534
Are you okay?

449
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:50,237
Yeah. No, yeah, yeah, of course.

450
00:44:50,336 --> 00:44:51,704
- Okay.
- Thank you.

451
00:44:51,804 --> 00:44:52,672
Yeah.

452
00:44:53,672 --> 00:44:54,974
So, what are we gonna do?

453
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:11,157
Hey,
there's Tessa.

454
00:45:11,257 --> 00:45:12,324
What's
up, Tessa?

455
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:13,527
Hey.

456
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:18,264
Hi.
We met at the dorm.

457
00:45:18,364 --> 00:45:20,466
- So, he does exist.
- Nice to meet you.

458
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:21,601
What's up, man, it's
Zed, how's it going?

459
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:22,736
Good, how are you doing?

460
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,741
Cool, campfire.

461
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:29,843
Tessa.

462
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:30,778
Thanks.

463
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:34,714
Cops will probably
be here soon, so...

464
00:45:34,813 --> 00:45:37,416
Oh, should we get out of here?

465
00:45:46,025 --> 00:45:49,128
Hey, Tessa, didn't
expect to see you here.

466
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,137
So, how about we play a
game of Suck and Blow?

467
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:00,574
Suck and Blow, I'm down.

468
00:46:00,673 --> 00:46:01,976
Okay, I got it.

469
00:46:05,445 --> 00:46:08,081
- Yes!
- Aww.

470
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:10,450
Guess you know what that
means. Oh, no, no, I'm...

471
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:11,918
Whoa, dude, dude, dude...

472
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:14,052
Leave it, Jace.
Don't go there, all right?

473
00:46:14,153 --> 00:46:15,655
Chill out, man,
it's just a game, man.

474
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:17,391
- Hey, man, she doesn't have...
- Leave it, Jace.

475
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,157
Relax, dude. Hey, relax.

476
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:23,530
Whoa! Hey!

477
00:46:25,565 --> 00:46:28,869
Hey, hey, hey, get off!

478
00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:32,605
You're
gonna regret this.

479
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,943
Dude, you're freaking!
What are you doing, man?

480
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:40,280
- Hardin?
- Hardin?

481
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:55,296
And the referee
gives a yellow card!

482
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:00,800
This crowd is not happy at all.

483
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:49,349
Hey, thanks for coming.

484
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,951
What happened?

485
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,355
Uh, well, it started
about his father

486
00:47:55,454 --> 00:47:59,793
and then your name
sort of came up.

487
00:48:02,528 --> 00:48:03,896
He won't talk to me

488
00:48:03,996 --> 00:48:09,068
so I figured maybe
he would talk to you.

489
00:48:09,168 --> 00:48:11,105
Where is he?

490
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:32,458
What are you doing here?

491
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,728
I was worried about you.

492
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:39,732
Shouldn't you be
with your perfect

493
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,268
little boyfriend, Teresa?

494
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:43,070
Don't bring Noah into this.

495
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:47,140
I thought you didn't drink.

496
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:48,908
I don't.

497
00:48:50,476 --> 00:48:53,646
I didn't what does it matter?

498
00:48:53,746 --> 00:48:55,815
You made a real mess in there.

499
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:59,318
I was celebrating.
Didn't you hear?

500
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:06,558
Dear old Dad is getting married.

501
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:09,697
You should see the dump my poor
mom lives in back in London.

502
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:18,806
Don't you feel like
you've had enough?

503
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:38,024
Don't, I can get it.

504
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,293
Ow, damn it.

505
00:49:45,731 --> 00:49:47,467
Come with me.

506
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,992
I'm sorry for how I treated you.

507
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:23,002
Um, if... if you don't date,
if that's how you feel...

508
00:50:26,172 --> 00:50:29,108
I don't think that is
how I feel anymore.

509
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:36,283
I'm a mess.

510
00:50:41,221 --> 00:50:43,891
I think that we're both a mess.

511
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:47,186
You don't ever have to
cover up, not for me.

512
00:53:32,391 --> 00:53:34,660
Hey. You okay?

513
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,195
Yeah.

514
00:53:36,295 --> 00:53:38,231
Where were you, I texted
you, you didn't answer me.

515
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:41,101
Um, I'm sorry. My
phone died, I'm sorry.

516
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:42,702
Where were you?

517
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,939
A friend needed my help.

518
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:47,474
But... in the middle
of the night?

519
00:54:03,155 --> 00:54:05,157
Noah, I can explain, can we...

520
00:54:07,592 --> 00:54:11,864
Please, can we just...
can we just go inside and talk?

521
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:13,199
I don't...

522
00:54:13,298 --> 00:54:14,634
No...

523
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:17,168
I don't believe this.

524
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:21,306
No, Noah...
Noah, wait.

525
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:24,110
Noah, I'm...
I'm confused.

526
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:28,014
I wanted to talk to you
about it for a while.

527
00:54:28,114 --> 00:54:30,617
I am so, so sorry.

528
00:54:38,724 --> 00:54:40,460
Noah...

529
00:54:52,905 --> 00:54:54,073
Tessa...

530
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:56,742
Go home, Hardin.

531
00:55:18,764 --> 00:55:22,802
Noah and I just broke up.

532
00:55:25,371 --> 00:55:28,508
I feel like I just
lost my best friend.

533
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:33,579
Come over here.

534
00:57:01,934 --> 00:57:03,836
I didn't expect to see you.

535
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:20,220
When my dad left, I was 10.

536
00:57:24,456 --> 00:57:28,360
He left us with nothing.

537
00:57:31,231 --> 00:57:37,204
And my mom, she just
sort of fell apart.

538
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,108
I had to take
care of her alone

539
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:47,213
but Noah was there
for me, you know?

540
00:57:50,617 --> 00:57:53,486
I hate myself for
what I did to him.

541
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:57,990
Tessa, it's not your fault.

542
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,960
Yeah, it is.

543
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,269
Noah's my best friend.

544
00:58:13,572 --> 00:58:15,341
But you...

545
00:58:21,514 --> 00:58:23,516
You're so much more.

546
00:58:33,293 --> 00:58:34,661
Library is closing.

547
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,028
Library is
getting ready to close.

548
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,032
Library is closing!

549
00:58:42,168 --> 00:58:44,170
- Follow me.
- Hm?

550
00:58:44,269 --> 00:58:45,704
- Come on.
- What are...

551
00:58:45,804 --> 00:58:47,473
Down here.

552
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:52,311
Ssh.

553
00:59:03,222 --> 00:59:07,360
"You could draw me to fire.
You could draw me to water.

554
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,528
"You could draw
me to the gallows.

555
00:59:09,628 --> 00:59:11,831
"You could draw me to any death.

556
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:14,534
"You could draw me to
anything I've most avoided.

557
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,836
"This and the confusion
of my thoughts.

558
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:21,205
"So that time fit for
nothing is what I mean

559
00:59:21,306 --> 00:59:24,943
"by your being the ruin of me."

560
00:59:25,043 --> 00:59:28,780
Why'd you stop?

561
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,116
We should go.

562
00:59:37,356 --> 00:59:41,428
Hey! What are you
doing here? Stop!

563
01:00:39,452 --> 01:00:42,621
Perhaps the most
mesmerizing of all things

564
01:00:42,721 --> 01:00:45,590
is the binary star couple.

565
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:49,461
Two stars find their way
across vast stretches of space

566
01:00:49,561 --> 01:00:52,531
and time to find
another wandering body

567
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:56,568
and become attached for
eternity in each others' orbit.

568
01:00:56,668 --> 01:01:02,574
Each star pushing the other
to explode in supernova...

569
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:10,983
becoming either the
nucleus of planetary nebula

570
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:14,853
or just as often,
resulting in a death spiral.

571
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:19,959
What are you doing,
Tessa? Learning about the stars?

572
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:25,264
The stars assist
in each others' system.

573
01:01:25,364 --> 01:01:30,036
Do you have any idea
how beautiful you are right now?

574
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:38,944
What are you always
writing in there?

575
01:01:39,045 --> 01:01:40,880
None of your business.

576
01:01:50,222 --> 01:01:52,192
- Show me.
- No.

577
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:56,161
- Come on!
- No chance!

578
01:01:56,262 --> 01:01:57,964
I just want to see what's...

579
01:03:04,297 --> 01:03:06,599
Tessa, hun?

580
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,166
I've called all the... Tessa?

581
01:03:08,266 --> 01:03:11,702
Mom? What are you doing here?

582
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:14,106
What the hell is going on?

583
01:03:14,206 --> 01:03:15,440
Nothing.

584
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,844
Who's he? Is he the
guy Noah told me about?

585
01:03:17,943 --> 01:03:20,913
So this is how you spend your
time instead of going to class?

586
01:03:21,012 --> 01:03:22,380
No!
- I think I should go.

587
01:03:22,481 --> 01:03:23,648
You think?

588
01:03:23,748 --> 01:03:27,052
Can we talk about this
outside please? Please!

589
01:03:28,788 --> 01:03:31,123
You, go! Come with me.

590
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,829
You have got to be kidding me.

591
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,831
I knew as soon as I
saw that roommate

592
01:03:39,931 --> 01:03:41,232
that something like
this would happen.

593
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,202
Are you serious right now?

594
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:44,871
And after all this work

595
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:48,541
and you are gonna throw
it away for some boy!

596
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:50,610
What are you talking
about? I'm not.

597
01:03:52,177 --> 01:03:54,212
You're going to break
up with this boy

598
01:03:54,313 --> 01:03:57,783
and you are going to
focus on your schoolwork.

599
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:04,956
Do you even know what it
has been like trying to be

600
01:04:05,056 --> 01:04:08,960
perfect for you,
having you mold my life

601
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:11,764
into the way that
you wanted it to be?

602
01:04:11,864 --> 01:04:15,001
I did it for your own good.

603
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:19,171
I am so, so sorry, Mom, that
your life didn't work out

604
01:04:19,271 --> 01:04:23,042
the way that you wanted
it to, I really am

605
01:04:23,141 --> 01:04:26,211
but this is my life and
you have to let me live it.

606
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,353
Is that really what you want?

607
01:04:34,452 --> 01:04:36,655
Yes.

608
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:51,237
If I leave now, you're cut off.

609
01:04:57,809 --> 01:05:00,145
He's gonna break your heart.

610
01:05:20,998 --> 01:05:23,601
She's cutting
you off because of Hardin.

611
01:05:23,702 --> 01:05:26,271
I'm just a little
worried, is all?

612
01:05:26,371 --> 01:05:28,541
Why?

613
01:05:28,641 --> 01:05:31,144
Hardin is...

614
01:05:31,244 --> 01:05:34,680
Hardin is complicated.

615
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,151
Yeah, I know, but he's
different around me.

616
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:41,187
Just be careful.

617
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,734
You okay?

618
01:05:56,835 --> 01:05:59,204
Yeah. Where have you been?

619
01:06:01,672 --> 01:06:04,810
Jump in and I'll show you.

620
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,885
- You ready?
- Yes!

621
01:06:12,985 --> 01:06:15,221
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

622
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,329
Who's place is this?

623
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:30,469
A friend of my
father's, a professor.

624
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,072
Where are they?

625
01:06:33,172 --> 01:06:39,177
She's in Italy. Oh yeah, I'm
meant to be watering the plants.

626
01:06:42,414 --> 01:06:44,016
Ooh, she paints.

627
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:55,094
It's really nice.

628
01:06:58,697 --> 01:07:00,967
Imagine if it were our place.

629
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:03,601
Sure.

630
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:05,505
It can be.

631
01:07:07,338 --> 01:07:12,210
What, you mean,
like live together?

632
01:07:18,016 --> 01:07:19,985
When you told me your mom
was going to cut you off

633
01:07:20,085 --> 01:07:21,753
I had to do something.

634
01:07:21,853 --> 01:07:24,890
We can stay here for
the rest of the year

635
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,059
just you and me.

636
01:07:34,365 --> 01:07:36,369
You did this for me?

637
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:02,260
- Here.
- Mm-hm.

638
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:12,103
You're gonna bring out
the best of our loves.

639
01:08:12,204 --> 01:08:13,072
Mm-hm.

640
01:08:18,377 --> 01:08:19,579
Whoa!

641
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:16,002
Look at that one.
It looks a bit like you.

642
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:21,072
This is crazy.

643
01:09:36,654 --> 01:09:39,057
I still can't believe it.

644
01:09:39,158 --> 01:09:40,960
Hm? Believe what?

645
01:09:43,462 --> 01:09:45,431
That you're mine.

646
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:49,501
Not this again.

647
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:55,373
I don't deserve you.

648
01:09:58,577 --> 01:10:03,949
Nothing could ever change the
way that I feel about you.

649
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:26,104
- I can not believe you've
talked me into this.

650
01:10:26,204 --> 01:10:30,009
- It's a wedding reception,
it's not a jail sentence.

651
01:10:33,278 --> 01:10:34,313
Hey!

652
01:10:34,412 --> 01:10:36,280
- Hey, you guys made it.
- Yeah.

653
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:39,250
- You look beautiful, Tessa.
- Oh, thank you.

654
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,719
Hey, you clean up well, man.

655
01:10:41,854 --> 01:10:43,255
This is so fancy.

656
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:46,025
Yeah, it's beautiful.

657
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:48,560
So we're brothers.

658
01:10:50,561 --> 01:10:51,730
Yeah.

659
01:10:53,532 --> 01:10:56,569
You must be really happy
for your mom and Ken.

660
01:10:56,668 --> 01:10:59,104
Yeah, yeah, I am.

661
01:11:01,038 --> 01:11:03,041
I'll see you two in there.

662
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:13,118
This looks so good.

663
01:11:29,268 --> 01:11:33,372
Look who's here.
It's good to see you.

664
01:11:33,471 --> 01:11:34,739
You, too.

665
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,875
And you must be...
- Tessa.

666
01:11:36,975 --> 01:11:38,143
Tessa.
Tessa, I'm Karen.

667
01:11:38,243 --> 01:11:39,311
- Hi.
- I'm Landon's mom.

668
01:11:39,412 --> 01:11:40,979
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

669
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:42,715
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

670
01:11:44,283 --> 01:11:46,885
It means a lot to me
that you could be here.

671
01:11:46,984 --> 01:11:48,853
Congratulations.

672
01:11:48,953 --> 01:11:51,056
Thanks for coming.

673
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:55,560
I'm happy you decided
to join us, son.

674
01:11:55,659 --> 01:11:57,829
Landon tells us you're in
Professor Soto's seminar.

675
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:59,064
Yeah.

676
01:11:59,163 --> 01:12:01,233
So, you're an English major?

677
01:12:01,332 --> 01:12:04,735
Um, I would love to, but I think
if I want to be employed

678
01:12:04,836 --> 01:12:07,673
maybe business or econ.

679
01:12:07,773 --> 01:12:09,809
If you're interested in the
business side of literature

680
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,909
my friend owns a
publishing company.

681
01:12:12,011 --> 01:12:13,878
You mean Vance?
- Yes.

682
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:15,747
Well, I can call Vance for her.

683
01:12:15,846 --> 01:12:18,416
Of course, I'm sure he'd
be happy to hear from you.

684
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:25,190
Ken, Dana's arrived.
I think we should go say hi.

685
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:28,426
Enjoy.

686
01:12:29,994 --> 01:12:32,198
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.

687
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:42,908
Let's just have fun.

688
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,644
I can't.

689
01:12:45,743 --> 01:12:48,413
Why not?

690
01:12:48,514 --> 01:12:51,317
You made me promise to
be on my best behavior.

691
01:13:25,917 --> 01:13:28,252
Thank you all for coming.

692
01:13:28,353 --> 01:13:32,056
Tonight we celebrate
great, good fortune

693
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:35,493
and her name is Karen.

694
01:13:35,592 --> 01:13:39,331
The love of my life and...
and frankly she saved my life.

695
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:44,802
I'm suddenly blessed by a
new bride, a new life and

696
01:13:44,904 --> 01:13:48,340
not one, but two
brilliant sons...

697
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:52,744
Hardin and Landon.

698
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,750
I remember an earlier time
when my greatest pleasure

699
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:02,420
was to listen to Hardin,
who loved to recite passages

700
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,490
from novels, all by memory

701
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:08,126
and he would perform
them, leaving me with tears...

702
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:10,863
He's not the man I grew up with.
- or laughter.

703
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:15,234
My father was a drunk
and nothing more.

704
01:14:17,502 --> 01:14:21,172
At least he's trying

705
01:14:21,271 --> 01:14:23,576
which is more than
my father ever did.

706
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:27,911
People change.

707
01:14:28,011 --> 01:14:32,082
Clearly, but that still
doesn't change what happened.

708
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,823
What happened?

709
01:14:43,095 --> 01:14:45,331
One night, when I was eight

710
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:53,738
my dad was at the pub,
drunk as usual.

711
01:14:54,972 --> 01:14:58,208
He messed with the wrong guys.

712
01:14:58,309 --> 01:15:00,746
They came to our
house for payback.

713
01:15:02,913 --> 01:15:04,416
He wasn't there.

714
01:15:07,284 --> 01:15:08,820
They found my mom instead.

715
01:15:11,823 --> 01:15:13,859
I tried...

716
01:15:18,863 --> 01:15:21,934
I tried to fight them
off, but I couldn't.

717
01:15:24,869 --> 01:15:29,774
Thank you, my friends, my
family and university faculty.

718
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:34,813
And that's my dad, the
beloved Chancellor Scott.

719
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:38,951
Let's have fun!

720
01:15:47,658 --> 01:15:51,929
I don't suppose you recall
any of those passages.

721
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:56,434
Not the way you remember it.

722
01:15:56,534 --> 01:16:00,072
I would love to have a dance
with your brilliant son.

723
01:17:37,301 --> 01:17:39,003
I want you now.

724
01:18:21,578 --> 01:18:23,548
Are you sure?

725
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,485
Yeah.

726
01:18:46,604 --> 01:18:48,507
Do you want me to stop?

727
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:53,244
No, just go slow.

728
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,073
- Car.
- It was "cat".

729
01:19:21,172 --> 01:19:22,840
Do another one.

730
01:19:29,547 --> 01:19:33,652
Uh-that one is...

731
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:39,524
- I have no idea!
- I'm really good at this, yeah.

732
01:19:39,623 --> 01:19:42,126
Okay, just do one more,
I promise, I'll get it.

733
01:19:57,207 --> 01:19:59,476
Um...

734
01:20:11,421 --> 01:20:17,061
Hm I don't know, what was it?

735
01:20:36,515 --> 01:20:39,951
Can always stay up
late and work on that.

736
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:41,853
- I'll just see you.
- I'll text you.

737
01:20:55,533 --> 01:20:57,168
Hey.

738
01:20:57,268 --> 01:20:59,002
Hey.

739
01:20:59,103 --> 01:21:01,206
How's it going? I haven't seen
you since like the bonfire.

740
01:21:02,673 --> 01:21:06,043
Yeah, I've been busy, I guess.

741
01:21:07,746 --> 01:21:10,349
How's it going with you
and your boyfriend?

742
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:15,520
Uh, we're not together anymore.

743
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:18,289
Ouch. Bye-bye, high school.

744
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,024
Yeah, it was pretty painful.

745
01:21:20,123 --> 01:21:24,094
Yeah, I can tell you
moved on pretty quickly.

746
01:21:24,194 --> 01:21:25,529
How's Hardin?

747
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,898
What do you mean?

748
01:21:26,997 --> 01:21:29,232
He told me you guys
have been hanging out.

749
01:21:29,332 --> 01:21:31,402
Yeah, we have.

750
01:21:33,104 --> 01:21:34,740
Cool.

751
01:21:36,207 --> 01:21:37,942
Really?

752
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:42,247
Yeah, I mean Hardin
does what Hardin does.

753
01:22:26,256 --> 01:22:27,858
What's wrong?

754
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,297
What's all this about?

755
01:22:32,396 --> 01:22:35,966
What didn't you tell me?

756
01:22:36,067 --> 01:22:37,769
Nothing. I don't know
what she's talking about.

757
01:22:37,868 --> 01:22:39,703
You don't know what
she's talking about?

758
01:22:39,804 --> 01:22:41,506
- I mean, I don't know.
- What didn't you tell me?

759
01:22:41,605 --> 01:22:42,474
Nothing.

760
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,577
I need to go.

761
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:49,012
What, now? Hardin, answer me!
Where are you going?

762
01:22:49,113 --> 01:22:50,981
- Out.
- What's going on?

763
01:22:54,452 --> 01:22:55,753
Do you trust me?

764
01:22:55,853 --> 01:22:56,887
Of course, I do, I just...

765
01:22:56,988 --> 01:22:58,323
Then what's the problem?

766
01:24:25,176 --> 01:24:26,911
What are you doing
in Hardin's car?

767
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:29,414
What, I can't borrow his car?

768
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:34,019
Jace, just tell me where he is!

769
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:39,257
Maybe he's at Blind Bob's.

770
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:11,957
Oh, my gosh, hey.
What's the matter?

771
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:16,394
Are you okay?

772
01:25:16,493 --> 01:25:18,095
Yeah.

773
01:25:18,195 --> 01:25:20,930
You want some fries,
are you hungry?

774
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:24,835
I haven't seen
you since you moved out.

775
01:25:24,935 --> 01:25:29,973
Um, I've been living
with Hardin off-campus.

776
01:25:30,073 --> 01:25:33,744
Wait, you two are
living together?

777
01:25:33,845 --> 01:25:35,012
Yeah.

778
01:25:35,113 --> 01:25:37,648
Wow, Tessa, I didn't know
you two were that serious.

779
01:25:37,747 --> 01:25:39,282
Yeah, we are.

780
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:41,653
How long has
this been going on for?

781
01:25:41,752 --> 01:25:42,920
Look who I found.

782
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:44,288
Oh, hey, Jace, hi, Hardin.

783
01:25:44,387 --> 01:25:46,789
- What's up? What's up, Tessa?
- You are very talented.

784
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:48,826
I got you.

785
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:50,261
Tessa?

786
01:25:52,296 --> 01:25:54,765
Hi, Hardin.

787
01:25:54,865 --> 01:25:57,469
Tessa was just
telling us the latest.

788
01:25:59,136 --> 01:26:02,072
Tessa's been filling us
in on all the details.

789
01:26:02,172 --> 01:26:03,240
Moving in together?

790
01:26:03,341 --> 01:26:06,277
And you guys are so adorable.

791
01:26:06,377 --> 01:26:09,614
Is there anything you
want to tell Tessa?

792
01:26:09,713 --> 01:26:12,283
Yeah, like what's been going
on between you and her?

793
01:26:12,382 --> 01:26:13,783
Nothing's going on
with me and her.

794
01:26:13,884 --> 01:26:15,953
Well, I don't believe you.

795
01:26:16,052 --> 01:26:17,320
What have you said?!

796
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:20,158
- Tessa, I swear...
- I saw the texts that she sent.

797
01:26:20,257 --> 01:26:22,226
What te... they
didn't mean anything.

798
01:26:22,327 --> 01:26:23,594
I didn't even reply to
them, they meant nothing.

799
01:26:23,694 --> 01:26:26,130
- You're kidding me.
- Tessa, nothing's going on.

800
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:28,431
Don't you think this thing
has gone a little too far?

801
01:26:28,532 --> 01:26:31,336
What thing, Hardin?

802
01:26:31,435 --> 01:26:35,306
Something's going on, but
it's not what you think.

803
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:37,275
Molly, shut up.

804
01:26:40,144 --> 01:26:44,849
Tessa, let's get out of
here and I'll explain.

805
01:26:44,948 --> 01:26:47,217
I'll explain
everything, I promise.

806
01:26:47,318 --> 01:26:49,119
Remember truth or dare?

807
01:26:50,921 --> 01:26:52,922
What?

808
01:26:53,023 --> 01:26:54,458
Molly, don't.

809
01:26:57,028 --> 01:26:58,463
Molly!

810
01:26:59,863 --> 01:27:02,466
I'm done playing this game.

811
01:27:04,467 --> 01:27:06,304
- Oh!
- I like this girl.

812
01:27:06,404 --> 01:27:11,809
Looks like Hardin Scott
just got his first rejection.

813
01:27:11,908 --> 01:27:13,810
You don't think I
can make it happen?

814
01:27:13,911 --> 01:27:16,145
Make what
happen, Hardin?

815
01:27:16,247 --> 01:27:20,151
Here's a dare: make her
fall in love with me

816
01:27:20,251 --> 01:27:24,088
and then, I'll just...

817
01:27:26,556 --> 01:27:28,259
turn it off.

818
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,502
It was all a game.

819
01:27:38,735 --> 01:27:44,274
Tessa, Tessa...

820
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:46,578
Tessa, please you
have to believe me.

821
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:51,048
Tessa, that was
before everything,

822
01:27:51,148 --> 01:27:54,219
before I got to know you.

823
01:27:59,856 --> 01:28:01,525
Is that true?

824
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:12,636
And all of you knew?

825
01:28:21,845 --> 01:28:23,547
Tessa.

826
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:55,445
Tessa, wait. Tessa!

827
01:28:55,546 --> 01:28:58,682
So, what exactly did
you tell them, then?

828
01:28:58,783 --> 01:29:00,185
Nothing.

829
01:29:02,252 --> 01:29:04,122
None of it was real.

830
01:29:05,722 --> 01:29:08,926
I actually thought...

831
01:29:09,025 --> 01:29:10,761
I thought that...

832
01:29:15,798 --> 01:29:18,235
You're just a liar.

833
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,936
That was all before...

834
01:29:20,037 --> 01:29:21,572
Before what?

835
01:29:21,671 --> 01:29:23,072
Before...

836
01:29:23,173 --> 01:29:25,510
You snapped your fingers
and you turned it off.

837
01:29:32,483 --> 01:29:35,619
You said nothing could change
the way you felt about me.

838
01:29:39,056 --> 01:29:41,626
Then, I guess we're both liars.

839
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,235
Hi, Mom.

840
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:51,655
What happened?

841
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:57,829
I don't really want
to talk about it.

842
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:09,840
I just... I came here
to say that I'm sorry.

843
01:32:15,846 --> 01:32:19,951
I'm... I'm sorry, too.

844
01:32:23,154 --> 01:32:24,856
I love you.

845
01:32:58,088 --> 01:32:59,657
So how come you're back?

846
01:33:02,259 --> 01:33:04,429
I just needed to come home.

847
01:33:14,637 --> 01:33:16,740
I'm so sorry, Noah.

848
01:33:19,076 --> 01:33:21,445
I never meant to hurt you.

849
01:33:25,916 --> 01:33:27,918
Yeah, I know.

850
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:37,862
I guess I just never
saw any of this coming.

851
01:33:40,597 --> 01:33:48,738
Yeah, but that's
like the point, right?

852
01:33:48,838 --> 01:33:53,443
We like... we change and
we discover who we are.

853
01:33:53,542 --> 01:33:56,380
I think that's okay.

854
01:33:57,847 --> 01:33:59,216
Yeah?

855
01:33:59,315 --> 01:34:00,717
Yeah.

856
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:21,559
On a parting note,
I was deeply impressed by all

857
01:36:21,658 --> 01:36:25,028
of your papers attacking our
themes for this semester.

858
01:36:25,128 --> 01:36:28,298
Congratulations on
all of your good work.

859
01:36:40,144 --> 01:36:41,846
Miss Young?

860
01:36:45,314 --> 01:36:47,984
This is what Hardin turned in.

861
01:36:48,085 --> 01:36:52,222
I think it was actually written
more for you than it was for me.

862
01:36:59,229 --> 01:37:02,431
Thank you.

863
01:37:32,761 --> 01:37:34,931
What is that?

864
01:37:36,834 --> 01:37:42,172
Oh, a secret spot, and
a good place to think.

865
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:55,451
I've read
hundreds of novels in my life.

866
01:37:55,551 --> 01:37:59,790
Most of them claiming that love
was the center of the universe.

867
01:37:59,889 --> 01:38:02,825
That it could heal any
damage inside of us.

868
01:38:02,925 --> 01:38:05,361
That it was what
we need to survive.

869
01:38:10,334 --> 01:38:14,037
From Darcy to Heathcliff,
I thought they were fools.

870
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:16,305
That love was
something fictional

871
01:38:16,406 --> 01:38:20,443
only found in worn
pages of a book.

872
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:24,514
But that has all changed since
I met my Elizabeth Bennet.

873
01:38:29,185 --> 01:38:31,955
I never thought I would
find myself completely

874
01:38:32,054 --> 01:38:36,225
and utterly consumed
by another until her.

875
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:40,431
She took my hand and led
me out of the darkness

876
01:38:40,531 --> 01:38:43,399
and showed me that whatever
our souls are made of

877
01:38:46,036 --> 01:38:49,306
hers and mine are the same.

878
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:59,350
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

879
01:39:01,585 --> 01:39:04,555
You once asked who I
loved most in this world.

880
01:39:14,296 --> 01:39:16,433
It's you.

881
01:39:28,574 --> 01:39:33,574
