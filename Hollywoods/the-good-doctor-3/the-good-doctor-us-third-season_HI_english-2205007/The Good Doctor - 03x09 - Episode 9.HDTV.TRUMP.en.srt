1
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,765
Mm.

2
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,200
Kinda overcooked
the eggs.

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,994
Not used to a gas stove.
Sorry.

4
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,872
Last thing I want
is food right now.

5
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:42,667
Ah, lightweight.

6
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,086
You know, I outdrank you
at least two to one.

7
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,963
Never mind
I was rolling on Molly.

8
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,882
I'm a cheap date.

9
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:52,176
I'll take the coffee,
though.

10
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:56,472
You're a doctor?

11
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:03,980
Well, Dr. Browne...

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,441
I had fun last night.

13
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,026
Me too.

14
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,282
And that unenthusiastic response
answers my question.

15
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,160
"Wanna meet up again?"

16
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,749
I'll get out of here.

17
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,019
Hey, Shaun ‐‐

18
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,022
I have a question
for Dr. Glassman.

19
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,899
Uh, he's, uh,
in the shower.

20
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,359
Do you want to come on ‐‐
When did his shower begin?

21
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,153
Just ‐‐ He just got in.

22
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,697
His showers
are at least nine minutes.

23
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,616
I'd be late to work.

24
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,160
I'll wait.
This is important.

25
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:10,379
Is there something
I can help with?

26
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,382
The florist told me
the pink roses express passion

27
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:15,927
and the purple Peruvian lilies
convey devotion,

28
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,096
but I feel both passion
and devotion for Carly.

29
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:20,306
You could give her both.

30
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,729
Please ask Dr. Glassman
to text me the answer

31
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,689
as soon as he gets
out of the shower.

32
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,984
Well...what's
Carly's favorite color?

33
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:34,111
'Cause flowers
don't really have meaning.

34
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,863
That's just a tactic
to boost sales.

35
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:38,616
Purple.

36
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,786
There you go.

37
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,478
Hi, Shaun.

38
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,524
I'd like to have sex
tonight.

39
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,735
Would you?

40
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,573
Yes.

41
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,843
39‐year‐old male,
multi‐car accident,

42
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,303
blunt abdominal injuries,

43
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,138
including ruptured spleen
and lacerated liver.

44
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,973
What's his G. C. S.?
Nine.

45
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,058
Intraperitoneal free fluid
in the right upper quadrant.

46
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,101
We need an O. R., stat.

47
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,519
Page Melendez.

48
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,165
We were at
our engagement photoshoot.

49
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,833
I thought
it was just a migraine.

50
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,085
I get them sometimes
with the flashing lights.

51
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,670
Then she started
slurring her words.

52
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,172
I was trying to tell him

53
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,507
that I couldn't feel
or move my left side.

54
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:20,760
The only thing that got me
through was Tony telling me,

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,886
"Okay, it will be."

56
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,515
How long before your symptoms
began to subside?

57
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,017
About half an hour.

58
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,978
By the time we got here,
all I had was a mild headache.

59
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:34,482
I think you had
a transient ischemic attack.

60
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,941
A mini‐stroke.

61
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:37,568
A stroke?
Mini.

62
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,278
Jeanie's 25.

63
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,947
Which is why we'll need
an MRI, cardiac echo, and labs

64
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:45,034
before...
we know for sure.

65
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,411
Melendez:
Cauterize that bleed.

66
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,581
That's it
for the liver.

67
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,416
What's his mean
arterial pressure?

68
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,210
67.

69
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,753
What was that place
with the deviled oysters

70
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,922
you took Dr. Lim to?

71
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,382
Oh, Mia's in town.

72
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,508
As some of you
may be aware,

73
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,967
Dr. Lim and I are
no longer together.

74
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,388
It's called Half Shell.

75
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,139
Downtown, off Second.

76
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,974
Remove the packing.

77
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,147
Look at the aorta.

78
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,692
Likely a laceration
from the accident.

79
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,694
We'll need to dissect
further to determine the
extent of the damage.

80
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,279
B.P.'s skyrocketing.

81
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,531
He's just suffered
massive blood loss.

82
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,366
He's under anesthesia.
He should be hypotensive.

83
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,534
Pulmonary embolism?

84
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,576
Push beta‐blockers.

85
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,412
That‐‐ That'd kill him.

86
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,038
He's tachycardic
and hyperthermic.

87
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:32,790
I think
he must be on something.

88
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,584
MDMA mixed
with anesthesia?

89
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,922
Give him a low dose
of nitroglycerin

90
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,590
and calcium
channel blockers.

91
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:51,559
B.P.'s dropping.

92
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,561
It's working.

93
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,438
Push the full dose.
Close him up.

94
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,982
We're gonna have to
wait for the MDMA to
leave his bloodstream.

95
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,860
We'll get a better look
at the aorta via imaging.

96
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,902
Good call.

97
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,620
I need to use
the restroom.

98
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,873
Hang in there, Jeanie.
Just a couple more minutes.

99
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:24,091
You should ask me
what I'm going to do tonight.

100
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,260
Um...okay.

101
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,554
But just to make it feel

102
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,015
more like
an actual conversation...

103
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,475
Nothing much.

104
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,685
I've got a yoga class and a date
with Ben & Jerry tonight.

105
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,770
How about you, Shaun?

106
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,397
I'm having sex
with Carly.

107
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,398
Whoa.

108
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,941
It's my first time.

109
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,942
Mazel tov.

110
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,611
It took us 22 days
to kiss,

111
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,070
nine more to hold hands ‐‐

112
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,531
although, we don't really
hold hands when we hold hands ‐‐

113
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:51,577
and another six to touch
more than one thing at a time.

114
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,953
But now I'm ready.

115
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,497
That's a lot of foreplay.

116
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,749
I've been reading about
the four stages of arousal ‐‐

117
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,084
Fair warning ‐‐
the first time for most people

118
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:00,753
is kind of awful.

119
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,004
Your first time
was awful?

120
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,925
Not an appropriate question
to ask a colleague.

121
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:11,972
Although, there's an exception
to every rule.

122
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:16,060
Which books did your lover
read to prepare?

123
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,068
No clots, no bleeds,
no occlusions, no P. F. O.

124
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,903
W‐‐

125
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,154
She didn't have
a stroke.

126
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,783
She's having a seizure.

127
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,291
Pushing diazepam.

128
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,465
She had to use
the restroom.

129
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,303
Her bladder is distended.

130
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,139
Whatever it's pressing against
must be causing these attacks.

131
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:58,852
CT shows
she has two pelvic lesions,

132
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:01,564
and labs show elevated levels
of catecholamines.

133
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,816
The pain meds we gave her could
have distended her bladder,

134
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,192
which is abutting
one of the tumors,

135
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,111
setting off
her second attack.

136
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,529
But what set off
the first one?

137
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,698
Sexual intercourse.

138
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,826
The other tumor appears
to be within her clitoris.

139
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,371
Progressive impact may have
destabilized it over time.

140
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,499
And now she's at risk
of having more seizures.

141
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,920
Sex could kill this woman.

142
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,677
He's stable, and the MDMA
is out of his system.

143
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,388
We're good to go back in
and graft the aorta.

144
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,223
We're just getting caught up
with blood loss

145
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,725
and fluid resuscitation.

146
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,269
An endovascular stent
is minimally invasive.

147
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,062
It is a better option
than a graft.

148
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:44,440
But a stent could clot off
because we won't be able
to give blood thinners.

149
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,108
His liver is still
a bleeding risk.

150
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,736
Let's take our chances
with the stent.

151
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,654
We can be in and out
and have him back in the ICU,

152
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,990
where we can focus
on his recovery.

153
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,992
I do not want to proceed
without consent.

154
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,953
He won't regain consciousness
for another couple of hours.

155
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,872
We shouldn't wait
that long.

156
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,291
Get it from his wife.
She's on her way here now.

157
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,213
We can remove
the tumors,

158
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,049
but it means
we also have to remove

159
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,884
most of your vagina
and clitoris.

160
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,970
You can still
have children.

161
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,932
Via C‐section. It won't affect
your uterus or ovaries.

162
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,061
What about sex?

163
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,647
You won't be able
to have intercourse

164
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,357
or experience an orgasm.

165
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,486
I‐It doesn't make sense.

166
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,780
I've been sexually active
for five years.

167
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,281
Never had any attacks.

168
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:37,117
We suspect the tumor's
been dormant for some time.

169
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:42,373
What if I don't have
the surgery?

170
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,999
What are the odds
of another attack?

171
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,585
There are many variables
involved,

172
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:49,421
including frequency, duration,
sexual position, penis size ‐‐

173
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,965
About 2%.

174
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,091
Each time?

175
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,300
Each time.

176
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,222
On average, couples have sex
52 times per year,

177
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,099
which means
in the next three years,

178
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,059
your chance of having
a life‐threatening attack

179
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,396
is well over 95%.

180
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,323
I think
we'll take our chances.

181
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:20,661
Morgan: You should talk it over
between yourselves,

182
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,870
perhaps
with a counselor ‐‐

183
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,415
I understand
the situation.

184
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,417
I don't want the surgery.

185
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,140
I'll catch up.

186
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,268
Hey.

187
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,269
Hey.

188
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,563
Missed you
at the research meeting.

189
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,023
I was in surgery.
Craniotomy.

190
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,360
Now I have two consults,
a meeting with a donor,

191
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,070
and a hospital chair
meeting.

192
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,780
Well, don't forget
to eat something.

193
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,865
Ah, food is for the weak.

194
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,785
So is waiting
for this elevator.

195
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,496
Are we okay?

196
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,748
Yeah.

197
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,540
Sorry, I'm just busy.

198
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,508
Park: We're recommending
the stent.

199
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:20,304
It risks clotting, but it's also
less invasive than the graft.

200
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,723
The graft would be
a more permanent repair,

201
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,392
but there's greater chance
of surgical complications.

202
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,606
I have to trust you,
right?

203
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,530
Is Dad gonna be okay?

204
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,240
Oh, absolutely, darling.

205
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,578
We're gonna take good care
of your dad.

206
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,497
He'll be home
before you know it, okay?

207
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,831
Okay.

208
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,543
Thank you.

209
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,923
If we send her home
without the surgery, she'll die.

210
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,508
We don't know that.

211
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,928
And taking away sex
from a young couple in love?

212
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,472
That's devastating.

213
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,349
So's death.

214
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,851
How much time does a couple
actually spend having sex?

215
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:11,063
19 minutes per week,
including foreplay.

216
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,818
The rest ‐‐
that's the real relationship.

217
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,320
Forget the act itself.

218
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,988
Sex is crucial
to the happiness

219
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:21,907
and satisfaction
of a relationship.

220
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,909
Sex is destructive.

221
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,162
It turns people into liars
and cheaters and idiots.

222
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:28,539
It might start
relationships,

223
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,833
but more often than not,
it rips them apart.

224
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,668
She got devastating news

225
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,337
and made an emotional decision
without thinking it through.

226
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,631
The least we can do
is get her counseling.

227
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,134
Was she offered counseling
when you gave her the diagnosis?

228
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,635
Briefly, but she was still
reeling from the ‐‐

229
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,970
Then it's over.

230
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,513
When she's stable,
discharge her.

231
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,347
Thank you.

232
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:55,522
Yeah, the pink heart
and purple star...

233
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:57,149
How are you feeling?

234
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:59,360
Hi, Doctor.
He's doing great.

235
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,945
Hi.
I'm Dr. Browne.

236
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:03,322
You had a tear
in your aorta,

237
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:05,074
but we stabilized it
with a stent.

238
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:09,370
Until we can give you
blood thinners,

239
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,955
you'll be at risk
of a clot,

240
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:13,749
so we'll be
monitoring you closely.

241
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:17,086
But right now, everything is
looking absolutely perfect.

242
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:18,128
Oh!

243
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:19,630
Gentle.

244
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:22,716
See, Cupcake?

245
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,718
It's all good.

246
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:26,971
Why didn't you come home
last night?

247
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:29,223
Daddy had a sleepover
at Uncle Jeff's.

248
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:31,892
He got a new turtle.
You can see it next time.

249
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:43,153
Your blood pressure
is responding well

250
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:44,488
to the alpha‐blockers.

251
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:45,989
We'll run labs.

252
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:47,449
If they're normal, you can be
discharged in the morning.

253
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:48,617
Thank you.

254
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,789
You'll want to be aware
at all times

255
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,666
of where
the closest hospital is.

256
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,962
Every time
you have intercourse,

257
00:13:59,962 --> 00:14:01,880
you'll be endangering
your fiancée's life.

258
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,842
I‐I'm aware of that.

259
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:06,885
We both are.

260
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,929
But it's Jeanie's body.
It's her decision.

261
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:11,432
I'm just...trying
to be supportive.

262
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:12,766
I don't think you are.

263
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:14,601
You're being selfish.

264
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:15,686
She's risking her life,

265
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:17,104
and you're keeping
your mouth shut

266
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:18,272
so you can keep
getting laid.

267
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:22,860
You do think I'm making
the right decision?

268
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:26,864
Yes.

269
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:27,990
I do.

270
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,752
Thanks.

271
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:49,011
He really is
gonna be fine.

272
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:50,596
I know. Thank you.

273
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:53,432
You okay?

274
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,980
I think
he's cheating on me.

275
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,357
His brother lives
in Willow Glen,

276
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:05,861
the other side of the city
from where he had his accident.

277
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,280
What did he say
about it?

278
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,075
That he had a breakfast meeting
with a client.

279
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:14,912
Not unlike the excuse he used
last time he cheated.

280
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:19,917
Him denying it
was the worst part.

281
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,919
Made me doubt myself.

282
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,506
You know, was I just
a paranoid, jealous wife,

283
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:27,132
throwing out
wild accusations?

284
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:36,934
Your husband has just had
a serious car accident,

285
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,144
and you're very stressed.

286
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,690
Right now, all you should be
thinking about is...

287
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,983
getting him better.

288
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,321
You're right.

289
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:53,742
Thank you.

290
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:55,160
Not at all.

291
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:02,709
Would you like
to take my top off?

292
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,670
Yes.

293
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:20,143
Would you like me
to take your shirt off?

294
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:22,187
No.

295
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:25,065
I would like
to do it myself.

296
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:26,525
Even better.

297
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:41,957
Okay.

298
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,918
I've got it.

299
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:51,717
I‐I got it.
Okay.

300
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,317
Mm.

301
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:09,443
Do you want to slow down?

302
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,322
Do you want to stop?

303
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:22,456
I'd like
to go watch some TV.

304
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,682
So, eh,
you weren't feeling it?

305
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:47,475
I was definitely
feeling it.

306
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:49,102
She ‐‐ Mm.

307
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,812
I don't know.

308
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:52,355
I think you're confused.

309
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:54,190
I think ‐‐
I think it's emotional

310
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,983
and it's hormonal,
and ‐‐ and ‐‐ and maybe ‐‐

311
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:57,652
I wasn't confused.

312
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,613
She had a tattoo.

313
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,573
It was half a heart.

314
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:05,118
I don't understand why someone
would get an incomplete tattoo.

315
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,078
She shouldn't have something
that's incomplete

316
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:09,288
on her body
that I can see.

317
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,629
You sure
it was the tattoo?

318
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:17,380
Yes.

319
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,173
It is a...

320
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:23,719
very disturbing tattoo
that makes no sense.

321
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:26,556
Maybe it's not
about the tattoo.

322
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,141
I mean...

323
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,935
maybe it's about intimacy?

324
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:34,356
Letting another person into
your life ‐‐ that's a big deal.

325
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:36,566
I know. Trust me.

326
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,027
There are gonna be things
about her that you love

327
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:43,532
and things about her
that  you don't.

328
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,992
And there are certain things,
like the tattoo,

329
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,120
you ‐‐ you can't change.

330
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,706
Because...

331
00:18:50,706 --> 00:18:53,083
because...

332
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,584
well, it's worth it.

333
00:18:57,713 --> 00:19:00,424
She can get
the tattoo removed.

334
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:03,301
She can't get
the tattoo removed, Shaun.

335
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,762
I don't think
it's about the tattoo.

336
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:09,599
We are backed up.

337
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,600
Sorry, Shaun.

338
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:18,108
Okay.

339
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,738
Carly:
Everything looks good.

340
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:25,157
Could've just checked them
on the E. M. R.

341
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:26,366
I know.

342
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,576
How's it going
with Shaun?

343
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:31,496
He tends to overshare
with coworkers.

344
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:32,748
Yes, he does.

345
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:35,083
And he was oversharing
up until this morning,

346
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,544
so I'm guessing
the Night of a Thousand Stars

347
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,212
didn't go as planned?

348
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,173
We're fine, thanks.

349
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:42,883
Of course.

350
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:45,802
You waited three weeks
for a kiss. You're a saint.

351
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:47,512
That didn't sound
like a compliment.

352
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:51,975
I like Shaun,
and I love that he's dating,

353
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,560
but I can't help thinking

354
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,353
that the kind of person
who'd go out with Shaun

355
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:58,106
might be seeing him
more as a project than a person.

356
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:00,358
And I'd rather not see him
get his heart broken.

357
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:06,573
Last week,
two techs called in sick.

358
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,993
I had to diagnose and file
over 200 slides.

359
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:11,453
But when I told Shaun,

360
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:13,205
he came down and he helped me
get through them

361
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:14,414
until 3:00
in the morning.

362
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:20,545
I am not going out with Shaun
because I have a martyr complex.

363
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:21,963
I'm going out with him
'cause he's a great guy

364
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:24,049
who treats me well.

365
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,092
And the condescending notion
that someone needs

366
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:29,346
an ulterior motive
to be interested in him

367
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:32,682
means you're the one who isn't
seeing him as a person.

368
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:47,948
Your craniotomy ended an hour
before the research meeting.

369
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,950
You didn't miss the meeting
'cause you were in surgery.

370
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,868
I think you missed the meeting
because I was gonna be there.

371
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:54,996
I'm busy. I can show you
my calendar if you'd like.

372
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:57,207
You dumped me. I should be
the one avoiding you.

373
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:58,333
What's going on?

374
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:01,628
Are you having
second thoughts?

375
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,630
No. I'm not.

376
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,181
Why are you willing to die
for sex?

377
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,730
Sex creates...

378
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,149
vulnerability,

379
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,277
lets you be open,

380
00:21:25,277 --> 00:21:28,071
honest with each other,

381
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:30,282
share your biggest fears.

382
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:33,368
Sometimes,
you shouldn't share.

383
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:36,037
Sometimes, you have to
just accept, right?

384
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:38,123
Wrong.

385
00:21:38,123 --> 00:21:41,126
What you have to accept, that's
not for anyone else to say.

386
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,047
If you don't tell your partner
everything that you're feeling,

387
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:49,426
thinking, worrying about,

388
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:53,471
then you aren't
fully connected.

389
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,814
Close your eyes.

390
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:05,358
Yes, this is one of those
dumb sensory exercises,

391
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,568
but just go with it.

392
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:15,368
Now tell me one of your favorite
memories with your fiancée.

393
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:21,333
Last summer,
we went camping in Yosemite.

394
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,001
We decided to rough it

395
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:25,795
by only packing
PB&J sandwiches.

396
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:28,006
The first night,
a bear rips into our tent

397
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:29,674
and devours them.

398
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,885
And the next night, of course,
we had this hole in our tent,

399
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:35,805
and the mosquitos
just ate us alive.

400
00:22:37,432 --> 00:22:40,685
And the bug spray
that we thought we packed?

401
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:42,020
It was sunscreen.

402
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,022
And then
when it started pouring,

403
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:47,734
we turned to each other
at the same time and we said,

404
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,361
"Denny's."

405
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:52,989
And that's when I knew
I wanted to marry her.

406
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:53,865
Great.

407
00:22:56,701 --> 00:23:00,038
That was a memory of something
you got through together,

408
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:02,248
not about the time
you had a threesome in Miami.

409
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,001
It was New Orleans.

410
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:08,546
The threesome was
in New Orleans, not Miami.

411
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:11,091
And it was way better
than the bear trip.

412
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:15,720
But I wasn't gonna tell
my fiancée's doctor about it.

413
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,015
Sex...makes you real
with someone.

414
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:20,141
Sex makes you stupid.

415
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:25,271
I had the perfect man.

416
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:29,651
He was...smart
and funny.

417
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,278
He squeezed the sponge
after washing the dishes.

418
00:23:36,074 --> 00:23:39,744
Then one night, I‐I met some guy
and I had a few drinks,

419
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:41,663
and, um...

420
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:44,749
I got all tingly
and got really stupid.

421
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:46,418
Never saw him again.

422
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:49,838
Or my boyfriend.

423
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:56,302
Sex can make us feel
incredibly close to someone ‐‐

424
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,513
honest,

425
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:00,015
vulnerable.

426
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:06,813
But sex is not the goal.

427
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:09,858
All the rest
of those things are.

428
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:16,448
She's the love
of my life.

429
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:18,742
And I always thought
that we were strong

430
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:21,161
and that we can overcome
anything together.

431
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:25,123
But without sex...

432
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,794
...I don't know if...

433
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:31,337
if we have enough.

434
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:36,217
Okay.

435
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:41,973
Then you need to lie
to her.

436
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:48,521
Nurse said you'd be here
an hour ago.

437
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:51,191
Yeah, well,
you're not my only patient.

438
00:24:52,984 --> 00:24:54,444
Look, I get it.

439
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:57,238
This is about as awkward
as it gets.

440
00:24:58,531 --> 00:24:59,783
Yes, it is.

441
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:04,287
You know, I almost died
in that accident.

442
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:12,420
When I woke up, all I could
think about was my wife...

443
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,839
and my little girl...

444
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,675
and how much of an ass I'd been
and how hurt they'd be.

445
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:22,305
So, why is it
that once I get out of here,

446
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:25,225
I'm gonna keep cheating
on them?

447
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:27,644
I can't help it.

448
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:31,856
No matter how much remorse
or guilt...

449
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:34,317
I feel like I always give in.

450
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:35,568
Then you should
leave them.

451
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,362
I can't.

452
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:38,446
I love them.

453
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:43,076
How messed up is that,
right?

454
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,542
But I think you know.

455
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:52,961
Yeah, well,
I don't cheat.

456
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:55,630
I saw you checking me out
in the bar.

457
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,215
My left hand,

458
00:25:57,215 --> 00:26:00,635
just making sure
I was married.

459
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:07,851
You're just as big a cheater
as me, Dr. Browne.

460
00:26:12,814 --> 00:26:15,400
My, uh, leg...

461
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,609
it's ‐‐ it's cold.

462
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,667
No pulse.

463
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,960
Your stent has formed
a clot.

464
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,752
We need an angio, stat!

465
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:40,299
Everything okay?

466
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,634
You haven't said a word
since "Pass the salt."

467
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,471
It's about Shaun,
isn't it?

468
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:52,226
Two weeks ago,

469
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:54,979
you asked me to give him
romantic advice,

470
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,564
which I didn't want
to do.

471
00:26:56,564 --> 00:26:59,317
And then he comes into my office
for romantic advice,

472
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,860
and you kick him right out.

473
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,946
It's because
you're helping him too much.

474
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:04,697
He is completely dependent
on you.

475
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:06,032
For good reason.

476
00:27:06,032 --> 00:27:08,201
He hasn't spoken to his parents
since he was 14.

477
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,078
The only person
he cared about...

478
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:12,372
died right in front
of his eyes.

479
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:16,501
Aaron, I know
how much you love him.

480
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:20,338
How you hate to see him
struggle, fail, get hurt.

481
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:24,133
But you need to let him.

482
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:26,594
And he'll be okay.

483
00:27:26,594 --> 00:27:29,889
Because he has someone else
in his life now.

484
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,641
Just like you do.

485
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:39,524
Placing guide wire
through the needle.

486
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:40,650
Placing catheter.

487
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,779
So, how do you know
this guy?

488
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:46,280
You knew he was on MDMA,

489
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,949
you've been avoiding him
since he arrived,

490
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:50,576
and...I checked
on his accident.

491
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:52,120
It was a half mile
from your place.

492
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,457
I was with him
the night before the accident,

493
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:57,667
but it's not relevant.

494
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,168
It hasn't affected
my judgement.

495
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:00,503
Yes, it has.

496
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:02,046
If you hadn't been
avoiding him,

497
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:03,423
we could've
caught the clot earlier.

498
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,303
I figure you've been
going through something lately.

499
00:28:10,763 --> 00:28:12,140
Something
that's really hurt you.

500
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:17,437
And maybe it's making you turn
to things you normally wouldn't.

501
00:28:18,855 --> 00:28:20,606
But some of the guys you meet
are gonna be trouble,

502
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:22,108
some are gonna be married,
some are gonna ‐‐

503
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:23,776
He took a vow, not me.

504
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:30,783
That's the exact attitude
someone had

505
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:32,201
when they helped
ruin my life.

506
00:28:33,703 --> 00:28:34,871
There's the clot.

507
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,834
Activating angio jet.

508
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:44,130
It's too big to bust.

509
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,423
We have to open him up.

510
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,178
You said to accept things
I don't like, but Jeanie said

511
00:28:50,178 --> 00:28:52,221
I have to share everything,
and I don't know ‐‐
Shaun. Shaun.

512
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:53,765
Shaun,
stop, stop, stop.

513
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,477
I have to go home.

514
00:28:57,477 --> 00:29:00,480
I can walk you to your car.
Is it very far?

515
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,732
I think this discussion
will take at least 15 minutes,

516
00:29:02,732 --> 00:29:04,275
so maybe you can drive me?

517
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,902
We have to
set boundaries, okay?

518
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:07,487
We have to set
some limits.

519
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:10,156
You can't just come over
6:30 in the morning,

520
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:11,908
uh, uh, for flower advice.

521
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:14,202
You can't just pop into
my office anytime you want.

522
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:15,536
Is this because of Debbie?

523
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:16,287
No.

524
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,079
Yes.

525
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,837
And I agree with her.

526
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:26,881
It was different when it was
just the two of us,

527
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,758
but now we have people
in our lives ‐‐

528
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,510
both of us.

529
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,178
We have to make them
the priority.

530
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:37,558
Does this mean
we can't talk anymore?

531
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:39,727
No, of course we can talk.
Of ‐‐

532
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,356
It's just that there's a time
and a place for everything.

533
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:46,651
And this is
the wrong time and place?

534
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:54,283
Yeah.

535
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:05,002
7:00 a. m. Tuesday.
Pancakes.

536
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:11,050
I liked it better

537
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,719
when it was
just the two of us.

538
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:24,981
125 over 78.

539
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:26,482
Looks good.

540
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,623
Nice bug spray.

541
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:45,084
SPF 50.

542
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:46,627
Not much went right
that trip.

543
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:51,048
But...

544
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:54,927
the more things went wrong,

545
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:56,512
the closer I felt to you.

546
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,516
We'll get through this,
too.

547
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:07,565
I don't know.

548
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,445
Sex has always been...

549
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:13,571
our language.

550
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:19,160
Our way of sharing who we are
with each other.

551
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,828
And if we lose that...

552
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:25,708
...what if
we don't have enough?

553
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:29,086
We'll still have...

554
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:31,213
honesty,

555
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:32,882
intimacy,

556
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:34,884
love,

557
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:36,594
three kids.

558
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,845
Two boys and a girl.

559
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,105
I love you more than sex.

560
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,776
I love you
more than sex, too.

561
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:09,543
Does...this mean
you're getting the surgery?

562
00:32:11,754 --> 00:32:13,214
Yeah.

563
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:20,054
Park: 90 minutes
without a pulse in his leg.

564
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:21,389
He's at high risk
for necrosis.

565
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,307
Prosthetic successfully
sutured to aorta.

566
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,309
Almost done with
the distal right anastomosis.

567
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:27,228
Careful not to narrow the artery
during suturing.

568
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:28,396
Mm‐hmm.

569
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,167
Blood flow restored.
Good arterial pulse.

570
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,044
Good job catching that clot,
Dr. Browne.

571
00:32:52,044 --> 00:32:53,963
If we'd waited any longer,
we'd have to amputate.

572
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:56,632
Thank you.

573
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:59,176
It...was a team effort.

574
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,307
Andrews: Making incision
at the vaginal wall.

575
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:07,143
Murphy, develop margins
at the lesion.

576
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:08,310
Shaun: Forceps.

577
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,104
Nicely done.

578
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,314
How you turned your patient
around.

579
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:14,483
It was nice
when Tony told Jeanie

580
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:15,943
he loved her
more than sex.

581
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,988
He was lying.

582
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:22,783
I told him that if he cared
about her at all, he had to.

583
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:25,870
Maybe it was the truth.

584
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:32,001
It can be true
without him knowing it's true.

585
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:50,853
What's wrong?

586
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,192
Dr. Glassman told me
I have to accept things,

587
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:58,694
but Jeanie said
to be open and honest.

588
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:00,654
I agree with Jeanie ‐‐

589
00:34:00,654 --> 00:34:02,823
whoever she is.

590
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:04,742
It's your tattoo.

591
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,118
Thank God.

592
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:08,037
I thought you hated my boobs
or something.

593
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:09,163
It's incomplete.

594
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,875
Didn't you have enough money
to pay for a full heart?

595
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:16,253
I got this in high school.

596
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:17,463
It's incomplete.

597
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,144
Not anymore.

598
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:35,940
I got you.

599
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:00,589
Shaun?

600
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,219
Dr. Glassman was right.

601
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,138
It's not the tattoo.

602
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:25,489
We were able to restore
blood flow to his legs.

603
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:26,615
He's gonna be just fine.

604
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:29,618
Thank you so much,
Dr. Browne.

605
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,582
Now that
he's out of the woods,

606
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:37,960
you don't need to feel guilty
about questioning him.

607
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,881
All the pain, paranoia,
and self‐doubt...

608
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:44,508
you deserve
to know the truth.

609
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:45,968
He's just gonna deny it.

610
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:50,473
Then you need to insist.

611
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:13,204
Our relationship
was a stupid idea.

612
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,498
Which made ending it
a smart idea.

613
00:36:15,498 --> 00:36:17,875
Simple, binary...

614
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,043
and naive.

615
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:25,508
I really underestimated
how hard this would be.

616
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:32,723
Yes, I've been having
second thoughts.

617
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,558
I'm not saying we should
get back together ‐‐

618
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:35,935
What are you saying?

619
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:40,481
I don't know.

620
00:36:42,107 --> 00:36:43,192
Good.

621
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:49,823
It's...good to know
that it's not easy.

622
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,494
It's good to know
that it mattered.

623
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:10,177
Intimacy isn't
about a tattoo.

624
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:13,430
And it's not about
touching or kissing

625
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,267
or...even sex.

626
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:22,690
It's about sharing
your biggest fears.

627
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,693
Yes.

628
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:29,697
What are you scared of?

629
00:37:32,992 --> 00:37:35,578
I love
being a pathologist.

630
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:40,541
But every day
I walk into the lab,

631
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:43,085
I am filled with doubt.

632
00:37:43,085 --> 00:37:45,337
Am I smart enough?
Am I capable enough?

633
00:37:45,337 --> 00:37:48,591
Do I really deserve
to be here?

634
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:52,845
How long until someone walks in
and exposes my fraud

635
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:55,097
and has me removed
from the premises?

636
00:37:56,515 --> 00:38:00,060
Eventually,
those thoughts retreat.

637
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,395
Until the next morning,

638
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:03,897
when they all come crashing
back into my brain.

639
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:09,612
That and pigeons.

640
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:11,822
They freak me out.

641
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,449
Hmm.

642
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,080
My biggest fear...

643
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:25,210
...is that I'll be alone.

644
00:38:28,964 --> 00:38:32,217
If I don't get over this,
you'll leave.

645
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:02,915
We don't
have to have sex.

646
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:09,588
Can we just hold each other
for a little bit?

647
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,178
I think I'd like that.

648
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:56,635
Shaun?

649
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,690
Sash...

650
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,733
Sash!

651
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:33,005
You should go.

652
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:36,133
I don't know. Maybe.

653
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,886
It can wait
till tomorrow morning.

654
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:42,264
Eh, you were right.

655
00:40:42,264 --> 00:40:44,600
Everything you said
was right.

656
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,019
But this is different.

657
00:40:49,688 --> 00:40:51,148
Shaun needs you.

658
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:00,384
Hey.

659
00:42:08,517 --> 00:42:10,477
Your mom called
from Wyoming.

660
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:16,066
Your dad's been diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer.

661
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,235
He may only have
a few days left.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
