1
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,080
- Good morning, Benjamín.
- Good morning, Your Highness. Welcome.

2
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,120
- If you would come with me.
- I'll see you later, okay?

3
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,360
ARI, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REACT.

4
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,240
SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE LAKE CLUB.

5
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
ARI IS TYPING...

6
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,040
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THE LAKE CLUB? DEBATE?

7
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
I'D RATHER MEET OUTSIDE SCHOOL SO WE CAN
TAKE OUR TIME PREPARING OUR ARGUMENT.

8
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,120
A school full of girls from good families,

9
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,520
all waiting for my son to look at them,

10
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,240
and he falls for the janitor?

11
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
She wants to be a fashion designer.

12
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
She's a very bright and intelligent girl.

13
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,720
I know that sort of intelligence.

14
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,960
I've seen it in all the other
Little Miss Nobodies after him.

15
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,720
Cayetana will behave
and stick to the path set for her.

16
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,080
How do you know that?

17
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,800
She has shown unconditional support
for her boyfriends before.

18
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,320
She'll be with him no matter what.

19
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,800
She has everything to gain.

20
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,320
You'll throw a New Year's Eve party.

21
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,280
The media will be there,
and there'll be a photo shoot.

22
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,520
I want you to invite all your friends.

23
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,280
You can bring that girl if you want.

24
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Cayetana.

25
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,960
So, Benjamín filled you in.

26
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,440
Do you really like her?

27
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Very much.

28
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,520
Have you at least given
other girls a chance?

29
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,680
I don't want other girls.

30
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,880
I want her.

31
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Fine, you'll introduce her formally
at the party.

32
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,920
That's part of your campaign
to clean up my image, right?

33
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,680
We're not together right now.

34
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,160
You mean you can't win
your peasant girl back?

35
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,720
Don't call her that.

36
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,600
Do you want her back or not?

37
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Yes, Mom.

38
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,840
Well then, do what you need to do.

39
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,960
What's happened to you here in Madrid?

40
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,520
I don't recognize you anymore.

41
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,400
I WANT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT

42
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,840
WHAT TIME SHOULD WE GO TO THE HOTEL?

43
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,840
I'M SORRY, REBE. I CAN'T GO.

44
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,840
I'M SORRY, REBE. I CAN'T GO.

45
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,920
I WANT TO START THE YEAR WITH YOU.
PHILLIPE

46
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,640
BEFORE I GO: MOM, GUZMÁN, OMAR

47
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,920
Shit.
