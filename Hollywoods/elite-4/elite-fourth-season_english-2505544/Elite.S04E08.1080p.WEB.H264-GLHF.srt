00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,880
Tell me again what her message was.

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,320
"Is that all you have to tell me,
as though last night never happened?"

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,560
So, you still smelled of her, you bastard.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,080
- Guzmán!
- Let me tell you something.

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,760
You're a goddamn liar.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,320
You pretend that you're a good dude,
that you're my friend,

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,520
but, of course, you have no goddamn idea
what being a friend means, do you?

Guzmán. Guzmán. Guzmán!

Look, this isn't a competition for me
or just a fucking whim, okay?

- I'm finally gonna read it.
- I only gave it to you a year ago, man.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,640
Sure, but now I'll finally have time.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
You know what?
I think I might go with you.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
You serious?

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,160
I don't know why I'm here, honestly.

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,280
You shouldn't have stayed this long.
You should've left when you wanted.

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,480
Well, I had my reasons.

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,480
- That one-track mind.
- Such a dipshit.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,640
I love seein' the two of you together.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,280
Even if it's to say goodbye.

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,600
You're telling the principal
and your classmates today?

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,720
Yeah.

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,040
You're leaving halfway through the year?
Can't you wait until the summer?

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
But this summer,
who knows where I'll be? Life's short.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Ander. Oh.

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, enough. Stop. C'mon.
You said you'd be supportive.

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,040
Of course I am. But let me have my moment
to play the suffering mother.

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,440
C'mon. Off you go.

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,520
- Ciao.
- See ya.

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,120
BEFORE I GO: OMAR

51
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,720
Yeah. She really is pretty.

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,400
To be honest, this year,
I'm really looking forward to a vacation.

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,600
I've always liked
spending time with my family.

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,200
- For the holidays, we're gonna go away...
- Ari? Ari, I need to talk to you.

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Me? About what?

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,680
Your sister won't listen to me,
but I thought you would.

57
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
So, you're trying to solve
your personal issues

58
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
with me as the middleman?

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,520
Merry Christmas, Rebeka.

60
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
I need your help.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
I'll be right back.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,440
Look, hon, my best advice
is that you forget about my sister.

63
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,600
You can avoid some sleepless nights,
I assure you.

64
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,640
Great, so she has to stay
with that sleazy old man

65
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,840
because you won't help her?

66
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
What old man? Armando?

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,800
Sweetheart, Armando and her
are just friends. Why are you interfering?

68
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,520
Are you crazy or just jealous?

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,200
Yeah, they're great pals.
Did she tell you how they first met?

70
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,336
- Having drinks, you mean?
- Expensive drinks.

71
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
Maybe too expensive.

72
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,480
What?

73
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,320
Look, Ari,
I'm not telling you this about Mencía

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,360
out of spite or to try to get her back,

75
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,160
'cause I know this means
I'll probably lose her forever.

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm telling this to you
in case you can help her,

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
'cause she won't let me.

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,720
- Just one second...
- No. Get out.

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
- But... But let me...
- I said no. Don't. You're too close.

80
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,920
Let me explain myself.

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Outside, where there are cameras.
You're a fan of those, aren't you?

82
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,640
I had no intention of upsetting you, okay?

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
We were partying,
and we had a lot to drink, you know?

84
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,160
Yeah. And that's no excuse, Phillipe.

85
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,280
Cayetana, come on.
Don't act like it's so surprising

86
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
I misinterpreted your signals.

87
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,320
Exactly which signals
did you misinterpret?

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,520
Because I sent plenty,
and none of them were mixed.

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
I don't know,
but we were making out, and...

90
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
And I told you the fact
that we were making out is no excuse.

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,040
I told you no more than once, Phillipe.

92
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,280
Would <i>those </i>be the signals
you might have misinterpreted?

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Because you only got the picture
when I bolted out of your limousine.

94
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,520
Caye...

95
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,560
I really am sorry.

97
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,800
Fuck no. Just fucking ignore her.

98
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,440
She made all this up
because she's upset with me. That's all.

99
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,000
She's upset, but I don't see her
pulling this out of thin air.

100
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Ari, please. Just ignore her.

101
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,120
Mencía, are you sure?

102
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,080
Get your nose
out of my business, all right?

103
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,680
Mencía.

104
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,600
Babe, listen.

105
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,200
Um, whatever might be going on
with Armando or whoever it is...

106
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,720
It's <i>my </i>fucking problem,
and I can handle my own shit.

107
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,840
Stop, Mencía, you say that all the time.

108
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,640
And in the end, all you accomplish
is leave a mess in your wake

109
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,880
the rest of us get stuck taking care of.

110
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,240
Trust your family a bit more.
Give us some damn credit.

111
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,640
- Maybe we should tell Dad about it.
- No way.

112
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,376
For once, can you stop being mad
at Dad and everyone else?

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
No, not a fucking word to Benjamín.
I mean it.

114
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,016
Do you not realize Dad can fix any problem
with the snap of a finger?

115
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,280
I said no, Ari!

116
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,880
Not a thing to him, Patrick, any of them.

117
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,840
I'm dead serious right now, Ari.
If you say a single word to Benjamín,

118
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,320
I promise you'll never see me ever again.
Do you fucking understand me?

119
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,200
<i>I've done everything possible
to try to forget about you.</i>

120
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,520
But I realized it's useless
because I can't.

121
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
It's absurd, but I love you.

122
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,840
I can't forgive myself
for giving up on you 'cause I never have.

123
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,640
Not even when I thought you were dying.

124
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,280
So, I'm not gonna start now.

125
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,480
Giving up on you, I mean.

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,920
And if you're open to it,
I'd like to give us another shot.

127
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,000
Ander, what are you thinking?

128
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,240
Look, you almost went
to New York with Malick.

129
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,960
And you stayed here because of me.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,080
Don't you wonder where you'd be
if only you'd been true to yourself?

131
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,600
Except I didn't stay here for you.
I stayed here for <i>me</i>.

132
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
I can only see a life if it's with you.

133
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,600
I want us to be together.

134
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,360
But if you...
I get it if you don't want that.

135
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,640
I... I won't make a big deal of it
and hold it against you or anything.

136
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,400
I'll respect your answer.

137
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,520
I'd better leave you alone.

138
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
BEFORE I GO: OMAR

139
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Omar, wait.

140
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Come in.

141
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,000
Excuse me. You wanted to see me, sir?

142
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,800
Benjamín, would you give us a moment?

143
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
I know
that you're trying to defend your son.

144
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
No matter what gender theories
or passing fads may say,

145
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,680
every man is naturally born with

146
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,760
a biological type of hardwiring.

147
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,120
And we women have the capacity to tame it.

148
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,960
And that is... a gift.
It's uniquely powerful.

149
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,040
There's no need
to beat your head against a wall,

150
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
trying to change that reality.

151
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,040
Forget about his history
with these girls, Cayetana.

152
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,240
And about any nasty rumors
you may have heard about Phillipe.

153
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,640
Because my son has chosen you.

154
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,160
Above everything.

155
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
And everyone.

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,680
Do you realize how many things
will no longer be a problem

157
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,280
for you or your family?

158
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,680
Countless.

159
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Don't be stupid.

160
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,240
Don't refuse this gift
that life has graciously handed you.

161
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,160
Cayetana,

162
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,160
I would love it if you came
to the New Year's Eve party with Phillipe.

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,080
You mind if I ask you a personal question?

172
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,840
Yeah?

173
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,480
Go for it.

174
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,600
Why'd you reunite?

175
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,120
Well, because we love each other.
I mean, obviously.

176
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,720
But that's not enough, though.

177
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,880
I love my ex a lot.

178
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,200
I mean, he's Ander's dad.
I'll never quit loving him,

179
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,720
but you need to have a shared purpose
in your relationship.

180
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,920
I don't mean a house
with kids running around.

181
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
I'm not that crazy.

182
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,640
But you do have to be on the same page
about what you want.

183
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,080
Wait a minute. I just told you
that we both have a million plans.

184
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,320
- That it's, uh...
- You <i>both </i>have? Or just you?

185
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,640
He's staying again for you.

186
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,000
I didn't force him before,
and I'm not forcing him now.

187
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,800
In fact, I told him that
if he didn't want to get back together,

188
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,960
I'd accept it.

189
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Omar.

190
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
What's the matter?

191
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,520
Wow.

192
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,120
You look great.

Thanks.

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Ah.

227
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,800
Ah. This is your moment.

228
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,760
Be sure to enjoy it.

229
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,720
Excuse me.

Your son's impulsiveness

isn't really a matter of biology,
Your Highness.

232
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,080

What do you intend to do?

242
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,280
I organized this to celebrate
the New Year with my guests.

243
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,880
And Cayetana is my guest in her own right.

244
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,960
As a friend and as a designer.

245
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,040
You are a fool

246
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,880
and an ingrate.

247
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,280
And whose fault is it?

248
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,560
Who raised me this way?

249
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Phillipe...

250
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
I brought you into this world.

251
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,400
I raised you.

252
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,560
I never took my eyes off you,

253
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,480
except when it was better
to look the other way.

254
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,240
Something that happened quite often.

255
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,920
My role has been to love and protect you,
and I have done that impeccably.

256
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,160
If now, all of a sudden,

257
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,600
you want to be an adult
and walk on alone, do it.

258
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,200
Accept the consequences of your choices.

259
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
That's all.

260
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,536
Ari, calm down, girl.
We all know how you get when you drink.

261
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't "get" any way
because I'm barely a drinker.

262
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,480
Well, now we've gone
from "never" to "barely."

263
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,200
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

264
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Go talk to her.

265
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I'll pass.

266
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,720
Then wallow in your pride,
and see how well that works out.

267
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,560
Yeah, spare me the lecture.

268
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,760
You were gonna go travel, and yet again,
you bowed down to Omar.

269
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,320
- Well, I'll go... eventually.
- A little word of advice?

270
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,520
Don't give up things for others,
'cause they won't do the same for you.

271
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,680
Feel me?

272
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,960
Look at Nadia. Chose her future over me.

273
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,600
But I kept pursuing her
like a real dickhead.

274
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,800
What about Ari?

275
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,040
What about Ari?

276
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,520
Honestly, you're still angry
that Nadia prioritized her future

277
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,760
over staying with you.

278
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,600
Whereas Ari wants you in her life,
and you threw that away.

279
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,880
Look, Ari's one thing,
Nadia's another, all right?

280
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,800
Ari loves me and Samuel and the football
and basketball team, probably.

281
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
Okay? They're two different things.

282
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,520
Look, you've told me millions of times

283
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,000
that you'd love a relationship
like the one I have with Omar.

284
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,880
Well, this is how our relationship works.
Compromise, dude. We both have to.

285
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,600
Sure, she fucked up.

286
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,080
But do you really wanna lose Ari...
or Samuel?

287
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,680
I wouldn't wanna lose Omar over that.

288
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,840
Go talk to her. Come on.

289
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Come on.

290
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,840
Thanks a lot, handsome.

291
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
What?

292
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,440
Nothing.

293
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,920
Have a minute?
It's impossible to talk in there.

294
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,520
No, thank you, honestly.

295
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,440
I don't wanna finish the year
with an argument.

296
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,760
One minute. I promise.

297
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,240
This isn't really how I thought
I'd start the year either, you know.

298
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,760
With you and all that.

299
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,520
I never thought you'd fall
for someone like me, if I'm being honest.

300
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,440
Yeah, well... you were clearly mistaken.

301
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,400
<i>Was </i>I mistaken, Ari?

302
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,400
Because that whole routine about
how you can't give me or Guzmán up

303
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,760
was the most cowardly possible way
to try and let either one of us down easy.

304
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,800
I know you love Guzmán.

305
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,560
Admit it. It's not that big a deal.

306
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,120
It makes perfect sense.
He's the rational choice.

307
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,640
But you must leave me alone if you care.

308
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,320
You're used to having
everything you want in life,

309
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
but that's not how it works.

310
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,640
You can't have everything.

311
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
But you gotta stop roping me in.

312
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,480
And don't tempt me every time
you wanna indulge some whim of yours.

313
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,760
Forget all about me.

314
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,080
For me,
it's not worth the damage we've done

315
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,840
and that we'll keep doing together.

316
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,080
Sorry. It's not worth it at all.

317
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,240
WHERE ARE YOU?

318
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
I WANT TO START THE NEW YEAR WITH YOU.

319
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,040
I HAVE PLANS. I'M SORRY.

320
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,880
I KNOW. I'M HERE, IN YOUR PLANS.

321
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,080
All right, party people!
Seven minutes until the end of the year!

322
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,520
Let's go. Come on.

323
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,760
Even on Grindr, we introduce ourselves.

324
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,120
Patrick. A local but raised in London.
Versatile. More submissive.

325
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Coming or not?

326
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,440
<i>I don't know what came over me
or what in the world I was thinking.</i>

327
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,640
<i>I'll meet you in half an hour
at the pier on the lake.</i>

328
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
<i>Please come and hear me out.</i>

329
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
Is it me you're smiling at?

330
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,200
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

331
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,160
Should we end the year right?

332
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,360
Okay, what's the matter? I know you.

333
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,560
You had this plan to see the world.

334
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,000
You did.

335
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,040
And you put that plan
on hold for me twice.

336
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,320
Look, it was just an idea
I was tossing around. That's all.

337
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,760
- Leave.
- But I don't want to.

338
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,480
I'm telling you, please.

339
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,160
Omar, I'm happy here with you.

340
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,440
I know,
and I have no doubts about that.

341
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,560
I'll feel better if you follow your dreams
and get out there.

342
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,160
Yeah. I really mean it.

343
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
If you want me to, I can wait.

344
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,360
We can see people on the side,

345
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
'cause I'm not my sister,
and you're not Guzmán.

346
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm happy if you're happy.

347
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,000
Rebeka,
how do I know you're not lying to me?

348
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,040
I just don't know. I can't be sure
if the thing with Armando's real or not.

349
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,480
If what you told me is true or not.

350
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,200
I have no way of knowing.

351
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,200
What I know for certain
is that Mencía told me

352
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,560
that if I do anything at all to help her,
like tattling to my dad,

353
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,400
she said she'd never see or speak to me.

354
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,480
I told you the truth, Ari.

355
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,000
That goddamn motherfucker.

356
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,480
What's the matter?

357
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,160
The fuck are you doing?

358
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,480
You made your way into my house
and my fucking relationship.

359
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,920
What more could you possibly want?

360
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,560
To spend New Year's Eve with you, Menci.

361
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,560
You don't get to call me Menci.
What's your deal?

362
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,680
You're fucking psychotic!

363
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,080
You better not call me psycho,
you little shit.

364
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,440
Rebe, this is dangerous.

365
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,160
Don't you get it? I always come back.

366
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,200
And if I know you need help,
even if you don't ask, I'll be there. See?

367
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,280
Mencía!

368
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Guzmán.

369
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,160
I'd like to start the year
giving my friend a hug.

370
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,080
Forgive me, man. I swear,
Ari's got nothing to do with this.

371
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,800
<i>Three minutes
until the end of the year!</i>

372
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,040
That's why you were talking with her
by the lake now?

373
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,560
No, all I was doing...

374
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,640
Stop fucking lying to me, Samuel!

375
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,800
I don't care if my sister
won't tell the truth about you.

376
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
The fuck do you want?

377
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm telling my father everything, Armando.

378
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,880
And he'll snap his fingers
and fuck up your life forever.

379
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,920
Because you're a disgusting,
rapey motherfucker.

380
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,680
And you're not gonna be able to fuck up
my sister's life

381
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,640
or anyone else's, because my family
will fuck up yours first.

382
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,760
- I'm gonna call my father.
- What'd you say?

383
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,640
I told you. I'm calling my father.

384
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,120
Give me the phone.

385
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,720
No.

00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,120
Why didn't you wanna see me?

478
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,400

No. It's not that.

485

- No.

486
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,920
That message you sent to Samuel,

487
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,960
that's why I went
to the lake to look for you.

488
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,120
So you could tell me to my face, I guess.

489
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,120
But it's okay.

490
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,360
Forgive me for all the bad moments.

491

509
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,720

511
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,960

512
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Not a trace.

513
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,000
It's as if the earth
just kinda swallowed him up.

514
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,160
Well... maybe it's for the best.

515
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,400
Are you upset about that?

516
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,680
I'm actually more scared
he'll suddenly reappear at any moment.

517
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,920
I'm gonna tell Dad about everything.

518
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,360
Because enough's enough.

519
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,840
It was my fault
we don't have a mom anymore.

520
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,440
It was my fault Patrick almost died.

521
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,520
And it's my fault, again,
that we almost lost you too.

522
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,640
Get that crap outta your head, Mencía.

523
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,280
You're not to blame for any of that.

524
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,880
- Okay?
- All right.

525
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
You know I'm never gonna believe it.

526
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,880
Hey, can you be there with me
when I tell Dad what happened?

527
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,080
Right by your side.
