Did you team up
with his family to bring him here

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,760
and shield him
from the rumors in his country?

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
What rumors?

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
What?

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
Nothing.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,840
Is there something I should know?
Care to maybe enlighten me?

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,600

She's not even here?

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,320
I expressly asked you to make sure
this kind of thing didn't happen.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm sorry, but I can't keep an eye on her

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,440
Benjamín said he'd be here
with his three kids.

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,320
They'll be in my class.

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,280
Don't worry.

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,600
Thanks. I love you.

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,920
Let's talk tomorrow.

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,120
It's a pleasure to meet you in person.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,320
The pleasure is mine. Welcome.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
I'll introduce you to my children.
Patrick.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,936
- Hello. How are you?
- A pleasure.

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,240
- The pleasure's mine.
- Ariadna.

43
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,800
Hello.

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,080
How are you?

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,640
Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,200
Her blood alcohol content
is three milligrams.

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,640
And if she's not used to drinking...

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,000
Did she fall, or did someone push her?

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,720
Well, we actually don't know for sure.

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,360
These first 48 hours will be
the most critical for your daughter.

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,600
Phillipe Florian von Triesenberg

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,440
is the second youngest heir in Europe.

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,640
- He opened <i>le Bal </i>two years ago.
- Wow. Hmm.

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,920
- The debutante ball in Paris.
- Hmm.

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
- You know?
- No.

56
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,760
But above all, I mean, come on.
Isn't he so pretty?

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,000
Not only is he a babe, he's a fashion icon

58
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,360
and a patron
of all the best international designers.

59
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,616
And I bet you didn't know
he's fluent in four languages.

60
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,560
He grew up
in the best boarding schools here,

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,760
in the UK,
and Switzerland, so he's super elegant.

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,680
He's handsome,

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
and he's got royal and commoner,
French and Spanish blood.

64
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,200
It's in his blood.

65
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,680
Let me see if I'm right.

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,120
Are you putting together
some animated fantasy in your head

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,240
where this dude, this <i>Florence</i>,
is gonna make you a famous designer

68
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,520
and give you some kind
of royal happily ever after?

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,400
<i>Florian</i>, not Florence. And no.
I just wanted to share this information.

70
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,120
Great. I'd like to share that you'd
better get your helmet on, Cinderella.

71
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,760
You're in for a head-on collision, kid.

72
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,800
That's why they set up the gate
and the cameras?

73
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
Because this guy's coming to study here?

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,520
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,880
And the measures
aren't gonna stop there either.

76
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,360
Look. A better picture of him.

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,080
- Gee, thanks.
- I'll be right back.

78
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,960
So, this necktie is a choice. Okay.

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
What's goin' on?

80
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,440
You have a minute?

81
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,240
What do you want?

82
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,400
Sweet-talk me into convincing my dad
to remove the cameras?

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
No.

84
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,320
I came to tell you I'm sorry.

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,776
- It wasn't all a game. I promise.
- What part wasn't?

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,720
I really enjoyed
our walk around the reservoir.

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,560
Walk? I remember you calling it a date.

88
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,760
Okay, our date.

89
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,880
So, the date was real, then?

90
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
And what else was real?

91
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,160
- The connection between us.
- Yeah, I thought it was real too.

92
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,240
- The laughs about my guinea pig.
- Your girlfriend?

93
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,400
My girlfriend is very real.

94
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm really sorry.

95
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm gonna let this slide...

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,720
but don't have a connection

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,840
with anyone else
as long as you have a girlfriend.

98
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
Okay?

99
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Okay.

100
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,400
It's a deal.

101
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,360
Hey, there's been a weird vibe
between you and Ari ever since the date.

102
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,160
Flirty banter at the pool, talking alone,

103
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,456
staring deep into each other's eyes.
It's all a little...

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,560
We had a misunderstanding,
but that's cleared up.

105
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,560
Aren't you going to try
to get together with her?

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,920
Samuel, I have a girlfriend.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,560
- Oh, all right. Wasn't sure there.
- What's the matter? You into her?

108
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,720
Who, me? No way. Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hit on her or anything.

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Oh, okay, all right.

110
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,520
"Oh, okay, all right," what?

111
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,200
Would you lose it
if I did make a move on her?

112
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,400
No, I don't give a shit.

113
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,216
- Good, 'cause you have a girlfriend.
- Yeah.

114
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
- But I'm saying this for you, not for me.
- What?

115
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,400
I say this as a friend.
You're out of your league with her.

116
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,960
Oh, I see what you're doing.

117
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,176
You're either jealous, or you've gone back
to being the classist prick you were.

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,280
Look, I'm saying this
to protect you, okay?

119
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,480
I know you got a taste of a marquise,
but be real,

120
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,640
Carla was the best you're gonna do.

121
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,360
Ari isn't just out of your orbit.
She's fucking Pluto.

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,200
You're Earth. Understand?

123
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,360
- Like fucking Pluto, huh?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,400
Okay.

125
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,640
Come on. Don't be pissed at me.

126
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,080
Where were you last night?

127
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Out.

128
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,800
Can I at least ask who with?

129
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,320
A friend of mine.

130
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,440
Okay. Which friend?

131
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,840
Benjamín, I'm leaving.

132
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,080
Otherwise, I'll be late for class,
and you'll get upset with me.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,080
Mencía. Mencía!

134
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Uh, excuse me.

135
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Yes?

136
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,840
It's saying, "Criminal record"?

137
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,320
Which part don't you understand,
"criminal" or "record"?

138
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,600
Because they're both
pretty common words, Parrilla.

139
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,840
No, I got that part.

140
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,760
What I don't understand
is why they're asking about our personal

141
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,200
and immediate family's records.

142
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,720
Isn't that private information?

143
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,920
Hmm. Actually,
in your case and your mother's case,

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,480
that info's public and well known.

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,320
You can leave it blank.

146
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,080
The Principality of Triesen

147
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,320
is asking for information
about their heir's classmates, not me.

148
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,120
Though it doesn't seem unreasonable
that they would want to assess

149
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,600
who is taking classes
and sharing this space with him.

150
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Right?

151
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Rebe.

152
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Are you all right?

153
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Fuckin' peachy.

154
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,280
Come on.
Stop stressing yourself out about it.

155
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
Are you serious right now?
He's kicking people out.

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
That's not exactly what he said.

157
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,640
Cool. Shut up. I wasn't talking to you.

158
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,896
- Okay.
- You said it yourself.

159
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,600
This dude pretends to be polite,
but he came here looking for blood.

160
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,320
Who will be the first to go, huh?
Go ahead.

161
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,200
My mom spent last semester in the clink.
I was dealing with stuff here.

162
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,840
We're two for the price of one
for that son of a bitch Benjamín.

163
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
Okay, I get
that we wanna blame those around us

164
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,680
rather than accepting responsibility
for our mistakes,

165
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,600
but in this case, as you all heard,

166
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,800
this is the royal house's decision,
not my father's.

167
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,640
Don't worry, Rebeka. You're not
the only family with criminal records.

168
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,000
Take Samuel's brother.

169
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,600
What about your dad?

170
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,720
Did you forget? Though he's rich,
they know him by name at the precinct.

171
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,240
Right now, as far as the royals
and Benjamín are concerned,

172
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,680
you and I are no different, dude.

173
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,320
Same level of total bullshit.

174
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,520
PEEP INTO THE CLASSROOM.

175
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,680
GIVE ME TEN MINUTES.
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Rebe.

177
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
I really like you.

178
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,080
And... I have this sneaking suspicion
that you like me too.

179
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,200
So I don't understand why you keep
running away from me like that.

180
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,400
And what makes you think
I like you in that way? Hmm?

181
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,040
Well, I mean,
for starters, the last time I...

182
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,480
I did this to you...

183
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,960
...it also took you a while to pull away.

184
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,080
Look, I'm sorry,
but I just don't...

185
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,320
You need to get out of here.

186
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,760
The room needs to be searched
top to bottom.

187
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,040
So, tell me.
Has the world ended since I kissed you?

188
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,200
Huh? Tell me.

189
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,936
Has anything changed regarding
the way things were just five minutes ago?

190
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,440
Your dad's face. Now he's got
a reason to kick me to the curb.

191
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,040
Okay, so now you're gonna use my dad
as an excuse to avoid dealing with this?

192
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,280
Mencía, please drop it.
Let's just go about our separate ways.

193
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,160
It's really not that hard. No.
Could you just do me this favor?

194
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,200
We'd better not go near her,

195
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,120
'cause her shock waves
might blow us right into next week.

196
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,240
- They have a little something going on?
- Sure seems like it.

197
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,840
Think Rebeka went off on her
just 'cause she's a girl?

198
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,840
- No, she's not like that.
- That's not it.

199
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,320
I know what the problem is.
I mean, I can imagine.

200
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,936
Why don't you ask her
to the Lake Club for dinner tonight

201
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,160
so I can talk with her?

202
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,760
Because if <i>I </i>ask her,
she'll tell me to go fuck myself.

Oh, well,
if Benjamín says it, then it must be true.

210
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,200
And he also says that

211
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,360

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
From the ATM.

214
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,840

215
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,360

Not in what I do or what I feel.

- I don't know. You get what I mean?
- Sure.

Come on. Chill out, dude.
I mean, you guys are cool, though, right?

250
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,720
We're fine. Thanks, Omar.

251
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,400
Shit, the only way we see each other
in a bar is if you visit us at work.

252
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,520
- Things have changed this school year.
- I almost miss the old days.

253
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,920
Well, actually,
I'm still serving you guys drinks,

254
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,280
so I haven't really noticed
a difference personally, but...

255
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,160
You know what we should do?

256
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,120
Do like before and throw a real banger.

257
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,080
- All right. Please.
- Yes. So, what's the overall... vibe?

258
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,880
- High-class or low-class?
- This will be strictly for us old-timers.

259
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
We can have the party
at our house, right?

260
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,440
Although,
why are we only inviting the old-timers?

261
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,880
Who do you want to invite?

262
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
Who do you <i>not </i>want to?

263
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
- Well, Benjamín's kids, for one.
- Yeah. No, Benjamín's kids are out.

264
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,200
See? So now I'm curious
who it was <i>you </i>wanted to invite to it.

265
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,120
Ooh!

266
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,280

Great. Just what I needed.

- Not until you hear me out.

274

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,161
but how can I make things go back

277
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,360
Look at me.

278
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,960
Okay.

279
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,080

280
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,480

281
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,056
What do you think?
That with a couple hugs and kisses

282
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,176
and "I'm sorry,"
everything's gonna be the way it was?

283
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,000
I already know you're sorry.
No shit. You goddamn better be sorry.

284
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,720
Then please, just tell me what to do.

285
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,920
Don't do anything.
You did more than enough.

286
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,800
You've royally fucked me.
You lied to and humiliated me, dude.

287
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,840
What else could you do to me?

288
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,200
So after all of this, it's up to me,
and not you, whether we can be friends.

289
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Okay.

290
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,000
Is there more
to this besties heart-to-heart chat,

291
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,160
or are we done here? Okay, then.

292
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,640
I'm just askin'
that you don't shut yourself off

293
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,800
from other people.

294
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,600
Just 'cause I'm a dick and fucked you over
doesn't mean everyone else will too.

295
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Hello.

296
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,680
You're new here, honey.

297
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,960
Mm, yeah. I don't come here much.

298
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,280
He looks familiar. He a friend of yours?

299
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,440
He regularly comes here...
with girls like you.

300
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,680
What do you mean, "like <i>me</i>"?

301
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,040
Aren't you a bit young
to be doing this, sweetheart?

302
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,680
Doing what, exactly?

303
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,960
Look, lady, you've no fucking clue
what's going on between us.

304
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,960
Of course I know, dear.
I'm sure it's an awesome hourly rate.

305
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,080
At least I hope it's awesome
because young skin is worth twice as much.

306
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,200
Although, I've always felt like experience
should be worth more, but...

307
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
Get your hands off me.

308
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,640
I just hope you know what you're doing,
if you really think you're so grown up.

309
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,960
- Is the little guy still sleeping?
- Shh, I'm tryin' to concentrate.

310
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,080
Omar, could we talk for a sec?

311
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,840
- Great. Just what I needed.
- A verbal play-by-play.

312
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,920
Well, it's just that...
well, sex isn't just shoving it in.

313
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,040
- Oh, it's not?
- No.

314
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
What do you mean?

315
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,640
It's about skin.

316
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,080
And wordplay.

317
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,800
Mm... and... fantasies.

318
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,440
What are these fantasies of yours?

319
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,880
Well, the other day,
with Patrick, he... made a move.

320
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,200
I thought you said all you did was dance.

321
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,120
Well, you know. The usual horsing around.

322
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,400
Sure, the usual stuff.

323
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,200
- 'Cause that's the norm.
- Shut up and listen.

324
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,840
At one point during the night,
we were super high.

325
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,160
We were dancing,
sweating, rubbing against each other.

326
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
And he started kissing me over my clothes.

327
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,280
He said, "It's not cheating
if your clothes are on."

328
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,400
I let him for a sec.

329
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,400
Then I stopped him because of the guilt.

330
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,560
You felt guilty 'cause he made you horny?

331
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,960
- Can I be honest with you?
- I mean, yeah. We're always honest.

332
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Not horny.

333
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Horny as hell.

334
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,280
And he wouldn't stop. I kept saying,
"Stop, stop," but he kept having his way.

335
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,960
He started kissing me all over my neck

336
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,880
and then very slowly working his way down.

337
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
And when he got down to my fly,

338
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
I could feel his breath.

339
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,120
A hard-on? What does that mean?

340
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640

Phillipe?

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

358
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,480
Oh. It's just... how's your shoulder?

359
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,080
That's fine. Leave her.

360
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,360
- Recover from that accident?
- I did.

361
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,176
- Yeah?
- I'm fine. It was nothing.

362
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,240
- Oh.
- Thanks.

363
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,160
That accident.

364
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,880
I'm sorry for straight-up jumping you,
like, phew.

365
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,240
I just had to say hi to you.

366
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,000
If... If I didn't, I wouldn't have...

367
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,400
I wouldn't have slept for,
I don't know, weeks.

368
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,920
Um, Cayetana. An honor.

369
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,720
<i>Enchanté</i>. And keeping you up
at night's the last thing I want to do.

370
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,880
I was told people in Spain
give each other two kisses on the cheek.

371
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Yeah, we do.
But are you allowed to do that?

372
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,520
- Of course. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah?

373
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,280
- Phillipe?
- Nice to meet you.

374
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,320
- Welcome to Las Encinas.
- Thank you.

375
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,120
Cayetana, I'm so glad you're here.

376
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,520
Someone spilled coffee
in the computer lab, and it's gross.

377
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,880
Can you go clean it up?

378
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
Um...

379
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,200
Was the cleaning lady bothering you?

380
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,400
Uh, no. Not at all.
I was just introducing myself to everyone.

381
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,720
Employees included.

382
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
<i>Au revoir.</i>

383
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,320
Cayetana.

384
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
Trust me. I get the concept that,

385
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,240
for a cleaning lady,
one day becoming a princess

386
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,560
is as alluring as honey is to flies.

387
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,000
But remember,
honey isn't meant for the donkey's mouth.

388
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,200
Don't go after someone who isn't for you.

389
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Ciao.

390
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Ciao.

391
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,600
Did they throw her in there on purpose?

392
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Who was it?

393
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,680
They don't know a thing.

394
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,160
Or they don't want <i>us </i>to know anything.

395
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,160
Are you okay?

396
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,680
I'm gonna...
uh, splash my face with water.

397
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,680
- He turns you on. Admit it.
- Jesus. No, he doesn't.

398
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
See?

399
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,360
All right. Ander, he's attractive.
Anyone can see that.

400
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,120
I didn't get hard 'cause he turns me on.
I got hard 'cause he turned <i>you </i>on.

401
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,440
So, yes, I mean, I guess it turns me on,
imagining you being turned on by him.

402
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,840
So fine, that's true.

403
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,440
Yeah, you see how fantasies work?

404
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Yeah.

405
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,760
Let's get in the shower.

406
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,960
So, if you're turned on by Patrick,

407
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,920
and maybe it turns me on
that he turns you on...

408
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,840
What? Ask him to join us?

409
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,800
I mean, if we establish
it would still always be you and me

410
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,120
with another person.

411
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,480
Like a couples' deal. That's all.

412
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,840
- Oh, now it's your turn getting a hard-on.
- Well, of course.

413
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,840
I mean, as long as we promise each other
it stays me and you, then...

414
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,480
We'll always stay us.

415
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,240
- How the hell do we pop the question?
- I don't know. Just try asking the guy.

416
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,880
People must do it all the time.

417
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,240
Boys,
I need you to vacate this area.

418
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Come on.

419
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,760
Why, Dad? Uh, I mean, Benjamín.

420
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,920
It'll only be for 15 minutes,
so out you go, please.

421
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Come on.

422
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,600
I wonder if this guy's balls
are as blue as his blood.

423
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,496
Okay, let me get this straight.
Your father kicked us out of the showers

424
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,160
so the fucking little prince can be
by himself?

425
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
Hey. Go complain to Benjamín.

426
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,760
I'm out here half-naked,
just like the rest of you.

427
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,920
I think that was a bit over-the-top.

428
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
Look, I can't take credit for it.

429
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,120
That was all your father.

430
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
You serious?

431
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,080
Can I ask what you're doing out here?

432
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,840
We thought if His Royal Douchiness
is too good to share the showers

433
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,520
with all of our plebeian asses,
he probably won't want to share the class.

434
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,840
Maybe it's not the poor dude's fault.
Maybe it's his parents, or...

435
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,160
I... I mean,
it's probably hard being royalty.

436
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,880
So now you're taking his side
just to suck up to Ari?

437
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,080
No.
I know what it's like to be shat on

438
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,856
for having less than everyone.
We're shitting on him for having more.

439
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,280
Jesus, Samuel,
you're so quick to sell out.

440
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,080
- What do you mean? I'm not selling out...
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

441
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,600
You're really bustin' my balls, man.

442
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,040
I am? I wonder why.

443
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,640
- Don't test my patience. Okay? Bye now.
- Unbunch your panties.

444
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
Yeah?

445
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,960
Two cocky guys fighting over you.

446
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,400
They're fighting over Phillipe.

447
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,080
Um... uh, I don't know.
Am I allowed to look you in the eyes or...?

448
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,560
I'm just a cleaning lady.
I get it if His Highness doesn't want his,

449
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,960
um, cool friends to see him
with the janitor.

450
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
Hmm?

451
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,280
Oh, you don't have any.

452
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,400
But actually, I'm thinking of starting
a special little club

453
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,360
for everyone getting the silent treatment
at this school.

454
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,200
- Oh yeah? And who would be in it?
- You.

455
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,680
Me, depending on the day.

456
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,400
Well, this club doesn't sound very fun.

457
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,040
- No?
- How do I quit?

458
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,440
Hmm. It's complicated.

459
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,160
Well, to start,
you'd have to win over the club's founder.

460
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
That would be me.

461
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,360
And second, you'd need to tone down

462
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,000
that royal cockiness
just a couple of notches.

463
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
I accept.

464
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,640
As long as you tone down
the groupie behavior

465
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,000
a couple notches as well.

466
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Ouch.

467
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,320
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,360
The founder's kind of been
a lifelong fan of yours

469
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,520
and knows too much, honestly.

470
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
And now it feels
like she knows you personally.

471
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Look, if you want, we can start over.

472
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,360
Yes, that's better. Let's do it.

473
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,240
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

474
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,080
- I'm Phillipe.
- Cayetana.

475
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,400
Although, um, I was told people in Spain
give each other two kisses on the cheek.

476
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,520
Yeah.

477
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,880
<i>Enchanté.</i>

478
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,456
I mean, half the planet would kill
to have Phillipe von Triesenberg

479
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,320
at their party.

480
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,920
What happened to old-timers only?

481
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,480
Guys, the only thing Phillipe wants

482
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,120
is the same as any normal person,
rich or poor.

483
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,480
He just wants to fit in.

484
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,040
Can he come or not?

485
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,000
- Sure, invite him. Why not?
- Yeah?

486
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,560
Awesome.

487
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,600
Ari!

488
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
You comin' tonight?

489
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,120
- Where?
- There's a party at my place.

490
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Okay.

491
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,640
Hmm. You won't like it.

492
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,520
- It's not on-brand for you.
- Guzmán.

493
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,640
I've been to humble homes before.

494
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,480
Yeah, but it's not the house.
It's the theme.

495
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,600
What theme?

496
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,400
To celebrate that us OGs
don't mind sharing everything,

497
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
including the showers,
unlike the little prince,

498
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,120
we're gonna have a party, and it's, uh,

499
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,880
a good old towel party.

500
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,520
- What do you mean?
- No, shut up. That's cool.

501
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,000
Each person
is only allowed to bring one towel.

502
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,280
And to be honest, I don't see the prince
or you being into it.

503
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,560
What? No way. Phillipe doesn't mind
getting undressed in front of whoever.

504
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,680
The thing
with the showers was imposed on him.

505
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,640
Well, I'm bringing my best towel.

506
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,336
Unless you don't want me there,
'cause I get the feeling you don't.

507
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,400
Me? No, it's good.
Since you're officially invited now.

508
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,760
So, there's no possible reason
you wouldn't want me there, right?

509
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,120
- None at all.
- Great.

510
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,496
- Thanks, Samuel.
- Don't mention it.

511
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,960
- See you there.
- That's right.

512
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,800
Mencía.

513
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,240
We'd love for you to come to a party
at my house tonight. Are you up for it?

514
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,080
Uh, yeah, sure. Thank you.

515
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
You got it.

516
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,320
It's on me. What do you want?

517
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,000
- Let's do shots.
- Right now?

518
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,200
Of course. To warm things up.

519
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,320
Go big or go home.
You go this full-out on everything, or...?

520
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,240
After spending two years in bed,
unable to move,

521
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,400
I'm not really someone who sits around
waiting for things to just happen.

522
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,240
I see what I want, go for it, and get it.

523
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,920
Cheers to us.

524
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
- Ugh, that's nasty.
- Ugh.

525
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,520
All right, I'm going to the john.
You've got a better way with words.

526
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,840
So, what were you saying earlier?

527
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,640
You go after what you want,
and you always get it?

528
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,560
I want it all.

529
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,320
Like, all the time.

530
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,040
You mean you want <i>everyone </i>all the time?

531
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,680
A slight difference there.

532
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,920
Listen, don't get it twisted here.

533
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,760
The libertine lifestyle
and partying doesn't make me happy.

534
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,600
What I actually want
is something really... worthwhile, you know?

535
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,520
But that feels practically impossible.

536
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,880
Why's that?

537
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,240
Okay, well, assuming your soulmate
hasn't already died or not been born yet,

538
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,280
the possibilities of finding them
are one in 10,000 lifetimes.

539
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,120
Honestly,
I don't buy the whole soulmates thing.

540
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,240
It means just a marketing gimmick to me.
But sure, all right. I'll humor you.

541
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,960
So, what do you call you and Ander, then?

542
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,200
Pfft.

543
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,160
I mean, call it whatever you want.

544
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,760
But, uh...

545
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,520
...you know when you fuck somebody
and look 'em in the eyes,

546
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,520
and in that moment,
time stands still?

547
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,320
And for five seconds,
you get this feeling.

548
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,680
There's nothing else but them.

549
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,360
And you can't help yourself but to smile.

550
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,640
Of course you know it.

551
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,760
Because you got to have that
with each other in this lifetime.

552
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,880
Hey. Welcome.

553
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,360
- Hi.
- Come in.

554
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,840
Check it out. That there's the bathroom.
And my room, in case you want to change.

555
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,080
- You want a drink?
- What?

556
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,360
- Do you want a drink?
- I don't drink alcohol.

557
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,560
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

558
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,040
Ari. Come on. Get your towel and drink up.

559
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,520
- Patrick, I don't drink. You know that.
- Yeah, except for when you do.

560
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,560
Come on. I want Ira to come to the party.
She's awesome.

561
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,480
Who is Ira?

562
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,520
She's like your cool alter ego
when you're drunk. Your dark side.

563
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,680
Ari, Ira.

564
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,560
That's the dream team.

565
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
Hey there.

566
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,720
Here, come on. Let's summon Ira.

567
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,121
Okay, I'll have a little,
but just 'cause my mouth is dry.

568
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,560
Sure, whatever.

569
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,440
Unfortunately, there's no garbagemen
here for your amusement this time.

570
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,520
Garbagemen who?

571
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,360
About seven in the morning?
It was August, in Biarritz.

572
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,560
Want me to show you the video?

573
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,920
- No.
- I figured.

575
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
I came up with the towel party idea.

576
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,760
- Hi.
- And I said, "Why not?"

577
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,560
Hello. How you doing?

578
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,240
I'm great. How are you tonight?

579
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,440
I'm great.

580
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,760
I have an idea. Wanna dance?

581
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,280
Or chitchat a bit?

582
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,680
Or chitchat while dancing?

583
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,880
Excuse me.

584
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,520
- Is Nadia your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

585
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,880
- Oh.
- Hey. How are you, sweetie?

586
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,080
Mm, are you naked right now?

587
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,320
No, I'm wearing a towel.

588
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,680

589
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,920

Oh, she's one of the new kids here.
They just joined our class.

596
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,120
Guzmán, I can barely hear you.
Can you please find a quieter spot?

597
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,400

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,360

- Not at all. You look fuckin' awesome.

602
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,760
It's just that,
once it gets to be this late,

603
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
between the hot outfits
and the buzz, well...

604
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,160
- What do you expect?
- What?

605
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,080
Well, so...

609
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,000

610
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,960
- No.

Yes.

614
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Well, why didn't you just come out
and say that?

615
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,440
'Cause of what you said earlier.
That now you're looking to settle down.

616
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,400
The thing about the five seconds

617
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,240
versus going around,
having meaningless sex.

618
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,280
This late and dressed in a towel?
Now is not when you settle down.

619
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,120

690
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,520
I thought you didn't drink.

691
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,520
Funny, and I thought
you didn't undress in public

692
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,760
'cause your nipples
are too fancy and royal.

693
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,880
- Oh.
- Oh, fuck.

694
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,720
Who's that hunk over there?

695
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,640
He's in our class, I think.

696
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,040
- Really?
- Pretty sure this is his party.

697
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,840
Oh yeah, he opened the door for me.

698
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,200
- Hi.
- Hi there. How are you?

699
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,200
- Great, how are you?
- I'm great now.

700
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,520
Oh, I'm so glad.

701
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,040
I didn't think you'd come.

702
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,680
- Why not?
- Because we're not part of the same class.

703
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,000
What do you mean?

704
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,280
Phillipe just told me we were.
You are messing with me.

705
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,240
No.
We're not part of the same social class.

706
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,240
Not like our school.

707
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, all right. I get you.

708
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,280
Well, when I drink,
I forget all about stupid old class.

709
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,480
- Really?
- Yeah. In every sense of the word.

710
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,960
- Yeah.
- Because "class" is super polysemic.

711
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,880
And polysyllabic.

712
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,120
So, when I drink, I forget every last bit.

713
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,800
- Mm.
- That's why I don't drink.

714
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,600
I get the feeling
she prefers waiters to princes.

715
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,720
- Tough break.
- It's possible.

716
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,936
- I know.
- Mm-hmm.

717
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,840
- Wanna dance with me?
- Sure.

718
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,160
Come on, then.

719
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,960
I really admire what you do.

720
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,640
But why? What have I done in my life
to make you admire me?

721
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,040
Shit, where do I start?

722
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,480
You can wear whatever you want,
but you gamble on young designers

723
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,720
who normally get zero exposure,
and you give them just that.

724
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, that's it.
Who was your seed designer?

725
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,920
Huh?

726
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,800
Those of us who like fashion

727
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,320
all have that one special designer
who planted that first seed.

728
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,160
For example, mine is Silvio Alessandro...

729
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,680
...de la Guardia.
Sadelagu.

730
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,280
- You're kidding me. He's yours as well?
- Of course.

731
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,680
What's the matter?

732
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,840
You're used to smiling and all the girls
falling at your feet, aren't you?

733
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,400
Well, just maybe,
that tactic won't work with me.

734
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,320
Sure.
Let me see if I get this right, okay?

735
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,800
What you want is to play it cool
and reject me

736
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,840
so that eventually,
I'll end up falling in love with you.

737
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,160
- Oh.
- I can tell you how that tactic ends.

738
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,400
Badly, right?

739
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Best scenario, you are in the friend zone.

740
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,600
Oof. Friend zone?

741
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,960
- Mm-hmm.
- Fatal.

742
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,800
- Isn't it?
- We don't like the friend zone at all.

743
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,480
- We don't like it?
- No.

744
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,880
- Here's the problem.
- What?

745
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,040
I wanna kiss you, but I won't
take advantage of a drunk girl.

746
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,440
- Are you drunk right now?
- No.

747
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,480
- You're not?
- No.

748
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,640
- Then I'll kiss you.
- Okay.

749
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,240
Nadia.

750
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Hi.

751
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,800
<i>Hey, listen.</i>

752
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,680
<i>I've been thinking.</i>

753
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
<i>And you're right.</i>

754
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,480
<i>We're in over our heads,
and we can't get them above water.</i>

755
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,280
It doesn't make any sense to keep trying.

756
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,720
<i>Let's give each other
a couple days to think it over, okay?</i>

757
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,520
<i>Okay. That would be good. Get some rest.</i>

758
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,320
Oh no, the garbagemen.

759
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,640
Now the alcohol's out of your system,
you've remembered class again.

760
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,000
What? What class? You mean at school?

761
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,160
Uh, no, I don't... I don't drink.

762
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,520
I don't know what alcohol
you're talking about.

763
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,440
Don't worry.
I'm good at staying in the background.

764
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,680
It's where I live.

765
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,640
I don't want anyone
to get expelled because of me.

766
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,480
No one should pay for their family's sins
because of who my family is.

767
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,840
It's a matter of control and security.

768
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,480
My family didn't ask for even half
of the measures you put in place.

769
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,080
<i>Besides, I've had the chance
to meet my classmates,</i>

770
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,000
<i>and I feel welcome.</i>

771
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,280
<i>I don't see any danger in them.</i>

772
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,560
Very well.

773
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,440
Which measures should I get rid of?

774
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,560
<i>The cameras, perhaps?</i>

775
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,560
<i>No, not the cameras.</i>

776
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,880
I'd prefer it if you kept them.
