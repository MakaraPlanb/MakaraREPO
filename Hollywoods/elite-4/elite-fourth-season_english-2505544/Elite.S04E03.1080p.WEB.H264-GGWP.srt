00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,176
<i>When you've been through cancer,
you associate fucking everything with it.</i>

2
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>At first, you deny it,
but then you can't stop bringing it up</i>

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,760
<i>all the time,</i>

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,800
<i>always kinda shoehorning it in there.</i>

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,400
<i>But when it comes to those four,
cancer's a pretty decent analogy.</i>

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,080
What four are you referring to?

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,440
Um, Benjamín and company.

8
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,280
Benjamín, Patrick, Mencía.

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
And Ari.

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,920
What happened when they got here?

11
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,120
They destroyed what they touched,
like a metastatic growth.

12
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
<i>♪ Buh-bye ♪</i>

13
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,000
<i>Uh, yeah. It's me.
Do you still want us to be besties again?</i>

14
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,120
<i>'Cause, well, look, I woke up obsessed,
so you win, partner.</i>

15
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>With Mencía?
Yeah, you guys were all over each other.</i>

16
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
We had the best time ever.
She's just so fuckin' incredible, man.

17
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,200
And now I'm doin' that thing I do,

18
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,240
where I start projecting, pining,
and getting completely addicted.

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,200
<i>I'm tellin' ya, it's bad.
I can barely sleep.</i>

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,320
<i>But whenever I do sleep, I dream of her.</i>

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,400
<i>And she hasn't texted since the party.
I've been stalking her Instagram.</i>

22
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,360
<i>She's still posting, so she's not dead.
You know what I mean?</i>

23
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,760
What in the fuck is this bullshit?

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,920
Hey, Rebeka.

25
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,720
Yeah, it's nuts.
They're all over the school.

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,200
<i>So, like one of her posts
or text her yourself.</i>

27
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
Advice from a crazy dude.

28
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,200
<i>Good morning, students.</i>

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,920
<i>I'm greeting you virtually
this fine morning</i>

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,840
<i>to bring you some exciting news.</i>

31
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,120
<i>An idea proposed
by one of your classmates.</i>

32
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,216
<i>To thank you for the warm welcome
you've given me at the school,</i>

34
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,680
<i>I wanted to offer
a, uh, a kind gesture to you.</i>

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,920
<i>Well, I suppose that,
uh, the majority of you</i>

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
<i>know about Paris's </i>le Bal, <i>no?</i>

37
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,920
<i>Well, I want to organize it,
and I'm throwing it here with all of you.</i>

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,600
<i>It's something
that I'm really looking forward to,</i>

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
<i>and I know
I certainly wouldn't want to miss it.</i>

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,400
<i>I hope you won't either.</i>

41
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,240
Yeah, but, come on, Samuel.
How can I tell her what I feel for her

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,720
when what I feel
is that I am fucking crazy, ya know?

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,480
I don't wanna overwhelm her,
and this is overwhelming shit, man.

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,640
Uh, well, listen to it.

45
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,840
- I'm not gonna repeat it.
- To what? You didn't send anything.

46
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,960
What do you mean, I didn't send anything?

47
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,280
- No, no, no!
- Wait, did you just send...?

48
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,240
- What did you say about her?
- All good things.

49
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,720
- But, like, too good.
- So what's the problem here?

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,680
She's online.
She'll see it. She's online, dude.

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Uh...

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,520
Single. Seriously?

53
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,760
Well, that was fast.

54
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,120
I guess I thought
maybe we would work it out.

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,040
Didn't <i>you </i>break it off with her?

56
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,760
Yeah, but she agreed to it.

57
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,960
Nadia knows what she wants.

58
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Do you?

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,920
I mean, what got into you after the party
that made you break up with her?

60
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,000
Distance. It's a major bitch, you know.

61
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,440
Would "distance"
happen to be a cute swimmer?

62
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,800
What is your problem, dude?

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,200
You saw us hooking up,
it annoyed you, and you broke up with her.

64
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,480
Okay. Your crazy's showing.
I need you to tone it down.

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,080
It really annoys you that much
Ari wasn't my fucking Pluto?

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,520
- Like, really?
- That's why you did it? To piss me off?

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,160
The world doesn't revolve around you.
We felt like it.

68
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,680
- Yeah, sure.
- It's not like you're a couple.

69
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,560
If you hadn't gotten in the way,
who's to say?

70
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,800
- See? It <i>was </i>about Ari.
- Let's get one thing straight.

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,040
If you keep this up,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
I need you to take a breather.

73
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,040
Whether you have something with her
is between you and her.

74
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,360
Leave me out of it.

75
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
<i>Okay,
so, </i>le Bal <i>is a charity ball,</i>

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,656
organized as a way to present
debutantes from the best families

77
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
to society, okay?

78
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,920
Ah, right, it wouldn't be complete
without its fancy chandeliers,

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,240
its guillotine, and,
oh, the Black Death's so hot right now.

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Cayetana, that's some retrograde,
sexist-ass bullshit.

81
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Actually, it's not sexist,
'cause, for <i>le Bal</i>, we girls

82
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,560
are the ones who are gonna be choosing
our cavaliers, or dates.

83
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,840
- Hmm.
- In other words, you mean <i>us </i>girls, right?

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
Ah. Ari, how should I explain this?
You're invisible to me.

85
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,680
- Worse, you're beige. Ciao.
- Buh-bye.

86
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,200
What was that look you just gave me?

87
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,120
About the classist way
you just came for Cayetana.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,800
Look,
I was just trying to be objective, Samuel.

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,240
She's the cleaning lady.

90
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,720
And I'm the waiter on scholarship.
That's why you won't invite me, isn't it?

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,480
I mean, I can't go anyway.
They hired the Lake Club to do catering.

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,440
Well, I'm sorry you can't come as a guest.

93
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,840
It's not really my thing.

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,520
Festivals of fakes and poseurs.

95
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
When are we meeting up again?

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,280
- I can meet today.
- No, not today.

97
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,400
Why? You can't meet up after work?

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Yeah, but I'd rather chill on the sofa.

99
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,760
Really?

100
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,320
Ander, I'm the one who's working.
I'm kinda tired, okay?

101
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,040
NADIA, I'D LIKE TO CHAT TONIGHT.
CAN YOU?

102
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,360
- Can I talk with you just a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

103
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,040
Okay, so, basically,

104
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,800
I'd love to have a cavalier
walk arm in arm with me at <i>le Bal</i>,

105
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,400
and I heard you're available.

106
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,400
How would you know?

107
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
Facebook.
It told me and the entire school.

108
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,640
- Right.
- Wanna go with me?

109
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,480
Well, I'd love to go to the ball,
but I'm not that into sloppy seconds.

110
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,480
Sorry, what?

111
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,320
You asked Samuel to go,
and he said no, right?

112
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,960
Uh, no.

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,520
He didn't say no,
because I never asked him to be my date.

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm surprised. It seemed like you had
a good time at the towel party.

115
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,200
- Who told you that?
- Facebook, do ya think?

116
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,680
Nothing happened at the towel party.

117
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
And, anyway,
I'm not asking him, 'cause he's...

118
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,880
- '- Cause he's a waiter. Just say it.
- He's a waiter.

119
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,320
Because he's not my type.

120
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,760
Right. Let's say if Samuel

121
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,640
was a count instead of just a waiter,
would you be interested?

122
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,080
Okay. If you were a redhead
and half as tall,

123
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,520
maybe you wouldn't be you,
and I wouldn't ask you either.

124
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,896
- Yeah.
- Are you hearing yourself?

125
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,480
Yeah, I hear it.
And I don't feel like going anymore.

126
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,080
Can you please get outta my car?

127
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,480
SURE, CALL ME

128
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,800
Balenciaga was born in 1895 in Getaria.

129
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,480
Jávea, um...

130
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,400
You scared me!

131
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,600
Are you <i>the </i>Miss Grajera Pando?

132
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,200
- That would be me.
- How are you?

133
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm fine. And you?

134
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,800
Good. I came by to ask you something.
What are your plans for this Friday night?

135
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,000
Um...

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,720
Nothing. Just studying.

137
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,720
I may not look like it,
but I'm getting a degree.

138
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,320
I see. I'd like, um,
for you to accompany me to the ball.

139
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
Well, really,
I want you to ask me so I can say yes.

140
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,440
But I wasn't invited.

141
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
You are now.

142
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,680
- Why me, though?
- Why not?

143
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,640
There's no way
they'll let me be your date.

144
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,600
I choose where it happens
and who gets invited.

145
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
The others just donate
and pose for the photos,

146
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
which is all they want.

147
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,520
In other words, you wanted a second date,
and you didn't know how to ask for it.

148
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Come on, now.
Don't jump to conclusions, all right?

149
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,520
Yeah? And what conclusions could those be?

150
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,376
- What conclusions?
- Did I stutter?

151
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,600
"If he asks me on a second date,
it's because he likes me a lot."

152
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,240
"And, if things go well, who knows?
There could even be a third."

153
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,120
Third, huh? Oh my my my, no.
You need to slow way down.

154
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,240
- I do?
- Uh, yeah.

155
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,880
But you are the one thinking all that.

156
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, do you like what I think
in your scenario?

157
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Fuck.

158
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,120
Yeah, I'm coming! Chill out!

159
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,640
- Room service.
- What are you doing here?

160
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,280
If Muhammad won't go to the mountain...

161
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Yeah, it's just that,
uh, Muhammad isn't feeling well.

162
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,400
Well, this cures everything.
Come on. Let's go.

163
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,200
Jesus Christ.

164
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,600
Mm-hmm.
Shot glasses, where are you hiding?

165
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,640
Aha! I'm kind of a genius.

166
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,440
Uh, it's just that I can't today, Mencía.

167
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,920
It's not a good time for me,
and I'm so busy.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Come on. Just take a seat.

169
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,040
We need to talk about
your little voice message from earlier.

170
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,920
Please don't do this to me.

171
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,200
Would you sit down?

172
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
I really can't see a thing.

173
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,280
- Ah! Straight?
- Step by step, step by step...

174
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,200
- Straight ahead of you.
- Okay. Like, forward?

175
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,456
I got you.

176
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,560
- Just a little further, a little further.
- Uh-huh.

177
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,840
A little...

178
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,320
- What is all this?
- Pick whichever ones you want.

179
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,480
Oh my God! But, Phillipe!

180
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
All right.

181
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,840
Okay. For every question you ask me,
I'll ask you another.

182
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,240
Oh, I thought you'd say to remove
a piece of clothing or something.

183
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,200
Well, that's when your answer is wrong
or you don't answer the question.

184
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
'Kay.

185
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,720
Uh...

186
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,880
- Describe yourself in three words.
- Hmm.

187
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,400
- Fearless.
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,120
And passionate.

189
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,480
And... messed up.

190
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,280
That was four words.

191
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,840
Yeah, but "messed up"
is a singular concept.

192
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
But, all right.

193
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,880

Being lied to, being taken for an idiot,

and being told something,
then finding out the truth.

199
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,920

My blood pressure's kinda low.

266
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,640
Why don't you bring us
beers and some olives

267
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,120
so we can get to know each other?

268
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,680
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'll go get some. I'm going.

269
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,960
How much did you charge my daughter?

270
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,000
Nothing.

271
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,040
Oh, of course.
First round's on the house, right?

272
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,256
You tell her you're a prostitute yet?

273
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,760
I'm not a prostitute.

274
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,640
You sleep with men,
and they give you money.

275
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,200
Ask Google and see what it says there.

276
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,400
What I do with my life
isn't your business, so butt out.

277
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,440
It is if it affects my daughter.

278
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
So, you have three options.

279
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
You tell her,

280
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,080
I tell her, or you leave the picture.

281
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,080
You decide which.

282
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,280
Here are the beers.
They're nice and cold.

283
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,800

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,120

Cheers.

286
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,560
I just don't feel like having a threesome
with Patrick or anyone else.

287
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
Like, been there, done that.
You know what I mean?

288
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,000
But it's just sex.

289
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,280
Do you trust us or not?

290
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,720
I'd rather not test us, honestly.

291
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,320
What?

292
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,280
NEW MESSAGE FROM PATRICK

293
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,200
- What?
- What about what?

294
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,200
It just looked like
you were gonna say something.

295
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,720
I'M IN THE PRIVATE ROOM. JOIN ME.

296
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800

298
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,680

299
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,840
No, never mind.

300
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,080
No, tell me.

301
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
It's okay.

302
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,920
Look, Omar, you're the one
who wanted to open this door.

303
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,680
And now you wanna close it?

304
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,880
It's not fair.

305
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
Maybe I <i>don't </i>wanna close it.

306
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,560
I'm sleeping at my place tonight.

307

309
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,120

310
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,560
Maybe we pushed it too soon.

311
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,760
Or, I guess, I did.

316
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,640

317
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,080
'Cause you're so sure about what you want.

318
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,800

322
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
<i>I don't know.

323

<i>that we both look ahead.</i>

324
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
Yeah. You're right.

325
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,480
And, yes, it <i>is </i>scary.

326
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
<i>I changed my status to single.</i>

327
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,760
<i>'Cause... I don't know, maybe it's stupid,</i>

328
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,400
<i>but the fact that it's out there
for the whole world</i>

329
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,760
<i>makes it real to me.</i>

330
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,600
<i>So I think
you should try to look ahead, too, Guzmán.</i>

331
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,680

332
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,440

<i>Wherever the sun sets, I'll be there.</i>

339
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,240
All right.

340
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,440
I'll try moving forward.

341
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,280
<i>We can only try.</i>

342
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Okay.

343
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Adios, Nadia.

344
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,000
You all right?

345
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,280
No, yeah. Everything's fine.

346
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,640
Okay.

347
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,200
Mencía, what's the matter?

348
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,800
Sorry. I just can't do it.

349
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,160
- I don't know...
- Yeah, I... I got it.

350
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,640
Sorry. No, no, I get it.
I'm overwhelming you.

351
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,840
No, no, that's not it. It's just, uh,

352
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,040
I don't know,
your mother's right outside the room,

353
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,440
and she caught us, and...

354
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,800
My mother?

355
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,960
But who cares? She's cool with it.
Did she say something?

356
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
- No, it's not that.
- Okay.

357
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,640
She was really nice,
but, uh, I don't know.

358
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
It's just that
I can't do this sort of thing

359
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,200
at my house with Benjamín, and,

360
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,320
well, let's just leave it
for some other day, okay?

361
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,120
S <i>omeone is at the front door.</i>

362
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Um...

363
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
No.

364
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,600
- Forget it. Nah.
<i>- What?</i>

365
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,480
<i>Oh, hi. How are you?</i>

366
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Hi.

367
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,080
Why are you here?

368
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,960
- Can I come in?
- No.

369
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,320
My father's inside. It's better out here.

370
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,520
I see. Um... I'm really sorry.

371
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,160
I acted like a caveman
and an arrogant prick.

372
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,760
- Wow.
- Heh.

373
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,840
Now, that's the way
to start a proper speech.

374
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,840
Well, I also came to say that...

375
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,480
that I'd love to go to the ball with you.

376
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Oh?

377
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,480
And... wait for you
at the bottom of the stairs

378
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,040
with my arm like this...

379
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,960
...so I was waiting to see
if you'd invite me.

380
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,800
That is, if you still want me to come.

381
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,960
Is that a yes?

382
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,320
I'm getting to know you better, right?

383
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
Yes.

384
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,160
That's a yes.

385
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,120
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,320
I mean, perfect. So let's talk and, uh...

387
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,960
- And we'll see each other.
- Okay.

388
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,600
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

389
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,480
Did Guzmán talk to you about Ari?

390
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,960
He left my sister for her.

391
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,400
How about Ander then?

392
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,080
No idea.

393
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,200
Did he talk to Samuel?

394
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Samuel.

395
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,440
Hey.

396
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,880
- Yo. What's going on?
- Nothin'. I'm good.

397
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,120
Hey, you were right
about things with Ari and me.

398
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,240
- It was just up to us.
- Oh, yeah?

399
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,040
We met up last night,
and we're goin' to the ball together.

400
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,120
Oh shit. That's awesome.

401
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,080
- Yeah. You're not angry, are you?
- Me?

402
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,640
No way, dude.

403
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,640
Not at all.

404
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,120
Cool. You just had a one-night stand.
I mean, you're not actually into her.

405
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,880
Are you tryin' to tell me something?

406
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,320
No, I just think
she and I are legit into each other,

407
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,840
and I wanted to check
you weren't hopin' for more.

408
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,960
That we're cool.

409
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Yeah? I don't know
why you're making me a part of your shit.

410
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,960
Hey! Whoa. I didn't mean to piss you off.

411
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,560
It seems like you don't really like her.
You're being an asshat.

412
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,401
See? I knew you'd get pissed,
though you went after her to annoy me...

413
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,280
Guzmán, get off my dick!
Seems like I'm the one you're into.

414
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,880
You can keep Ari,
keep the motorcycle, keep it all.

415
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
Guy can't decide what he wants.

416
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,600
- Good morning.
- Hey.

417
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,200
Listen, I've been thinking about this.

418
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,200
Like, I know you'll think
this is some vulgar, medieval shit.

419
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,400
And for the record, so do I.

420
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,280
But, I don't know,
maybe there might be something to it.

421
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
Since one of us
is supposed to ask, I thought,

422
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,880
"C'mon, Rebeka, just nut up and do it."
So, uh, wanna be my cavalier?

423
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm sorry.

424
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,040
I can't, hon. It's just that I have to...

425
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,760
What? What is it?

426
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,480
It's nothing exciting.
Just some things I have to take care of.

427
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,856
You know I don't like being dependent
on Benjamín for shit.

428
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
Oh.

429
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm sorry.

430
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Not here.

431
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Why?

432
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,720
You have to tell me about the protocols
you established with your boyfriend.

433
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,240
<i>It was just sex.</i>

434
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,640
What happened?

435
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,080
- Why do you wanna know?
- Because I just wanna know.

436
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,000
Tell me.

437
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,760
<i>He texted when I got in the taxi.</i>

438
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,640
<i>You arranged to meet
while at my place?</i>

439
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,800
- <i>No.
- Yes.</i>

440
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,960
<i>I made up my mind in the taxi.</i>

441
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Hey, handsome.

442
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,680
How'd it go down?

443
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,960
We tell each other everything,

444
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,120
and I have to catch you
on this stupid bullshit? Seriously?

445
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,920
This is the Patrick method
for drinking tequila.

446
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,800
The first step...

447
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,440
is licking the salt.

448
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,280
<i>Then he licked my neck.</i>

449
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,920
He poured salt on it.

450
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,920
Then he dipped my fingers in lemon.

451
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
And the final move...

452
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,840
We started getting hot and bothered
right at the bar, and...

453
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,760
Uh, and so on.

454
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,600
And so on?

455
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,440
So we fucked, dude.

456
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,680
You're saying that you went for it?

457
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,400
- Why's it matter?
- I said, tell me about it.

458
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,240
<i>He went to the bathroom,
and I followed him.</i>

459
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,280
We closed the door after us
and started making out.

460
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Then I unbuttoned his shirt.
I started kissing him.

461
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,240
Yes. Hey.

462
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Under the clothes is cheating, remember?

463
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,040
Then I got to his dick and sucked it.

464
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,800
Then he grabbed me
and fucked me against the wall.

465
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,240
Until we both got off.

466
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,240
I don't get it.

467
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,400
You pissed off or turned on?

468
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,480
Omar, it was just sex. That's all.

469
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,080
You used condoms, or did you not bother?

470
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,680
Of course. What do you think this is?

471
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,600
I don't know anymore, to be honest.

472
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Can this not happen again? Hmm?

473
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Yeah.

474
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,080
All right.

475
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,040
Do you want some?

476
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,520
It's the best in Madrid.

477
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,440
From the owner of that Speakeasy
we went to the other day.

478
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,360
Wait, the <i>owner </i>sold you that coke?

479
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,160

480
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,240
Um, I gotta head out.

481
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,840
All right. So, where are you heading?

482
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,480
I need cash.

483
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,920

- Don't be.

Cayetana, I did it as a precaution. Okay?

593
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,880
What did you think of me?
That I'm some spy or terrorist?

- Listen to me! Hold on!
- What!

600
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,520
Look,
I met... I met this girl, okay?

601
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,800
I thought she was charming, like you.
And I liked her the way I do you.

602
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,480
But she was just into me being a royal.

603
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,360
Because I guess a prince
is a perfect target

604
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,080
if you want to falsely accuse someone
of being sexually abusive

605
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,760
and make yourself a fortune
blackmailing him.

606
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,040
I'm sorry about that,
but you had no right to film me.

607
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,400
I mean, <i>that's </i>abusive.
For you to do that, without asking me.

608
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,080
Cayetana, sometimes security demands
we have to bend the rules a bit.

609
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,680
Okay, so you record me

610
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,320
then insult my integrity,
calling me a greedy scammer?

611
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,280
What?
But I never called you anything like that.

612
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Oh my God, you did!

613
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,040
I was being cautious.
You know what I've heard? Huh?

614
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,360
- No.
- They say you are a con artist.

615
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,240
A liar. Listen to me!

616
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,920
Ex-girlfriend of a murderer.
Maybe an accomplice.

617
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,016
I don't know whether to give credit
for finding this information

618
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,320
to my intelligence services
or the bathroom stalls of Las Encinas.

619
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,480
Hey, listen to me.

620
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,120
- Don't do that.
- Listen to me, please, Cayetana.

621
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
- Cayetana!
- What? What, what, what?

622
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,680
Look, you're so intelligent and fun.

623
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,320
You know exactly what you want.

624
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,160
And I really like you.

625
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,560
And that's why,
despite everything I've heard out there,

626
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,640
I still want to get to know you
and hear your side of this.

627
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,000
And now you can choose
whether you still want to know me.

628
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,600
When I save up
the amount of money I'm hoping to,

629
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,720
you and I can move in together.

630
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,560
- That right?
- Yeah.

631
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,920
- All right. Where?
- Wherever you want.

632
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,920
Hmm.

633
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,880

634
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,560
So, the thing right now is, finally,

635
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,160

I'm pretty happy with my old lady.

636

Ah, well.

637
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,960
And what would you think
if I set up a place first?

638
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,960
And started makin' room for you?

639
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,601
Well, I think it sounds like I'm gonna
need to get at least two drinks

640
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,360
in order to properly mull it over.

641
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,160
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

642
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,160

649
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,480
No one. It was nothing.

655
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,240
- I'm heading back home.
- How come?

656
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,520
I'm just kinda exhausted.

657
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,480
You stayin' late?

658
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,960
Yeah, until the party's over
and I put everything away.

659
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,760
See ya later.

660
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,960
- You check your boyfriend's cell phone?
- Leave Ander alone.

661
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,120
Leave us both alone.

662
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,040
Look, I can step aside.

663
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,160
But he might come for me.

664
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,040
I don't know. You just wrote to him,
and he didn't come, did he?

665
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,840
But you did.

666
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,080
Do Ander and I make you jealous,
or do you want a piece of it?

667
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,960
I can only think of one way
to improve this position.

668
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,320
What's up, man?

669
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,920

670
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,600

671
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,680
- What are you?
- I was serving her a drink.

672
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,480
So, you're getting my girl drunk
so she'll hook up with you again?

673
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,800
- I'm sorry, what?
- Listen, man. I'm not interested.

674
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,160
Sure, laugh.
You're such a pain in my ass.

675
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,400
- What?
- Come here a minute.

676
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,576
- Don't grab me like that.
- I said come here.

677
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,600
Okay.

678
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,840
Okay, I'm not sure
what I liked least about the phrase

679
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,176
"You're getting my girl drunk
so she'll hook up with you."

680
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,600
- It... I meant to say, "My date."
- "Your" girl?

681
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,160
Okay. So to you, I'm just a puppet
with no will of its own

682
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,521
that you take turns manipulating into
hooking up with you?

683
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,400
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean puppet.

684
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,280
- You think I'm your property.
- That's not what I meant, Ari. Okay?

685
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,040
You came here with me.
I came here with you. What is the problem?

686
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,560
We're off to a bad start
if you don't think there's a problem.

687
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,840
- Do you wanna be with me, or don't you?
- That depends.

688
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,120
You know what? For me, it depends on
whether you'll act like a Neanderthal,

689
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,400
turn around and apologize,

690
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,840
but then whip your club out again,
so on and so forth.

691
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,720
- Understand?
- Mm-hmm.

692
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,200
- You're right.
- Don't say I'm right to shut me up.

693
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,240
Come on.
I'm not telling you to shut you up.

694
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,560
I'm asking you to forgive me.

695
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
I'm gonna learn.

696
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,120
Step by step.

697
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,560
Step by step.

698
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,880
It also depends on if you kiss me.

699
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,120
No, I mean,
you're talking about a relationship,

700
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,040
and you haven't even kissed me yet.

701
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,840
Yeah.

702
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,320
- Should I?
- No, I'll go for it. I got nervous.

703
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,400
Okay.

713
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,960
You look nervous.

714
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,280
Are you worried
she might wake up and talk?

715
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,720
No. No.

716
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,440
I'm worried she might not.

717
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,920
What if she doesn't wake up?

718
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,600
Then I guess
we wouldn't be looking for an assailant.

719
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,320
We'd be looking for a murderer.
