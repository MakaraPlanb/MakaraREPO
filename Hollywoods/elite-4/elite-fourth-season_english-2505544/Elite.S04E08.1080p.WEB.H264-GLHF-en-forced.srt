1
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,440
THE MESS YOU LEAVE BEHIND

2
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,120
BEFORE I GO: OMAR

3
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
BEFORE I GO: OMAR

4
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,800
Benjamín, would you give us a moment?

5
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,440
DECEMBER 31

6
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
What do you intend to do?

7
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,280
I organized this to celebrate
the New Year with my guests.

8
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,880
And Cayetana is my guest in her own right.

9
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,960
As a friend and as a designer.

10
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,040
You are a fool

11
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,880
and an ingrate.

12
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,280
And whose fault is it?

13
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,600
Who raised me this way?

14
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Phillipe...

15
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
I brought you into this world.

16
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,400
I raised you.

17
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,560
I never took my eyes off you,

18
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,480
except when it was better
to look the other way.

19
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,240
Something that happened quite often.

20
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,920
My role has been to love and protect you,
and I have done that impeccably.

21
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,160
If now, all of a sudden,

22
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,600
you want to be an adult
and walk on alone, do it.

23
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,200
Accept the consequences of your choices.

24
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
That's all.

25
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,240
WHERE ARE YOU?

26
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
I WANT TO START THE NEW YEAR WITH YOU.

27
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,040
I HAVE PLANS. I'M SORRY.

28
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,880
I KNOW. I'M HERE, IN YOUR PLANS.

29
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Elodie, I know it's probably
too late now, but...

30
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
forgive me.

31
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,440
Now you have a voice message
from me admitting what I did.

32
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,960
Use it as you deem fit.

33
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,120
I'LL BE AT THE PIER
AFTER THE LAST BELL RINGS.
