1
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,400
Yes, Mom.

2
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,480
Benjamín said he'd be here
with his three kids.

3
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,320
They'll be in my class.

4
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,280
Don't worry.

5
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,600
Thanks. I love you.

6
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,920
Let's talk tomorrow.

7
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,120
It's a pleasure to meet you in person.

8
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,320
The pleasure is mine. Welcome.

9
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
I'll introduce you to my children.
Patrick.

10
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,520
PEEP INTO THE CLASSROOM.

11
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,680
GIVE ME TEN MINUTES.
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

12
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
REBE, SORRY TO BE A PAIN. CAN WE TALK?

13
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,480
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,040
HI, ARMANDO.

15
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,640
MAYBE WE COULD MEET ONE MORE TIME.
IF YOU WANT TO.

16
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,080
That's fine. Leave her.

17
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,640
I don't want anyone
to get expelled because of me.

18
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,480
No one should pay for their family's sins
because of who my family is.

19
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,840
It's a matter of control and security.

20
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,480
My family didn't ask for even half
of the measures you put in place.

21
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,080
<i>Besides, I've had the chance
to meet my classmates,</i>

22
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,000
<i>and I feel welcome.</i>

23
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,280
<i>I don't see any danger in them.</i>

24
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,560
Very well.

25
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,440
Which measures should I get rid of?

26
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,720
<i>The cameras, perhaps?</i>

27
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,560
<i>No, not the cameras.</i>

28
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,880
I'd prefer it if you kept them.
