Mm.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
I thought you said
Omar wouldn't be home till later.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,560
- He said he wouldn't.
- Well, fuck.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,240
What are you doing?
He won't go to bed for another half hour.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,320
This whole situation's
totally freaking me out.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,760
How do you think I feel?

24
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,720
But <i>I'm </i>the one who's having to lie
and move my plans around to see you.

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,440
What? Do you think
I don't wanna see you during the day?

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,800
That I don't wanna have a drink with you
or give you a kiss when I go to class?

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
I really don't know.

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,680
You want that?

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,520
Does it really matter?

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,560
Do you care how it feels to constantly see
you and Guzmán making plans together?

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,920
And then, I just get the leftover crumbs.

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,640
That means,
to you, this is just sloppy seconds?

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,000
- No, it's not.
- Then what is it?

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,160
Tell me, 'cause I'm not sure.
You're the one setting the pace here.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,480
You're coming and going.
It's all been your decision.

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,440
Well, of course it's my decision.

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm the one coming,
going, and essentially doing it all.

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,120
Because you just passively wait around
for others to do things.

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,200
Like when my dad got you out of the bar.

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,560
The hell does that mean?

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,240
It's obvious, Samuel.

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,400
You're always waiting for everyone else
to make your decisions.

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,520
Wake the fuck up and live your life.

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
You have the all-clear.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,240
You have the same.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,440
Start sticking your neck out a bit more.
Till then, you don't get to demand things.

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,160
Did you do it, Samuel?

48
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,680
I'd never hurt Ari.

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,000
Then I bet... you know who did.

50
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,360
Comin' through.

51
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,080
- Good morning, Benjamín.
- Good morning, Your Highness. Welcome.

52
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,120
- If you would come with me.
- I'll see you later, okay?

53
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,360
ARI, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REACT.

54
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,920
Hey. Morning, buddy.
Whoa. Relax, dude.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,560
- Jesus.
- Hold on. Wait.

56
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,800
What's wrong?
Put speed in your coffee this morning?

57
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,320
- No. Why?
- Have you seen Ari?

58
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,120
What? Why would...?
What do you mean, have I seen...

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,920
- What the hell's the matter?
- Huh?

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,480
Listen up, I need you to text her.

61
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Tell her you'll meet tomorrow
at the Lake Club.

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,360
- Why should I? She's your girlfriend.
- Because I wanna surprise her.

63
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,720
Do me this favor.

64
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
Say it's to talk
about the debate or whatever.

65
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,320
- Okay, but what should I write? I mean...
- Great. Thanks a lot, man.

66
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,640
Fuck.

67
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,240
SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE LAKE CLUB.

68
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
All done.

69
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,520
- Look, she's replying.
- Huh?

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
I said, she's replying.

71
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,960
- Let me see.
- What?

72
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Well, you just got a message.

73
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,760
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THE LAKE CLUB? DEBATE?

74
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,480
Just keep insisting you need to meet her
outside of the school.

75
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,520
- C'mon, tell her.
- Yeah, sure.

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
I'D RATHER MEET OUTSIDE SCHOOL SO WE CAN
TAKE OUR TIME PREPARING OUR ARGUMENT.

77
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,920
- All good.
- She's sending something.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,440
- Okay.
- Let me see.

79
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,200
- She answered.
- Let's see what she said.

80
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,920
- Shut up. I wanna hear what she says.
- No. It's my phone, dude.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
- Shh!
- What?

82
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,240
<i>Is that all?
Is that all you have to tell me?</i>

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,440
<i>As though last night never happened?</i>

84
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,680
"Last night"?

85
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,040
What happened last night?

86
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Hmm.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,360
Okay, well, um...
That's, uh, um... I mean, that's exactly...

88
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,320
What she's talking about there
is the debate.

89
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,320
It got heated,
and she wanted to apologize...

90
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,000
- Samuel.
- And it's no big deal.

91
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,680
I don't know what's wrong, but listen.

92
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,160
Make sure she comes.
That's all. Thanks, pal.

93
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,000
Man, oh, man.

94
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
You've been MIA since we saw Ambar.

95
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,680
You didn't miss me either.

96
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,200
- Jesus, Patrick.
- What?

97
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,720
Hey, I had a fuckin' awesome time. Thanks.

98
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,720
Well, I'm glad you did.

99
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,600
I know that look, dude.

100
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,360
I've felt that way a hell of a lot.

101
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,120
Well, I was a dickhead
and got too carried away.

102
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,520
Come on. You're not.

103
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
We've all lost our minds over someone.

104
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,320
- Or something.
- No.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't.

106
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,520
I always decide when,

107
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,280
how much, and how long.

108
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,640
That's great.

109
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,120
But Ander's very Ander.

110
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,720
When he wants you,
you feel like the king of the world.

111
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,200
But when he shuts down
or tosses you aside...

112
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,560
Come on. Cheer up, man.

113
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,360
You'll be back
to fuckin' everything that moves soon.

114
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,160
Hey, so, well, I've been thinking

115
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
that it'd be a good idea
for you to leave Armando's hotel room.

116
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,520
I mean, don't you think?

117
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,440
Why? I thought he didn't mind.

118
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,920
No, he doesn't, but...

119
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,400
It's just...

120
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,320
...I'd rather not have anything to do
with him anymore.

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,120
- That's all.
- See.

122
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,040
I knew it.

123
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,520
He left the concert 'cause you fought.
What did he do? I'll smash his face in.

124
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,440
It's nothing.
He just gets really annoying and intense.

125
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,760
Don't worry about it, kay?

126
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm sure my old lady
won't slam the door on me.

127
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,840
But if she makes me choose,
I know what I'd do.

128
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,400
Like, I'll go live under a bridge.
I don't even care.

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,520
So, um...

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
...why don't... we make the most of

131
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,280
this last night at the hotel?

132
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,880
Um, okay.

133
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,640
I mean, if you want to.

134
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,480
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

135
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,520
Which bridge
do you think you'll live under?

136
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,640
- Hey, I'll come up with one.
- Sure you will.

137
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,120
A school full of girls from good families,

138
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,520
all waiting for my son to look at them,

139
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,240
and he falls for the janitor?

140
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
She wants to be a fashion designer.

141
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
She's a very bright and intelligent girl.

142
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,720
I know that sort of intelligence.

143
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,960
I've seen it in all the other
Little Miss Nobodies after him.

144
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,720
Cayetana will behave
and stick to the path set for her.

145
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,080
How do you know that?

146
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,800
She has shown unconditional support
for her boyfriends before.

147
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,320
She'll be with him no matter what.

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,800
She has everything to gain.

149
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,080
- They're mine.
- Are you sure?

150
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Yes.

151
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,280
Wow, Phillipe.

152
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,320
They're pretty good. <i>Very </i>good.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
I mean, a prince, a designer, <i>and </i>hetero?

154
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,760
You'd be my mythical Prince Charming
if you weren't a predator.

155
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Ciao.

156
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,280
They're not mine, though.

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
Then whose?

158
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,760
Caye, you forgot this.

159
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,040
- Where were they?
- In the printer.

160
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,680
Ah, okay. Thanks. Anyone else see these?

161
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,840
I don't know.

162
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,240
Me. What's the matter?

163
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,080
Are you afraid I'll tell the principal
you're using school equipment

164
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,960
without permission, Cayetana?

165
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,240
No.

166
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,200
Snitch on me, then. I don't care.

167
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,760
They're very good.

168
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,720
Ari told me that.

169
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Oh, really?

170
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,320
To be fair, I thought they were his.

171
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,960
And for something a prince
was doing on a whim, they weren't bad.

172
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay.

173
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,360
What?

174
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,600
He heard your message.

175
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,480
- Guzmán?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,440
Why'd you ask me
to meet up about the debate?

177
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,920
He's planning a surprise.
He'll be the one at the club tomorrow.

178
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,040
You wanted me to take a stance, and I am.
But for my friend.

179
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,640
I can't keep sneaking around

180
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,200
and repeatedly stabbing him in the back
like this.

181
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,640
It's Guzmán or me.

182
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,400
Now take a stance and make up your mind.

183
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,320
You'll throw a New Year's Eve party.

184
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,280
The media will be there,
and there'll be a photo shoot.

185
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,520
I want you to invite all your friends.

186
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,280
You can bring that girl if you want.

187
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Cayetana.

188
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,960
So, Benjamín filled you in.

189
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,440
Do you really like her?

190
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Very much.

191
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,520
Have you at least given
other girls a chance?

192
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,680
I don't want other girls.

193
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,880
I want her.

194
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Fine, you'll introduce her formally
at the party.

195
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,920
That's part of your campaign
to clean up my image, right?

196
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,680
We're not together right now.

197
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,160
You mean you can't win
your peasant girl back?

198
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,720
Don't call her that.

199
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,600
Do you want her back or not?

200
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Yes, Mom.

201
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,840
Well then, do what you need to do.

202
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,960
What's happened to you here in Madrid?

203
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Hmm?

204
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,520
I don't recognize you anymore.

205
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,920
- Why are you here?
- Just visiting my friend.

206
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,320
Sure, I'm not busy.

207
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
Want a Mahou?

208
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Okay. In the room with the fireplace?
It's quieter there, okay?

209
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,800
Guys, we have a guest.

210
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,320
This is Armando.

211
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,560
Alumni president
and a former student at Las Encinas.

212
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,160
He just came by to make the association's

213
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,720
very generous annual donation
to the school,

214
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,360
and he wanted to meet all of you.

215
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,600
No, we already know him.
Isn't he your friend from the concert?

216
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,080
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh.

217
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,640
Uh, you're friends?

218
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,080
We've bumped into each other
while having drinks.

219
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,440
- I see.
- How are you?

220
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,960
- Hi.
- Hello.

221
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,280
Yeah, Patrick and I get along well.

222
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,560
And no, it's not your business.

223
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't know
if you guys intend to take things further.

224
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,560
Actually, no. It's not important to me.

225
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, to be totally honest,

226
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,280
I wasn't planning on it,
but thank you for your indifference.

227
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,960
If I didn't know better,
I would say you're a little bit jealous.

228
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,520
What the fuck?

229
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,680
I know you,
and I think you're <i>very </i>jealous.

230
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,400
It's not jealousy. It's concern.

231
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Excuse me?

232
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,000
Omar, Patrick cozied up to you
two seconds after I pissed him off.

233
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,240
- Just sayin'.
<i>- ♪ Lie next to me ♪</i>

234
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,880
<i>♪ Lie next to me... ♪</i>

235
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
I cozied up to Patrick.

236
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,800
Mainly 'cause you left him
in a fucking shambles.

237
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,520
Not my fault
if the guy has an imagination.

238
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,760
Uh, yeah, no.
It was a little bit your fault, honestly.

239
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,640
Patrick may be intense,
but he's not a dumbass.

240
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,640
Omar, I'm just asking you
not to get your hopes up.

241
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,160
'Cause you're really into him,
but all he wants is to get even.

242
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,560
The hell?

243
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Omar.

244
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,560
So, he hit on you
because you're such a catch,

245
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,720
but I'm just a rebound?

246
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,680
You've got guts.

247
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,800
Look, I'm just worried about you.

248
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,720
No, really, you've got a lot of nerve
to go around making one-sided decisions

249
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,600
and getting upset when I try to get over
the damage you've done.

250
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
I'm not upset.

251
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,800
You're like the dog in the manger.

252
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,000
You don't want me, you don't want Patrick,

253
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,560
but you also don't want us to build a life
without you.

254
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,280
If I'm just your buddy
and Patrick was a booty call,

255
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,920
why don't you just let us
do our own thing?

256
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,040
Leave. I have to work.

257
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,880
<i>♪ You and I are missing halves ♪</i>

258
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,080
We've always had rules.

259
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
You're telling me
they're more oppressive now than ever.

260
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,360
I'll tell you there were way more rules
in my day.

261
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,800
Before, people will say,
in their day, there were even more.

262
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,840
And so on, ad infinitum.

263
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,880
Well, I doubt when you were studying

264
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
at Las Encinas,
it felt so much like a... a bunker.

265
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,880
Even back then, it was very strict.
Trust me.

266
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,120
You had to do a balancing act
to skip class or break a rule.

267
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,720
The previous principal
had kinda loosened the rules.

268
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,160
But now
my father's reinstating them all, right?

269
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Hmm.

270
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
If you'll excuse me for just a second.

271
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Sure.

272
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,800
Mencía?

273
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Yeah?

274
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,880
You okay?

275
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,840
I'm great.
Never been better, Benjamín. Why?

276
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,696
- Thought you were a vegetarian.
- Look, I'm not making anything up.

277
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,520
Everything, then.

278
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,120
- I need to use the bathroom.
- What's gotten into her now?

279
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,400
What the actual fuck
are you doing in my house?

280
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,000
- Your dad asked me to stay for lunch.
- In general. Before that.

281
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,160
Why'd you show up
at my house in the first place?

282
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,560
I always deliver the annual donation.

283
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,400
Armando, don't give me that shit.

284
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,240
You could've easily given it to him
at the school or a fucking bar.

285
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,160
But you showed up here, so tell me why.
To fuck me over?

286
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,440
Me? Fuck you over?
What are you talkin' about?

287
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,840
You think you can blackmail me
so you can fuck me forever, don't you?

288
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,000
It really pisses you off

289
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,440
that you can't have me
whenever you want, I guess.

290
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,400
You can't end a relationship
over a tantrum.

291
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,920
You and I don't have a relationship!

292
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,680
So, we can talk about the menu
for the remainder of the week later on.

293
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,280
That'll be all for now.

294
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,320
- You've been tense since you saw him.
- Yeah, well, I'm tense by nature.

295
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,280
- Will you tell me what's goin' on?
- Nothing. We're friends. I told you.

296
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,240
How do a minor and a former alum
three times her age become friends?

297
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,520
We told you already. We met at a bar.

298
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm gonna sit back down.

299
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Honey.

300
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,560
What?

301
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,440
I know that our rapport
is pretty much, uh, nonexistent.

302
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,200
And when we do talk,
it's a declaration of war.

303
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,480
I think you can deduce that...

304
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,000
...even if I don't tell you...

305
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,040
Well, I don't want you to deduce.
I want you to <i>know</i>

306
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,240
that if there's something happening to you

307
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,240
or you're worried about something
or you have a problem,

308
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,760
well, you could tell me.

309
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,680
And with just one phone call,

310
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,760
I can get rid of, uh,
whatever it is that's the problem.

311
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,680
For you or your brother and sister.

312
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,920
That's good to know.

313
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,800
If... If I need that call,
I'll be sure to... let ya know.

314
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Okay?

315
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,760
Okay. I've talked too much already.
Now your turn.

316
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,040
What are you doing after graduating?

317
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,960
You have to join the alumni.

318
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,400
Well, honestly, I would love
to join the alumni association.

319
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,360
Oh yeah.

320
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,120
And have Armando
introduce us to his old classmates.

321
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,776
- Nothin' beats a boomer.
- Patrick!

322
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
You have such a one-track mind!

323
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,640
<i>I'm going to tell my father,
and it's going to fuck up your life.</i>

324
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,520
A bunch of old guys
in a room, lookin' back on their lives.

325
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
Who knows
what they get up to in there?

326
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,720
<i>Everything?
Even how you've been making a living?</i>

327
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,840
<i>Accept it. You are mine.</i>

328
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,320
You're so annoying.

329
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,720
How is it, Armando?

330
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,080
I hope everything's to your liking.

331
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,600
Everything's perfect, Benjamín. Thank you.

332
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,480
How have my kids been treating you?

333
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,880
It seems you've really... hit it off,
haven't you?

334
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,120
Your children are a pleasure.

335
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,080
A toast.

336
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,720
- Sure.
- Oh, yes.

337
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,760
- But it's bad luck to toast with water.
- Not with water. Come on.

338
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,680
Well, that's what you're getting,
all right?

339
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,400
I WANT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT

340
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,840
WHAT TIME SHOULD WE GO TO THE HOTEL?

341
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,840
I'M SORRY, REBE. I CAN'T GO.

342
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,840
I'M SORRY, REBE. I CAN'T GO.

343
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
Yes?

344
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,240
- Hi.
- Hello.

345
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,160
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, come in.

346
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,360
It's just that my mother decided

347
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,240
she wanted to come here
and spend Christmas with me.

348
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,360
Uh-huh.

349
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,520
And since it seems
she can never have an empty schedule,

350
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,400
she's putting together a networking event
with young entrepreneurs.

351
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,160
A get-together
to strengthen business ties and all.

352
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,080
Oh. Hmm.

353
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,000
How fun. Yippee.

354
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,520
Uh, I requested
that she invite our seed designer.

355
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,600
- Ah, Sadelagu?
- Mm-hmm.

356
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,280
Wait, wow.

357
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,280
Is Sadelagu really gonna be there?

358
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,760
- Yeah.
- Oh.

359
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,520
I don't know. I was hoping
that maybe you'd like to come with me,

360
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,040
meet him in person,
and show him your designs.

361
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,720
Okay,
you're... you're joking right now.

362
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,360
No. You have talent, Caye.

363
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,320
Thank you so much, Phillipe.
I... I don't know what to say.

364
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,280
Say nothing.

365
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Really, thanks a lot.

366
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,920
So, is that a yes?

367
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,120
Dress code?

368
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
Hello. Good evening.

369
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,880
Cayetana Grajera.

370
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Thank you.

371
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
I think I'll leave you alone.

372
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,440
- Where can I find your father?
- He's over there, schmoozing.

373
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,240
Wow. Christian Dior?

374
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,480
Grajera Pando.

375
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,040
Wow.

376
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,280
Yeah.

377
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,120
To be honest, I never imagined
I'd meet Sadelagu at such a solemn affair.

378
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,280
Dreams come true wearing charcoal gray
and holding a tumbler.

379
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Hmm.

380
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Hey, look.

381
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,080
- Is that...?
- That's him.

382
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,080
- It's him?
- I'll get him.

383
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,720
Okay.

384
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Really?

385
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,960
You'll enter the lion's den
to make sure you get what you want.

386
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,520
He invited me without my asking.

387
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,000
Sure.

388
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,880
And leaving your designs
out in plain sight?

389
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,280
Just coincidence?

390
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Yeah, it actually was.

391
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,600
You were very quick
to get over your doubts about him.

392
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,200
There's not a foolish hair on your head,

393
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,640
but you're stupid.

394
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
And a climber.

395
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,040
You're just a stupid climber.

What the fuck is this?

404
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,960
If you don't mind.

405
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,200
So, do you like it?

406
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,360
It's delicious.
I've never tried it.

407
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,400
Fashion, I'm told,

408
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,440
is what brought you
and Phillipe together, right?

409
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,720
Yes. And especially
our mutual admiration for you.

410
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,400
- Oh, come on.
- But anyway...

411
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,960
Sorry. I had to.

412
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,640
Really. Meeting you is a dream come true.

413
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,240
Mm-hmm.

414
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,160
Charge it to room 973.

415
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's on me.

416
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,040
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you have maybe five minutes?

417
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,680
I'd love to show you
some of these sketches I made.

418
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Sure.

419
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Really?

420
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,360
I have all the time in the world for you.

421
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,920
The thing is, I'd rather take a look
at them in my room, you know?

422
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,400
It's just,
I find it way more comfortable and quiet.

423
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,680
- Uh...
- What do you say?

424
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,040
Why are you with him again?

425
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,120
Rebe, look. I'll explain later, okay?

426
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,440
What do you mean, "later"?

427
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,640
Is this how you show
you want nothing to do with this dude?

428
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Mencía.

429
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,640
I need you to go now.

430
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,520
Come on.

431
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,680

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,040
Yeah. Hell no, I'm not going away.

437
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,880
Mencía, let's go.

438
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,880
Mencía, what is this?

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,960

442
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,520
I'd rather send my designs
to your workshops

443
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,360
and we'll talk whenever you're available.

444
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,200
Everyone,
here are your New Year's Eve invitations.

445
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,400
I'm so excited to start the year with you.

446
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,200
Samuel.

447
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,440
<i>I just don't understand, Mencía.</i>

448
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,640
<i>You wanted nothing to do with him,
and now you're together again?</i>

449
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,720
That's how I am. Capricious and volatile.

450
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,960
Ander.

451
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,160
Well, maybe it's true.

452
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,680
I mean, you and I've gotten closer
tryin' to forget him.

453
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,920
Now let's forget him, okay?

454
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,400
- What?
- Your invitations, guys.

455
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,920
I WANT TO START THE YEAR WITH YOU.
PHILLIPE

456
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,920
What are your rates like, Cayetana?
For designing a dress, not mopping.

457
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,760
I want a dress for New Year's Eve,
and I'd like to look truly spectacular.

458
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,920
Well, I'd have to crunch some numbers.

459
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Two grand? Not including materials.

460
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,040
What are you up to?

461
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
You have talent.

462
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
And dignity.

463
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,240
Plus, the 2,000 euros
are a tax-deductible donation.

464
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
God, I can't stomach you.

465
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,400
Cayetana,
I want your talent, not your friendship.

466
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,640
So, yes or no?

467
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,960
- I'll start concepts and get back to you.
- You have three days.

468
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,520
I only need two.

469
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,200
Oh, and I want a 10% bonus
for every 500 likes you get.

470
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Five percent.

471
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,760
- No, no.
- Omar.

472
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,040
- No.
- Yes.

473
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,680
Come on.

474
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,280
I said no.
No way we're gonna fuck here, Patrick.

475
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,880
No, it's just a spell. I'm an exorcist.

476
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Yeah, a spell, my ass.

477
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
Ander?

478
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,120
I don't know any Ander.

479
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,520
So, have you forgotten him?

480
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
It's cool.

481
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,400
<i>Poco a poco. </i>Hmm?

482
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,080
Trust me, Ander's not forever.

483
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,040
Oh, baby.

484
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Do you know

485
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,720
one of the thousands of ways
you and I are the same?

486
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,000
Without fail,

487
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,560
it doesn't matter if the people
we love hurt us again and again

488
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,080
and again and again,

489
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,280
we never leave their side.

490
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,760
We keep letting ourselves get punched
in the gut and take it like champs.

491
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,160
Bam, bam, bam!

492
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,920
For those we love, we'll do what it takes.

493
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,360
You and I are fighters.

494
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,280
But do you know how we're different?

495
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,640
I wait for the people I love...
to hit rock bottom,

496
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,880
alone and ashamed, and come back
with their tails between their legs.

497
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,880
But you're not like that.

498
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,240
You refuse to just sit by and watch
if you know they're about to hit bottom.

499
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,080
You don't give up, and you never stop.

500
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,480
And I think
that's one of your best traits.

501
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,520
Maybe you're me, but the improved version?

502
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,640
Hey, I said, "maybe."

503
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,880
Come here, sweetie.

504
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,000
Please, come in.

505
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,080
So, you go to Las Encinas?

506
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,976
- Yeah. We're in class together.
- Mm.

507
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,840
- Uh, I'm Patrick.
- Great.

508
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,840
- Uh, is Ander here?
- He is. Just a minute. I'll go get him.

509
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,320
Okay. Thank you.

510
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,240
Hey there, handsome.

511
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Patrick?

512
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,520
Patrick,
I think I'm a victim of butt-dialing.

513
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,400
Honey,
your friend Patrick is here to see you.

514
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,720
- Patrick?
- Yes, he's downstairs.

515
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,680
What's this about?

516
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,440
I'll tell you later, kay?

517
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,120
<i>Ander? How are you?</i>

518
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,880
What the fuck?

519
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,840
<i>Hey, can we chat for a sec?</i>

520
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,280
<i>Look, Ander, you really don't get it.</i>

521
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,560
You think
the whole world revolves around you?

522
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,720
It doesn't.

523
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,480
If I'm with Omar, it's because I like him
and I wanna pursue something.

524
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,080
And if that pisses you off,
then honestly, that's <i>your </i>problem, dude.

525
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,480
<i>It's fine with me
if you two are together.</i>

526
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,920
<i>As long as you're honest
and don't hurt him.</i>

527
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,040
<i>- 'Cause Omar's not like me.
- I know. That's why I like him.</i>

528
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,200
No, I'm saying
he's someone you could really hurt.

529
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,120
Because he <i>does </i>have feelings for you.

530
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,080
And I hope you do too.

531
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,960
He's not just someone
to pass the time with.

532
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Unlike me?

533
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,200
That's right. I was... a palate cleanser.

534
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,800
To get rid of Omar's scent
with a couple of fucks and a few kisses.

535
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,440
Well, relax. I'm not like you.

536
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,640
<i>I only hope I can make him feel
half as good as he makes me feel.</i>

537
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,480
<i>Look, man.
If I hurt you, I'm sorry, all right?</i>

538
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,960
<i>I thought it was clear
that it was just sex.</i>

539
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,680
Because at least to me,
that was super clear.

540
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,680
'Cause I never had doubts
about my feelings for Omar.

541
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,520
Like, when I got cured,

542
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,120
I traded backpacking around the world
just to be with him.

543
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,600
I've always loved him.

544
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,200
<i>And I always will.</i>

545
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,560
<i>So, don't play mind games with him,
don't use him,</i>

546
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,680
<i>and, above all,</i>

547
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,200
don't you dare break his heart.

548
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,720
Don't worry.

549
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
You can answer your WhatsApps.

550
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,240
I'll get out of the way... forever. I swear.

551
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,040
Fuck.

552
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,720
Why the long face?

553
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
It's nothing.

554
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,160
Honey, when are you finally gonna tell me
what's going on?

555
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,760
Have I ever told you
how annoying you are when you shut down?

556
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,640
BEFORE I GO: MOM, GUZMÁN, OMAR

557
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,600
Thank you.

558
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,960
<i>♪ Dangerous animal
Eat all day, but you don't get full ♪</i>

559
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,320
<i>♪ Try as I may... ♪</i>

560
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,800
Hmm.

561
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,720
- What?
- It's good.

562
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
And you were against it
'cause it's not French.

563
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

564
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,360
But you should so serve it
at your New Year's Eve party.

565
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,520
Well, there's something else

566
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
I'd like to have
at my New Year's Eve party.

567
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,000
- Hmm?
- Or rather, someone else, I should say.

568
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,960
I would love it if you would come.

569
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,600
I am.

570
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,040
Yeah, but... as my date.

571
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,320
That sounds like a couples plan.

572
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,960
Yes. It is.

573
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,760
Except we're just friends, remember?

574
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,480
Yeah, but we're friends who are exes.

575
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,040
And exes...
can get back together for Christmas.

576
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,520
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

577
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,040
Don't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

578
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,480
No.

579
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,400
Something great just happened,
and that's all I really think about.

580
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,640
Is it something great...
that you'd be willing to share with me?

581
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,720
I <i>am </i>sharing it.

582
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,000
C'mon,
aren't things fine the way they are?

583
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,040
Yeah, sure.

584
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,680
- It's okay to change our minds, right?
- Calm down. We're just making out.

585
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,640
And I don't even know why.
Look, Phillipe, we'd better...

586
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Okay.

587
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,040
Wait.

588
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Stop.

589
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
What?

590
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,840
We'd better not.

591
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
Why?

592
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,920
Friends is better.
You sit there. I'll sit here.

593
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,920
But Caye,
I'm more certain than ever.

594
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,720
Yeah, and I no longer see you as an idol.

595
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,000
I don't have to swoon
when we're together, you know?

596
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,320
Yeah, but what if it's the idol
who does the swooning?

597
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,440
No, really, I mean it.

598
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,080
I think it's better
if we just be friends, okay?

599
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,680
Phillipe, stop.

600
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,440
Stop. Hey, I said stop.

601
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,360
You like to feel
you have power over me, huh?

602
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,840
- What?
- All girls do.

603
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,160
What are you saying? Stop.

604
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,880
Stop it, Phillipe.
Get off me. Get off me! Let me go!

605
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,720
I don't want to!
Okay, seriously, let me go, Phillipe.

606
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,600
Oh my God! Please, enough!

607
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,480
Stop! I already said no. I said, get off!

608
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,920
Shit.

609
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Cayetana!

610
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,360
My girlfriend's here.

611
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,200
Sorry I'm late
to my own freakin' surprise.

612
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,760
They decided to block the entrance
in the middle of December

613
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,600
so that they could prune or something.

614
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,160
Thank you.

615
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,840
- You all right?
- Yeah.

616
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,120
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

617
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,080
Why's this extra plate here?

618
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,640
I'll have them take it away.

619
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,520
Aren't you workin' today?

620
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,760
Hold on a minute.
You said he canceled on you.

621
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,800
What do you mean, I canceled?

622
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,240
Samuel, have a seat.

623
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,240
Wait, why should he have a seat?

624
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,800
Ari, can you tell me what's goin' on?

625
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,840
Guzmán...

626
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,920
I've been seeing Samuel.

627
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,400
Seeing him as what?

628
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,720
Was it or was it not Guzmán?

629
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,800
Samuel, are you listening to me?

630
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,600
I'm sorry to put you in this situation,

631
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,600
but I think what I have with Samuel
isn't just a fling.

632
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,040
Samuel, I've fallen in love with you,

633
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,080
and I don't wanna leave you.

634
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,800
But Guzmán,
I'm in love with you too.

635
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,640
Guzmán, look at me.

636
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,320
I don't wanna leave you either.

637
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,720
Look at me!

638
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,320
Listen, I know you're probably thinking
I'm crazy right now.

639
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,200
But I think that I'd be crazy if... if...

640
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,040
if I were to give up on either of you.
