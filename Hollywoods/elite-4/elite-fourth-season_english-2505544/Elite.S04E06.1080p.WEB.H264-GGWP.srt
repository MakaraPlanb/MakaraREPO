1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,000
Patrick.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,200
Patrick, no one could find you.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,680
Where were you when it happened?

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
LAKE CLUB

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,400
Samuel shouldn't prepare at our house.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,200
We should separate our academic
and personal lives.

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,320
I offered to work at the Lake Club

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,640
and the other venues
whenever they needed an extra hand.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,560
To be honest, I can use the money.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,960
I have to go change,
so let's pick up tomorrow.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,080
Why are you leaving?

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm late for work.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Okay, well, don't forget to go over
your arguments for tomorrow.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,080
Got it. Later.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,360
Well, I guess if <i>Samuel </i>says
we're done here, then we're done.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,560
Good job today, sweetheart.

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,560
Well, thanks.

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm very proud of you, Ari.
Wait for me in the car?

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,920
García left his keys behind.

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,520
I don't remember.

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,120
- Yeah, no. I imagine you wouldn't.
- Or maybe it wasn't worth remembering?

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
- No?
- No.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,560
Ciao.

39
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,600
Oh my God.

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,480
Why don't you just get a bullhorn
and get it over with?

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,120
Your mother's been calling you all night,
and I didn't say anything.

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,760
If you weren't so stubborn,
you could have slept in my bed.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,440
Sure, first we invade your house,
then it's your bed.

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,760
No way, dude. Okay?

45
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,440
I can find somewhere to sleep tonight,
so don't worry about it, kay?

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,200
No.
You're going back home. I'll stay here.

47
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,960
The sofa's not so bad for just one person.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,600
Rebe,
I'm not about to leave you all alone.

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,080
End of discussion.

50
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,720
You two. What are you doin'?

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,240
Omar, exams are just around the corner.

52
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,041
You can't keep skipping school,
'cause Benjamín's gonna...

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,040
Benjamín can go fuck himself.

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,720
You know you can't avoid Ander forever.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,240
Maybe not forever.
I'm going one day at a time.

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,080
And today, I'm avoiding him.

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,960
Well,
it's gonna be a super-exclusive party.

58
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,400
Ambar Lucid might be singing.

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,040
You like her? Wanna see her?

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,880
I'd kill to see her.

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
Phillipe!

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,640
Uh, is Ambar Lucid gonna be singing there?

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
No idea.

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
No way I buy that.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,480
You're buddies.
I've seen you liking each other's posts.

66
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,200
If you'll excuse me.

67
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,600
- Patrick, don't be annoying.
- Shh.

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,920
Your Highness,
if you're able to get us tickets,

69
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,120
this humble servant before you
will do whatever Your Grace desires.

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,160
Okay, I'll make some calls.

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,760
GOOD MORNING, HANDSOME...

72
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,280
MORNING. HOW'S THE PHONE?

73
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,320
GREAT. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU IN PERSON.
WANT TO MEET TONIGHT?

74
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
I really hope
Phillipe manages to get us tickets.

75
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,560
Of course he will.

76
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,320
But just for the record,
<i>I'm </i>the one who got them.

77
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,720
You... just make sure to wear a cute tie
so I can yank on it.

78
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,080
Do you think
this is any way to behave in class?

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,160
I've sent you a document
containing a questionnaire

80
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,800
about your career preferences
for the future.

81
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
This is for an internship program
we'll be using in the second semester.

82
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
Please fill it out.

83
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,320
So, not quite as bold
when your old man's around.

84
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,720
Honestly...

85
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,440
"Honestly," what?

86
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,960
Well, you think you have way more power
than you do.

87
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,080
You don't.

88
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,160
What the fuck are you up to?

89
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,680
Just so it's clear to you
that I always get my way,

90
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,560
whether in front of a prince or my father.

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Samuel.

92
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
How's Omar?

93
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,240
It's your life.

94
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,240
You can do whatever the fuck you want,

95
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,240
but be a little more careful in class.

96
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,040
'Cause this
might cost him the school year.

97
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,760
- García?
- Yeah?

98
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,040
The book I told you about.
I'd really love to hear your thoughts...

99
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,200
They get along
'cause of the debate team. That's all.

100
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,960
Come on.

101
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,520
- What are you doing?
- Benjamín, do you have a minute?

102
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,280
Yes. What's up, Nunier?

103
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,080
Well, I wanted to take you
and your children out for dinner tonight.

104
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,320
Hmm. And, uh,
what would be the reason behind it?

105
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,720
Well, uh, Ari's important to me,
and you're important to Ari,

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,560
so I thought
we could get to know each other better.

107
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,120
Problem is, it would be inappropriate

108
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,000
for the principal
to let a student invite him.

109
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,080
- Got it.
- But Guzmán's my boyfriend, Dad.

110
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,080
Uh-huh.

111
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,720
What I mean is,
we wanted to get the family together

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,440
and make a formal introduction.

113
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,160
Well, uh, then maybe, in that case,
it's my obligation to accept.

114
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,000
That's perfect. Then I'll see you all
tonight at the Lake Club.

115
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,720
- Mm.
- Bye.

116
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,920
You can't come in.

117
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,960
Phillipe, you can't just come in
when you feel like it.

118
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,680
Like you with my computer?

119
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,600
What was
that little look earlier all about?

120
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,840
Uh, what little look?

121
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,320
The one you gave me
after walking across the hallway

122
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,640
to eavesdrop
on our Ambar Lucid conversation.

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
You wanna go too?

124
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,080
Look, I already told you.

125
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,840
Playing hard to get
so I'll go after you, that's played out,

126
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,440
and it doesn't work on me.

127
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,000
Yet here you are.

128
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,400
Don't act all high and mighty.

129
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,080
Accept the fact
that you can't go without asking me.

130
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,160
No,
I actually can't go, thanks.

131
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,560
- Really.
- Yeah. Sure.

132
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,720
Just so you don't have to ask me.

133
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,040
Oh, that's right.

134
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,480
I'm that gold-digging groupie
only interested in getting stuff from you.

135
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Hey, you told me you didn't know
how to separate me from the prince.

136
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,520
Yeah, unlike your friends,
who are clearly doing a great job at it.

137
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Excuse me?

138
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,880
Well...

139
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,560
If you don't mind,
I have to finish getting changed.

140
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
You know?

141
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,560
YOU AND YOUR SELFISH FRIENDS.

142
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,160
Von Triesenberg.

143
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,240
What were you doing in the janitor's room?

144
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Nothing wrong.

145
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,480
Listen, I saved your hide
by bringing you here.

146
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,960
Yours and your family's.

147
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,440
Do you really think
I'm not watching your every move?

148
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,080
I was just talking to her.

149
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,280
In here, you are my responsibility.

150
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm not risking my neck
for you to revive certain rumors

151
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,840
you're supposed to have buried.

152
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,600
Is that clear?

153
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Excuse me?

154
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,760
Benjamín,
don't use that tone with me, okay?

155
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,360
Is that clear? Yes or no?

156
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,360
- You weren't that sick, huh?
- I can't miss work.

157
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,720
You can't miss school, either.

158
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,760
Benjamín asked about you.
He's hoping to get rid of you.

159
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,280
Just like his son.

160
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,920
Fine.
You won't have to worry much longer.

161
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,480
HEY, PATRICK

162
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,520
HOW ABOUT DINNER
AND DRINKS AT THE LAKE CLUB?

163
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
PATRICK - ONLINE

164
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,560
I'm gonna quit school.

165
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,480
What?

166
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah.

167
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm happy behind a bar.

168
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,600
It pays well, and I'm good at it.

169
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,200
You don't wanna quit studying...
just to stop seeing me.

170
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,360
Omar, just 'cause we're not together
doesn't mean I don't love you.

171
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,160
You know that, right?

172
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,800
I love you,
and that's all that really matters.

173
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,160
- I'm not so sure anymore.
- Yeah, well, I <i>am</i>.

174
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,360
I'll be here whenever you need.

175
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Okay?

176
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,800
Hey. Come here.

177
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,000
- You like portrait mode, huh?
- It's really cool.

178
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,040
Plus, it came out,
like, super masculine, see?

179
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,760
Yeah.

180
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,600
I COULDN'T GET THE TICKETS. SORRY.

181
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,920
- Oh, damn it.
- What's the matter?

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,080
Pfft. A guy from class
was gonna try to get us tickets

183
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
to this really exclusive party

184
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,600
where Ambar Lucid
might possibly be singing,

185
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,040
but I guess he couldn't.

186
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't worry.
We can find a solution.

187
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,160
I guess. Maybe.

188
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,800
What's this guy doin' here?

189
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,400
- Hmm.
- The three of us are meeting for a drink.

190
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,880
- Okay? What would you like?
- He's paying for it.

191
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,360
And for the cell phone, too.
Of course. Snatch.

192
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,040
- Could you try not being against things?
- What'd she offer? A three-way?

193
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,520
I'd better leave you two here to...

194
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,720
- Yeah, you'd better.
- Armando, no. Stay.

195
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Kid,
why do you keep doing that shit?

196
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,280
- What shit?
- What? Making progress, then backsliding.

197
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,800
But Rebe...

198
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,520
- Can I ask what's going on?
- Wait here a sec. I'll be right back.

199
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,800
- Can you wait a minute and hear me out?
- Actually, fine.

200
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,480
You'll get literally a minute
so you can fucking explain.

201
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
Look, I'm just trying to help you, okay?

202
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,720
You really think
I'm that much of a fucking idiot?

203
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,480
I told you I quit because I quit.
I'm not a liar.

204
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,240
So do me a favor
and come back down there and listen to me.

205
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,040
Kay? Please do it for me.

206
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,160
Well, if you don't wanna accept
his offer of the hotel room,

207
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,280
what do you think we should do?

208
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,720
Because you were quick
to run away from home,

209
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,920
but as far as looking for alternatives,
not so much.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,880
Come on, kid.

211
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,760
I left my mom's house for you.
You realize that?

212
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,520
Just saying, the room's available to you
for as long as you need it.

213
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,680
It's on me, of course.

214
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,840
<i>♪ Like a cannibal, it's eating me away ♪</i>

215
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,800
- Should we wait for Mencía, or...?
- No.

216
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,240
All right.

217
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,600
Thanks.

218
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,560
- Don't call her. What's the point?
- She was invited too.

219
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,560
<i>♪ Watch its light... ♪</i>

220
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,800
- Fine. It's the host that calls the shots.
- Ring her up.

221
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
Disconnected or out of area.

222
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,040
Well, uh, Nunier,
do you want us to keep waiting?

223
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,560
Because, uh, I understand
they serve breakfast here as well.

224
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,200
Sorry, I was just trying to help.

225
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,040
- Didn't mean to interfere.
- Help with what?

226
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,720
It's obvious your relationship
with Mencía isn't the best.

227
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,600
I mean, fuck, these things
should be discussed openly, right?

228
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
No, no, no, no. It's all right.

229
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,280
I'd like to hear
what this dear Nunier of yours has to say.

230
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,480
Mencía's a lot like my sister.

231
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,200
She was intelligent, rebellious,

232
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,680
very passionate,

233
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,360
and very special.

234
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,520
The more my parents butted heads with her,
the more she rebelled.

235
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,120
Are you giving me parenting advice?

236
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,360
No.

237
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,480
No, really.
I mean, this is interesting.

238
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,840
Uh, please, tell me
how I should raise my daughter.

239
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Well, I don't know.

240
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,840
All I'm saying is that
maybe you should cut her some slack

241
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,560
and let her make her own decisions,

242
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
even if she'll screw up.

243
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,120
'Cause she has a right to screw up.

244
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,320
Mm. We all have that right. Hmm.

245
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,400
The thing is, you can cut kids some slack
when they actually behave.

246
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,680
But what if they can't? What's the point?

247
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,320
The slack you cut them is the rope
they'll use to hang themselves in the end.

248
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,880
It's like a swimming pool.

249
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,600
Someone's drowning,
and you jump in to save them

250
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,800
on impulse, with your best intentions,
your strength, and knowing how to swim.

251
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,360
But because of your desperation
to save her and her panic,

252
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,640
which keeps her from cooperating,

253
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
you'll end up sinking,

254
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,040
and she'll drown.

255
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,920
But if you had taught that person
how to swim,

256
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
to breathe,

257
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,760
to stay in control,

258
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
or if you'd just thrown them
a flotation device,

259
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,880
they probably would've saved themselves.

260
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,680
So, you gonna let this guy
on the debate team?

261
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,800
Or what?

262
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,240
I'd rather be
the guy waiting outside for Ari.

263
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Guzmán.

264
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,600
Were you thinking
of us all sharing something,

265
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,760
or should we each order our own thing?

266
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I want some as well.

267
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,120
You're gonna drink?

268
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Yes.

269
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,200
Tonight's a night to celebrate.

270
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,320
Well, I swear,
when you first began talking about Mencía,

271
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
I wanted to kill you.

272
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,240
Honestly.

273
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,400
But then, holy shit, you won him over.

274
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,880
Just like you did me.

275
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,160
That you talking,
or half the bottle of wine in you?

276
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,320
What?

277
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
- Okay, it's the half a bottle.
- Mm.

278
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,640
Ari, please,
we're in a restaurant. Don't.

279
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,520
Oh, I don't even care.

280
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Oh.

281
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,920
- Oh shit.
- You can't do that in here.

282
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hey, Samuel. Could you get lost?

283
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,480
Ari, please.

284
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,560
We're heading out, man. Sorry about that.

285
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,376
- Hmm?
- I'll go get our coats.

286
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,000
Samuel, is it this way?

287
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Good morning.

288
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,320
Good morning.

289
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,360
How long have you been awake?

290
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,080
Well, just to give you an idea,

291
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,960
basically the entire night, thereabout.

292
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Why?

293
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
I don't know
if it's a good idea for me to stay here.

294
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,400
Can't you enjoy something
for two minutes without freaking out?

295
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,360
A selfless john-slash-sugar daddy?
Doesn't add up.

296
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,440
- Did you order something?
- Why would I?

297
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,680
- Stop showin' off, you.
- No, I didn't order it. I swear.

298
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,840
He got us two tickets
to the Ambar Lucid concert.

299
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,800
No fuckin' way.

300
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,000
I told him I was bummed
we couldn't get tickets, and then...

301
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,800
- Pop!
- Okay, okay, hold on. Calm your tits.

302
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,400
It's just a rumor that she'll be there.
Who knows who'll show up in the end.

303
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,640
You're really pissed off

304
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,920
that you're starting
to like Armando, right?

305
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,120
Stop. I said no.

306
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,480
You know someone.
Like, you're a fucking prince.

307
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,320
You're the son
of one of the most important businessmen

308
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,120
in Europe, and here you are, begging.

309
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,720
Phillipe, come on.

310
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,360
It's a way that we can all hang together.
You don't want that?

311
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,080
I would rather have had dinner
with you last night,

312
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,040
but we can't always get what we want.

313
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,560
Pfft.

314
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,920
- Oh shit.
- Hello.

315
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,200
- Hey. What's up?
- Hey.

316
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,160
- You could let Dad know where you've been.
- I already told Patrick, Ari.

317
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,280
Man, I really missed you douchebags.

318
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,520
- Right on.
- Well, well, look who's returned.

319
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Oh, this is great, man!

320
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,080
- Hey.
- Good to see you.

321
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,240
Thank you.

322
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,960
Oh yeah?

323
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,320
It's okay. We can do it. It's our place.

324
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,920
I like it that way. Yeah.

325
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,360
When we get there, let's make sure
we have time to do everything we planned...

326
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,560
- Morning, ladies.
- Oh, hi.

327
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,400
- All right, I should probably go to class.
- No, no, no, please. Parrilla, stay.

328
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,680
I want you to sleep at home.

329
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,440
And if Parrilla has nowhere to go,
if she wants, then,

330
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,040
well, she can come over
and stay in a guest room.

331
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,680
Hmm. I was wondering
where you had the hidden camera,

332
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,920
as if we didn't already have
enough cameras.

333
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,680
- What?
- I mean, it's better than where we are.

334
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,240
I'll have you know we're just fine
sleeping in the same bed.

335
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,400
But thanks a lot, Benjamín.

336
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,040
- We can listen to his offer and consider...
- Let's go.

337
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,000
Anyway, thanks a lot.
It was very thoughtful, Ben... Benjamín.

338
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,560
Sorry I couldn't meet up.

339
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,680
Or reply, from what I saw.

340
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,040
Slipped my mind. I'm sorry.

341
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,200
But you don't forget the tickets.

342
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,240
You'll hunt me
to the ends of the earth for those.

343
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,600
- But anyway, it...
- it doesn't matter.

344
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,880
In fact, I'm the one who has to change

345
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,440
the way he interacts
with people moving forward.

346
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,280
I have to lose the fanfare
and stop treating everyone.

347
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
Why?

348
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,840
I want to see how many friends I have left
if I get rid of the prince.

349
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,240
But what's the problem
with being who you are?

350
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,120
You were born to your station.

351
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
This Phillipe is the result of his palace,
his fortune, his education,

352
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,600
his family and his friends.
All his riches.

353
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,320
And his wonderful royal genes
played a part.

354
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,040
- Why would you get rid of all that?
- To see who really wants to be in my life.

355
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,160
What am I?

356
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,920
Am I a fake friend?

357
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,160
All this is is a friend asking a friend
for a favor

358
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,640
that I know he can pull off
because of who he is.

359
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,720
A little bit like,
well, I guess, my father.

360
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,560
Because of who he is, he can help you

361
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,160
and bring you here to keep you
away from the rumors in your country.

362
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,120
Excuse me?

363
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,560
If you haven't noticed,

364
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
it's always the same four people
at every event.

365
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,240
But hey, don't worry.
Here, only my dad and I know.

366
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,720
Well, and Ari, because I told her.

367
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,080
And as a person
with the privilege of being your pal,

368
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,920
I'm asking you kindly
to please help me get tickets

369
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,960

370
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,920

Not the violence, the pain.

What kind of pain can justify
hurting someone you care about?

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,080
It doesn't justify it,
but I get how such terrible pain
