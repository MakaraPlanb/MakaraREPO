00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,320
How are you?

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,040
Who did this?

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,480
Shh. Relax, sweetheart.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,880
The doctors are confident
you'll recover your memory over time.

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,720

Finally, after 20 years, I get to sleep
with a girl from Las Encinas.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,440
But I had to pay.

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,200
- I went to your school, too.
- Oh, really?

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
Yeah.

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,640
And don't worry.
Some of us come out of there all right.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,920
Hey, mind if I share your number?

20
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
With who?

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,680
My buddy.

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,440
I raved about you.

Actually, I do.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,560
But it's gotta be in this room, though.
Everything included.

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,560
- So, the same as with me?
- No. Not the same.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
'Cause your little buddy pays double.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,920
I want you to join the debate team.

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,880
You did a nice job defending Shanaa
when I first got to this school.

41
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,560
I think you've got talent.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,320
And if you choose to apply it
to serving noble causes, well,

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,440
you could one day become...
a brilliant lawyer, for instance.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm sorry,
but I don't want to be a lawyer.

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
Getting there would mean
you'd have to work hard, consistently,

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,720
every day after class.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,200
Wait, hold on. I can't. After school,
I work every day at the Lake Club.

48
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,080
Hmm. You'll have to quit.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
How much do they pay?

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,600
Why?

51
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,920
Las Encinas
is capable of offering you 25% more

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,720
for completing
assorted administrative computing tasks.

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
The hours would be compatible
with the debate team.

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,520
If you don't mind me asking,
well, uh, are you tryin' to help me?

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
- He said I'm really good.
- He's got ulterior motives.

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,840
They don't offer this sort of thing
to people like you.

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,800
- What do you mean by that?
- Come on, Samuel.

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,680
Two days ago, he wanted to kick you out
'cause you weren't worthy.

59
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,360
So what's your point? He just said
I could become a great lawyer.

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,960
- Yeah, and you believe him, right?
- Fuck you.

61
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
- What are you saying?
- Samuel.

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,440
- Come on, let's go. Go on.
- C'mon. Don't be pissy with me.

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,040
Hey. What's up, Gonza?

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
Samuel, make sure Mencía stays out there.

65
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,680
- Why?
- I'm gonna give her a surprise.

66
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
Uh... What the hell is this?

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,040
The key to suite 428.

68
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,520
"Gran Hotel Brenwhorf."

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
For tomorrow?

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,720
Oh, shit.
Why didn't I switch to girls way earlier?

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,640
Come on. I don't think I was that bad.

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,240
Know what?
Actually, now that I look back on it,

73
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,760
ya done fucked up.

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,480
Busy tomorrow night? I'm free.

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,840
We said today. I have plans then.

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,840
Ah. Who are you seeing
that you can't move around for me?

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,320
I can do today. <i>Mañana</i>, no.

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Forget it.

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,560
I can't meet tomorrow, either.

80
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,920
Almost done. Give me a minute.

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,400
Coffee?

82
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,280
You think that's all you have to do?

83
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
I erased it.

84
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,320
Your video.

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,120
I did it this morning.

86
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,016
You can't erase that you recorded
without my permission.

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,920
But I am telling you, it wasn't personal.
I swear.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,680
I can't trust anybody.

89
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,120
Look, Phillipe.
We should end things here,

90
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,680
because it was never gonna work out
between us.

91
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,960
You're a prince,
and I'm just... the fucking janitor.

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,200
There's no planet
or parallel universe

93
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
where you and I
would have ever worked out together.

94
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,600
Even before you recorded us.

95
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,600
Let me make it up to you.

96
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,640
Just let me...
let me prove to you that behind the title,

97
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,760
there's a real person.

98
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
Maybe I'm not interested in that person.

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,120
What if I was just drawn to that person
because he was a prince, but that's all?

100
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,640
And you were just drawn to me
because I was easy prey.

101
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
- No.
- Yes.

102
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,160
- Just another groupie, right?
- No.

103
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Cayetana...

104
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
End of story.

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,080
You go your way. I'll go my way.

106
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,160
We're more secluded in the books
than in the showers.

107
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,200
Stop. No more.

108
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,760
I'm not doing anything.

109
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,840
Am I gonna have to beat it into you?

110
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,400
Relax just a little, will you?

111
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,720
It was just sex, not a marriage proposal.

112
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,800
You could care less, 'cause you have
no one that you might really hurt.

113
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Ander.

114
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,880
Look, whatever Omar's deal is,

115
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,040
we can talk our way through it.
The three of us, like adults.

116
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,280
Yeah, sure.

117
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,360
Why would he want to see you,
when he won't even see me?

118
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,920
Well,
we can at least try, right?

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,560
Just set up a time for the three of us
to meet, and I'll sort this thing out.

120
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,200

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,320
Doesn't matter what you were gonna say.
What's wrong with me? Huh?

170
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,600
Tell me. I want to know.

171
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,840
Am I too much or not enough?

172
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,960
You would know,
since you fooled me like she did.

173
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,200
I'm really sorry, but...

174
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,040
but sometimes people make mistakes,
and it has nothing to do with you.

175
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Yeah.

176
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,680
It's not about what you do or don't do.
It's entirely our fault.

177
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,720
The fact that the rest of us are assholes
doesn't mean you're defective or bad.

178
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,520
The opposite, actually.

179
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Hey.

180
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,160
You're the most fucking awesome girl
out there.

181
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,280
If you can hold on to one thing,
hold on to that.

182
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,560
Maybe you won't be so bad,
on second thought, with that debate thing.

183
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
Ice cream sound good to you?

184
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,120
I want, like, a shit ton.

185
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,240
- Good, 'cause we got chocolate.
- Fuckin' awesome.

186
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,800
Yeah, that was something
my dad always told me.

187
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,160
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Hey, man.

189
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,000
Evening.

190
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,640
- Evening.
- Do you have a reservation?

191
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,960
- Yeah.
- Yes.

192
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
You look great.

193
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,160
- Thanks. That's nice.
- Can you take our coats?

194
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Thanks, Samuel.

195
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,800
- I'm out.
- No, Omar.

196
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Listen.

197
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,840
There's no way I can go to bed now.
I mean, I'm high as shit.

198
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,400
That sounds like <i>your </i>problem, Ander.

199
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,880
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll be his babysitter.

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400

00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Omar!

202
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,720
Hey, just try a little. It's fun.
I promise you'll like it.

203
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I said no.

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,040
Please, Omar. Listen to me.

205
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,240
Take whatever you want and leave me alone.
Why's that so hard to get?

206
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,600
Well, hey.
At least look on the bright side.

207
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,320
- Now there's more for you and me.
- I don't want more, man.

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,120
I need you to do me a favor.

294
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,200

295
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Hangover.

296
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,400
Wait, you went out?

297
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,360
I thought you said
you couldn't hang out last night.

298
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,840
Who are you seeing later?

299
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,080
Um, I told you
I'm just doing some odd jobs

300
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,160
so I don't have to depend on Benjamín.

301
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
Yeah, like what?

302
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,000

303

Mencía,
you can't keep doing this.

304
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,360
Dad doesn't want you seeing Rebeka.
Stop adding to the tension.

305
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,600
Children aren't to blame
for the way their parents choose to be.

306
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,120
The same goes for Rebe.

307
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,720
Hello?

308
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,360
Okay.

309
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,600
- Hi.
- Hey there.

310
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,360
- Want to go?
- No. Come say hi to my dad.

311
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,520
I know.

312
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,600
Why are you here?

313
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,480
Mm, I have a meeting with your dad
about the debate team.

314
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,280
Why couldn't you meet at school? Why here?

315
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,080
Um, Benjamín requested it.
What's goin' on?

316
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,320
You sure?

317
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,680
- Mm, never mind.
- Samuel.

318
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,600
I was actually worried
you'd changed your mind.

319
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,920
- I almost did.
- Come in.

320
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,360
Uh, Dad. Say hello to Guzmán.

321
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,720
Of course. How are you? How's your family?

322
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,320
We're all great. Thank you.

323
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,080
- Uh, let's go to my office and talk.
- Sounds good.

324
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,480
Um, can I get a black coffee, Ari?
Want anything?

325
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,960
Me? Uh, if you could get me coffee
with a little milk, that'd be great.

326
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,360
I worked my butt off

327
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,760
at every job imaginable
to pay for my studies, too.

328
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
What?

329
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Thought I got everything
on a silver platter?

330
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,680
Well, uh...

331
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,160
I don't even remember my father.

332
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,960
- Yeah, I don't know mine either, really.
- Hmm.

333
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,640
Thankfully, I was given a scholarship
to a private university in London.

334
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,360
And well,

335
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,760
of course, I went back home ecstatic.

336
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,760
And my mother,
the first thing she said to me

337
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,640
was,
"Don't you ever forget that we aren't,

338
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,880
and never will be, like them."

339
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,000
"Like <i>them</i>," she said.

340
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,000
And from that day on,
I set out to prove that

341
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,720
there's no "us" and "them."

342
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,000
The future's decided
by someone's merits, Samuel.

343
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Right?

344
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm sure she was proud
of everything you did.

345
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,360
Just like your mother must be.

346
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Ah, Ari.

347
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,200
So you're going to be Samuel's partner.

348
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
His what?

349
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,320
You're gonna make a great match
on the debate team. I can tell.

350
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,720
Yeah.

351
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,000
Um, I'm going out with Guzmán.

352
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,440
Thanks for the coffee.

353
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,280
- She can't handle visitors.
- Yeah.

354
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
Go home.

355
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Huh?

356
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
I don't want you bothering her.

357
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,960
Hello?

358
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,200
<i>Hey, Cayetana.
It's Omar. How are you?</i>

359
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,440
<i>Hey, listen. So, I'm calling</i>

360
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,000
<i>just to confirm your table
for tonight at the Lake Club.</i>

361
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,160

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,520
- Good evening, miss.
- Omar, what's this about?

366
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,880
Why is there no one here?

367
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,040
Your table's ready.
Will you come with me?

368
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,280
- Omar.
- Here you are.

369
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,080
Welcome. Have a seat.

370
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Okay.

371
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,160
- Thanks.
- You look pretty.

372
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,960
- Omar, I'm leaving. This is absurd.
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>

373
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,520
- Good evening.
- Oh my God!

374
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,160
- An aperitif?
<i>- </i>Phillipe, what is this?

375
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,840
I don't mean to be rude, mademoiselle.
I think you've got the wrong person.

376
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm just your humble waiter.

377
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,680
I won't see you as anything different

378
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,880
just because you played a waiter
for me tonight.

379
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
- Is it to your liking?
- Are you listening?

380
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,160
<i>Mais non, s'il vous plaît.</i>
It's my first day.

381
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,080

385
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,200
Sorry for the inconvenience.
I'll bring you another. Anything else?

386
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,760
Oh, yeah. This napkin,

387
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
it's dirty.

388
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,040
I'm sorry.
I'll, uh, bring another right away.

389
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,720

Hmm.

Well,
I don't care about anyone else.

403
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,800

I just forgot who we were.

407
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,560
We were naked, and it was just us two.
And I forgot.

408
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,680

you'll manage to forget it, as well.

Let's go. Gotta get out of here.

422
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,320
We gotta clean this up
before our first reservation arrives.

00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,560
Come on.

424
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,280
And only because you are thinking it,
this isn't a third date, you know.

425
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,200
Oh no?

426
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
- No.
- Oh.

427
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,000
It's just some little performance
I put on like the total fool that I am.

428
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,920
Okay, great.

429
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,920
Actually, the third date
is gonna be back at my place.

430
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,560
If you're interested, of course.

431
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,560
- Yeah, I am.

433
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,760

434
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,600
Take it off for me.

435
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,760
Aren't you forgetting something?

436
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,800
That's one hour.

437
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
Then let's not waste any more time.

438
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,200
Pizza? No, we agreed on sushi.

439
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,880
- One of them has anchovies. Chill out.
- Dad, that's not fair. We said sushi.

440
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,200
Dad, come on.

441
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,600
Is that the way you'll be defending
your position in a debate?

442
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,000
- He's gonna clobber you.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

443
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,120
Where is Mencía?

444
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,200
She went out earlier.

445
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,560
Who'd she go out with?

446
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,800
With Rebeka, I think.

447
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,040
- And why did you let her?
- Because I can't...

448
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,400
- I didn't want her near that girl.
- Hold on.

449
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,560
Rebeka is one of the best people
I've ever known.

450
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,280
My daughter has 3,000 euros in her room.

451
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,200
What?

452
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,880
Where does a kid get 3,000 euros

453
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,760
when she's going out
with a dealer's daughter?

454
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,440
Can you connect the dots, García?
Or should I?

455
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,680
But she doesn't do
that sort of thing anymore.

456
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,240
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

457
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,440
- I have to answer it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

458
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,640
- Not right now.
- Um, look, man. Let go of me. Okay?

459
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
What?

460
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,920
I said I'm not into this game.
Please let go of me.

461
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,760
Enough of that, huh?

462
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,560
If you really want me to pay you,
behave like a professional.

463
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,040
Except I told you, I'm not a professional,
so let go of me.

464
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,840
Shh.

465
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,240
Uh, Patrick.

466
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,896
See if she's at the club
or if anyone's seen her there.

467
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,240
We'll go to Parrilla's house.

468
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,800
- She's not at Rebeka's house.
- Nobody asked for your opinion.

469
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,480
- I'll go get the car keys.
- I don't want you driving like this.

470
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,280
She's into something serious.

471
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,040
- Oh, please. I hope Guzmán isn't home yet.
- I can drive your father's car.

472
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,016
- I'm going with Samuel.
- What are you saying? No, no, no.

473
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,520
If she calls,
you have to be here to pick it up.

474
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Let's go.

475
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,320
- Patrick?
- Have you seen Mencía?

476
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,720
N... No. Haven't seen her all afternoon.
Patrick!

477
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,240
Get out. The fuck is this guy doing?

478
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,120
Yo, can I ask you what's going on?

479
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,080
- Fuck!
- Hey. Stop. Calm down.

480
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
You!

481
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,120
- Fuck, you scared me.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

482
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,160
- What?
- So now you're going after Omar?

483
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,320
What are you talking about?

484
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,600
First, you're in his bed,
then stalk him at his job.

485
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,960
- Is that how it works?
- My sister disappeared.

486
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,440
Right. You think I'm an idiot?

487
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,240
Listen, I'm not fucking lying.
Mencía's missing.

488
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,960
And you're not an idiot, just blind.

489
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,720
Omar came looking for me.

490
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,240
At the ball.

491
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,760
You fucked him at the ball?

492
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,560
He fucked me, to be precise.

493
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,880
You must think
our family's completely bonkers.

494
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,960
No, not really. My own family...

495
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,760
I mean,
we have good reasons to be the way we are.

496
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,920
When Mencía was a little girl,
she ran away from home,

497
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,760
and we didn't even realize it
until it was dinnertime.

498
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,040
So my mother grabbed Patrick
and went to look for her with the car,

499
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,880
and soon, it got dark out.

500
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,600
My mom started getting
more and more nervous,

501
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,320
and they got into an accident.

502
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,400
Patrick was bedridden for two years after.

503
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,240
My mom died instantly.

504
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Holy fuck.

505
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,960
My father still misses her every day.

506
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,640
- She had 3,000 bucks on her?
- Did you give it to her?

507
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,560
I didn't.
Who do you think you're talkin' to?

508
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,040
Mencía's not answering,
and we've been there two hours–

509
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,520
Are they worried about her?

510
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
I gotta run. Ari's in the car waiting.

511
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
Oh shit, the hotel room key.

512
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,840
Please, let me go.

513
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Hey... can... can we stop?

514
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,560
Are you even listening to me? Please?

515
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,520
Who is it?

516
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,840
Room service.

517
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,040
Uh, no, no.
We didn't order anything.

518
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,440
It's a bottle of champagne for you, sir.
Courtesy of the hotel.

519
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,640
Leave it outside.

520
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,000
Hey, I... I think maybe I could go
for a little bit of champagne.

521
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Hmm?

522
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,160
Who are you? Get the hell out!

523
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,520
What the hell is this?

524
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,760
Rebeka's calling me.

525
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,800
Mencía!

526
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,040
Where are you?

527
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,080
Okay, but are you all right?

528
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Oh my God!

529
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,080
Well, I'll see you at home, then.
Hurry back, okay?

530
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
See you there.

531
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,680
So, back to your house then?

532
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
Mm-hmm.

533
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,880
Hey, are you in the mood for pizza?

534
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Sounds good.

535
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,960
- It's not what it looks like.
- Oh, it's not?

536
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,120
Explain it to me then.

537
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,240
'Cause this
could only be one fucking thing, Mencía.

538
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,600
Please don't you treat me like that, too.

539
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Rebe...

540
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,440
you know I'm only doing this
so I can afford to get out of this place.

541
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,240
Hopefully, with you.

542
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,200
I'm sorry, kid.

543
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,880
Do you think
this is some kind of game, huh?

544
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,440
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a shit why you did it.

545
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,880
But that asshole could've done
all sorts of awful things.

546
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,280
Don't look at me like that.

547
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
I can't take it.

548
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Not from you.

549
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,160
Don't scare me like that ever again
in our fucking lives, you brat.

550
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,680
Ari.

551
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,360
- Samuel García?
- What? What?

552
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,560
- Come with us.
- What is goin' on?

553
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,520
- Let's go.
- What's going on? Ari?

554
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,120
Ari. What's going... Ari!

555
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,440
Ari!

556
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Ari!
