1
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,640
Bravo! You look great out there!

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
Sexy!

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,200
<i>I don't know
what came over me or what I was thinking.</i>

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
<i>I'll meet you in half an hour
at the pier on the lake.</i>

5
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>Please come and hear me out.</i>

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,680
- I never got that message.
- It looks like it was sent to me.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,200
I never got that message, I'm telling you!

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,280
'Cause it's not the same at all.

9
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
Why isn't it the same thing? Go on.

10
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,600
- Why?
- Because it was only sex for you.

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,400
So now you're hooked on him?
That's the deal?

12
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,440
No fuckin' way.

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,360
No fuckin' way, Omar.
Are you fuckin' kidding me right now?

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,240
Look, Ander... No. I... I mean... No, no.

15
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,560
This can't be.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,080
Please, man.
I'm fucking confused as hell. Ander!

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,600
- Let's go to the lake and talk, please.
- To talk about what?

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,320
What's there to talk about?

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,080
Rebeka's sleeping,
so go the fuck back home, okay?

20
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,800
- What are you doing? What's up? Hi.
- Hi.

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
Please move.

22
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,480
Believe me. I had no idea
what I was getting myself into.

23
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,000
You did it enough times.
You'd think you'd figured it out.

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,640
Rebe, I can't change something
that's already happened.

25
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,280
You know I desperately wish I could,
but that's not an option.

26
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,280
I can change my behavior from now on.

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,920
You serious right now?

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,960
Do you really think
I'd fall for that shit, huh?

29
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,760
When I got home,
I made up an excuse

30
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
they never even asked for

31
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,720
because you and I both know
they didn't care what I'd been doing.

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,040
They were just relieved to see you.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Well, yes.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,160
And I liked feeling... that sense of relief

35
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,080
because it's the same relief I felt
in that hotel room when you hugged me,

36
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,640
even after everything you saw.

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,480
No, wait up.

38
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,240
Come here.

39
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,240
Don't ever do that to me again.

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,600
<i>♪ Waiting in outer space ♪</i>

41
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,960
<i>♪ Wishing to touch his face ♪</i>

42
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,920
<i>♪ I'd tell it to his face ♪</i>

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,880
<i>♪ Dreamin' of you all day... ♪</i>

44
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
Have you seen Ari?

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,280
She told me
she would meet me here.

46
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,600
I would start
with a more personal approach,

47
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,320
<i>then </i>I'd go to the data.

48
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,200
Because data is boring.

49
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,000
It's really our emotions
that transcends it all.

50
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,320
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

51
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,720
How was your weekend?

52
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,360
- Uh, good. It was pretty nice out.
- Yeah.

53
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,280
How's Mencía? Did she open up?

54
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,600
- No. With her, it's best not to talk.
- Right.

55
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,560
Okay.

56
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,160
- All right, show me what you got.
- Okay.

57
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,440
No, no. Stay right there.
You're fine where you are.

58
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,560
I can go first if you want.
I'm really eager to.

59
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Very well.

60
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,320
Prisoner reentry is just a utopian ideal.
Experience has proven it.

61
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,560
It all depends on the prisoner's will
and choices, not on institutions.

62
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,280
I'd like to point out, we are the country
with the biggest percentage of prisoners...

63
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,760
- Not the most crime. They're not related.
- Whoa. This isn't casual barroom banter.

64
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,280
Wait your turn to respond,
and please don't raise your voice again.

65
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,720
We're the highest in all of Europe.

66
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,240
A hundred and twenty-six prisoners
for every 100,000 citizens.

67
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,000
And that, Samuel, is a fact.

68
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,440
A hundred twenty-six prisoners

69
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,080
with 126 families,
friends, and loved ones.

70
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,720
Prisoners have people close to them.
You've thought about that?

71
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,600
Of course I thought about it,
but that's not what we're talking about...

72
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,440
We are. It's not the kind of thing
you can just gloss over.

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,320
What's your focus? People or numbers?
What?

74
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,880
Numbers, so you can distance yourself
and dehumanize them.

75
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,560
I mean, imagining myself,
Samuel García, being dragged into jail.

76
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,000
Looking at a bunch of years ahead of me.

77
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,600
And imagining every Samuel García in jail.

78
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,880
My family and friends
might be able to help me,

79
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,280
but the system won't let them.

80
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Because after a stint,
all you'll ever be seen as is a felon.

81
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,680
And that's what happens
when you reduce people to labels.

82
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,040
You erase their humanity
in a single stroke.

83
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Same with numbers.

84
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,560
On that note, uh, I'm done.
Thanks for listening.

85
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,600
Okay, we need to refine it a bit.

86
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,400
But keep up the good work.

87
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,560
What on earth did you do all weekend?

88
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,080
It's best
that Samuel thinks he can beat me.

89
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
Well, I'm pretty sure
we just saw that he can.

90
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,120
And if that happened, well,

91
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,040
I would be extremely disappointed,
to say the very least.

92
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,440
You! Where were you Friday afternoon?

93
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,200
- Excuse me?
- Mm...

94
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
I said,
"Where were you Friday afternoon?"

95
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,000
Wow. Envy really isn't a good look on you,
Ivanka.

96
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,496
Isn't it enough for you to be fought over
by two guys already?

97
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,840
- I was with her.
- From what time to what time?

98
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,840
I don't know off the top of my head.

99
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,760
Um, yeah. Why the inquisition?

100
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,960
My sister had bruises on her body.

101
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,120
- "What time period?" I asked you.
- I have no idea.

102
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,600
He just told you we were together.

103
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,240
Well, just in case, don't go near Mencía.

104
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,840
Are we clear? Not at all.

105
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,440
No idea. Who knows what that was.

106
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,040
PHILLIPE VON TRIESENBERG ABUSE

107
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,120
NO RESULTS FOUND FOR YOUR SEARCH

108
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,200
Ari,
you shouldn't make false accusations.

109
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,800
I have my reasons.

110
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,640
Oh, well, if you're so sure he did that
to her, why don't you report him, then?

111
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,560
That's precisely why, Cayetana.
'Cause I don't have real evidence yet.

112
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,480
And I don't normally report people
without it.

113
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,720
- That's the kind of girl I am.
- Hmm.

114
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,960
Well, the girl
from his country didn't have evidence,

115
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,736
so I guess the both of you
must be the same kind of girls.

116
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,800
Honey.

117
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,160
Look, I totally get
that you're really into Phillipe and all,

118
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,040
and I never for a moment
said he doesn't like you back.

119
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,120
The thing is, it's not the same.

120
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Because you always expected a no
from a guy like that,

121
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,320
while he expected a yes.

122
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,840
People like Phillipe
don't understand the concept of no.

123
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm sticking my nose
in someone else's business,

124
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,120
but if I were you,
I wouldn't wait to have proof with him.

125
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,080
Maybe once you have proof,
it'll be too late.

126
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,040
If there's one thing
you and I have in common,

127
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,960
it's that we're both women, honey.

128
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,520
And if women don't lend each other a hand,
who will?

129
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
I understand
that, right now, you're mad at me.

130
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
I just wanted to say
I'm here for you if you need it,

131
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,040
if you want.

132
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,920
Nobody forced anyone.

133
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,600
You don't need my forgiveness.

134
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,480
Yeah, but I'm just...

135
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,280
I'm sorry about what I said
and how I told you,

136
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,640
so forgive me for that.

137
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,520
Okay.

138
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,240
If you need me to forgive you
for something, then sure, I forgive you.

139
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,880
Cool.

140
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Uh, thanks.

141
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Ander...

142
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,160
just a reminder, you spent a whole year
tied to a machine, doing chemo.

143
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,000
No one should make you feel
like you have to beg or feel guilty

144
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,800
or ask permission.

145
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,560
OMAR, I NEED TO SEE YOU.

146
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,000
What's the matter now?

147
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,440
Without you,
I wouldn't have survived cancer.

148
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,600
What you did was incredible, and, um...

149
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,080
I won't ever forget it, but...

150
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,800
No, don't say it.

151
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,240
Omar...

152
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,040
maybe the cancer took its toll on us.

153
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,360
Please, no.

154
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,560
Not on me, no.

155
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,920
I mean, okay, yes,

156
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,800
I've been in a fucking mental fog,
but I'm not anymore.

157
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,320
When I thought about losing you, I...
Listen, uh...

158
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
I only love <i>you</i>, Ander.

159
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Listen, though.

160
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm not talkin' about Patrick now.

161
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,840
I'm... talking about me.
I thought I'd die, but here I am somehow.

162
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,280
I mean, I just wanna live.

163
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,600
There's a ton of things
I still have to do. A ton.

164
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,640
But... you can do them with me.

165
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,440
It's me, dude.

166
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,320
It's Omar.

167
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,680
It's me.

168
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,440
- I know. I know.
- Omar.

169
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,200
And you have to keep being Omar.

170
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,960
But that's why I'm thinking
it's best we end this here

171
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,440
because I don't want this
to become something else entirely.

172
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,640
Thank you.

173
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,080
Thank you, Omar.
From the bottom of my heart.

174
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,240
And I'm sorry too. I really am.

175
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,480
I was thinkin'
of taking you out to dinner tonight,

176
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,720
so you can clear your head a bit.

177
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,600
You sidetracked me last weekend already.

178
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,640
Rather be at the library
with him on Saturday?

179
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,680
Come to dinner at my place.

180
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,200
We can hang out together a while.

181
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,680
With your dad?

182
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,040
Not what I had in mind, to be honest.

183
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,840
Yeah, but after that,
everything goes smoothly.

184
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,000
Hmm.

185
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,320
Ari, García's gonna be coming over.

186
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,000
That way,
I can go over both of your arguments.

187
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
- How's it goin'?
- All good, thanks.

188
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm goin' to your place for dinner.

189
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,280
SHARE MY LOCATION

190
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,040
DID YOU BLOCK ME?

191
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
What's the matter?

192
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Armando.

193
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Wait, what?

194
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,680
What the fuck does that asshole want?
We're calling the police now.

195
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Hey, hold up.
Want my family knowing about it?

196
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,360
Oh, so you care about your family now?

197
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,040
I mean, yeah,
my family and the entire school

198
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,520
and kinda the whole world.

199
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,920
Just relax, okay?

200
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's all good.

201
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,200
I can handle this guy.

202
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,880
Do you know that, until the age of three,
all I ate was chocolate?

203
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Oh really?

204
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,640
Psst, hey!

205
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,160
Some dumbass guy sure as hell
isn't gonna spoil our...

206
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,040
...chocolate party.

207
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
No, Mencía, I said...

208
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,440
Sorry, I couldn't resist.
You know I just can't help myself.

209
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,680
Mencía.

- Samuel?

226
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,000
No, I don't want any, thanks.
Gotta stay sharp for tomorrow's debate.

227
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,320
Hmm.

228
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,400
The winner's going
to the European debate competition,

229
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,360
where they'll have to present
but have to do it in French, right?

230
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,640
Hmm. Well, yes.

231
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
What would you do?

232
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,080
Don't you speak French?

233
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,280
I have a decent grasp of it.

234
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,880
Yeah, for a local yokel, maybe.

235
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,320
What?

236
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,880
But don't worry.

237
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,400
Because since Ari's gonna win,
that won't be a problem, right?

238
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,840
You know, you should thank him, Samuel.

239
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
Why?

240
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,880
Because people like us rise
to the challenge when we're questioned.

241
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,440
I'm sorry. People like <i>you</i>?

242
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Yeah, people who studied on scholarship.

243
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,840
Ah, right.

244
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
And haven't been as fortunate
as the three of you here.

245
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,960
<i>I'm </i>the one who's competing with Samuel,
Guzmán, not you.

246
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,440
- Me?
- Yeah.

247
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,760
I wasn't. I'm not worried.

248
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,800
I don't see you spending Christmas
with his family

249
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,360
in some shithole in Morocco.

250
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,760
- What?
- Yeah.

251
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,280
His brother ran off there.
His mom went as well.

252
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,720
I was told he'd been exonerated, though.

253
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,280
More like he didn't wait
to get the verdict.

254
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,360
So you're saying his brother
fled the country while on probation?

255
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,760
Just so you know
the gem of a brother-in-law you'd have.

256
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,560
See you tomorrow.

257
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
Mencía!

258
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,456
- What are you doing here?
- I'm trying to have a conversation.

259
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,400
- You're following me.
- I saw your Instagram.

260
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,880
Mencía, please.

261
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,600
I just wanted to apologize.

262
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
What for?

263
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,280
I found out what happened... and I'm sorry.

264
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,920
Son of a bitch is done.

265
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,360
He can forget about his career
and basically everything.

266
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,160
Can I drive you home?

267
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
I gave it up.

268
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,000
Maybe you should get a new cell phone.

269
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,280
- Why?
- Doesn't that guy have your number?

270
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, but I mean, I blocked him, so...

271
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,080
Yeah, but he might give it
to someone else, harass you, whatever.

272
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,200
Right. I hadn't thought of that.

273
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Well, thanks.

274
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,120
Where are we?

275
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,440
It'd be nice for us to have a drink
before heading home.

276
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,720
No, uh, I don't think my girlfriend
would think that's a very good idea.

277
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,080
I'm sorry.

278
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,360
All right, but at least
let me take you home... Mencía.

279
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,080
Mencía, please.

280
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,200
Mencía.

281
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,800
I'll take you home. I will.

282
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Hey.

283
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,520
I'm here to get all my stuff.

284
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,400
Right. Yeah, Omar let me know.

285
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,120
Do you want me to help you out?

286
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,000
No, I can do it alone.

287
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Okay.

288
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,960
<i>Wanna check to see
if everything's there? Nothing's missing?</i>

289
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
You okay?

290
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,600
It's just that...
No, no, this can't be real.

291
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,560
I mean, okay,
yeah, it's true I had doubts about it,

292
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,800
but I don't anymore.
I know what I want now.

293
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
I can't believe this hurts so much.

294
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,800
And if it hurts this much,
it's because I really love him, isn't it?

295
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,120
This is the worst part.

296
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,280
I can't breathe.

297
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,560
<i>You think that knot
in your stomach will never go away.</i>

298
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,920
<i>But one day,
the knot starts to loosen up,</i>

299
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,560
<i>and it hurts less and less...
until you suddenly realize that...</i>

300
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,880
<i>...you haven't thought about him all day.</i>

301
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,360
<i>You can't even remember
why it once hurt so much.</i>

302
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,320
But there's no way I can forget him.

303
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,400
I can't, and I don't want to.

304
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
Shit, I mean, it's Ander.

305
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,040
It's Ander.

306
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Oh yeah. He came looking for me.

307
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,936
Why the fuck did you tell me you quit
and then lie to me?

308
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,760
- He came to apologize to me.
- Yeah.

309
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,520
Look, this video shows <i>your mother's </i>POV.

310
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,400
But what do <i>you </i>see?

311
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,400
'Cause it seems like you only see
what you wanna see.

312
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,760
Haven't you asked yourself
why your mother knows this guy?

313
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,360
Why he might've been
at the door of her place? No.

314
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,640
Because all you see is I'm lying to you.

315
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,200
What the fuck are you tryin' to say
about my mother?

316
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,920
Your mother saw us together
for the first time

317
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,960
when the two of us went to her spot.

318
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,520
We went there to have a drink and, um...

319
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,840
also, so your mom could...
sell him some coke.

320
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,960
No.
No, no way. That's impossible.

321
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,840
- My mother quit that for me.
- No, Rebe. <i>I </i>quit that shit for you.

322
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,840
<i>I </i>quit for you,
and you still trust your mother,

323
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,280
who, ironically,
is the only one here who's lying.

324
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Patrick.

325
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Yeah?

326
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,800
Uh...

327
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,840
why don't we skip classes today
and go out somewhere?

328
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,000
How come?

329
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,320
Don't know. I wanna treat myself.

330
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,000
Plus, they're having
that freakin' debate thing.

331
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,480
They won't notice we're gone.

332
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,200
Okay.
What sort of <i>plan </i>do you have in mind?

333
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,080
Hmm.

334
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,720
Was hoping you'd come up with it.

335
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,960
- Mencía, have you seen Ander?
- Sorry.

336
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,440
- Have you seen Rebe?
- No.

337
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,440
<i>FYI, I'm ditching class.</i>

338
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,240
<i>I'm throwing a thing at the house,
so cover for me. Pretty please?</i>

339
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,520
Fine. I'll text when the debate's over.

340
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,480
Listen, don't trash the house, all right?
Don't wanna invoke the wrath of Benjamín.

341
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,720
Okay, love you.

342
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
DEBATE DAYS

343
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Hey.

344
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,560
The dress code is topless.

345
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
That's the spirit.

346
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,760
Hey, what's goin' on?

347
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,840
Yeah, good stuff.

348
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,000
Hey. Where's the bathroom?

349
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,640
Well said, Samuel. Thank you.

350
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,840
Ariadna, when you're ready.

351
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,240
Thank you kindly.

352
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,360
Reentry depends
on the prisoner's willpower,

353
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,600
not on institutions.

354
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,120
Some may say, after jail,
they have been conditioned

355
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,680
to relapse into criminal behavior.

356
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,480
But maybe change isn't what they want,
or change isn't possible.

357
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,120
Recidivism rates speak for themselves,
not to mention concrete examples.

358
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,560
On this matter, I'm sure my opponent
is intimately familiar

359
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,640
with the case of a man accused of murder
only two years ago.

360
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,360
And the accused
spent several long weeks in jail,

361
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,520
then decided to flee while on probation,

362
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,560
thus breaking the law
and adding to his previous offenses.

363
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,560
My opponent is familiar with this case...

364
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,800
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

365
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,560
...because that man is his brother.

366
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,400
- Why did she say that?
- Why'd you use that?

367
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,760
It's best to put a name to the data.
Simple as that.

368
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,200
Mentioning my brother
is completely inappropriate.

369
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
His case is well known
to everyone at the school.

370
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,440
I don't think
I'm revealing any state secrets here.

371
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,560
I'm sorry, Samuel,
but I think Ariadna's right.

372
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,136
Samuel's brother...

373
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,560
- Samuel. Samuel!
- He'll come back.

374
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,200
- What's with the childish tantrum?
- Maybe we're not that similar.

375
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,960
- I'm over being questioned every day!
- This is how you live your life?

376
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,200
You wallow in misfortune
and use it as an excuse

377
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,200
to stay stuck in the exact same place.

378
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,600
Don't give me another Jedi master speech,
'cause I'm over it.

379
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,640
No, you wanna hear from the Jedi master?
You're gonna love this one.

380
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,520
Know why I have so much respect
for the art of debate?

381
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,520
<i>Because like all other arts,
it represents life itself.</i>

382
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,760
<i>And you can load up on arguments
and reasons.</i>

383
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,960
<i>You can...</i>

384
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,800
<i>...prepare to the point of exhaustion.</i>

385
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,000
<i>You can feel superior and indestructible.</i>

386
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,200
<i>But without fail,</i>

387
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,800
<i>something unexpected comes up
without warning</i>

388
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
<i>and can shatter your protective armor.</i>

389
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,520
<i>Without fail.</i>

390
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,640
<i>And that...
is when you discover how weak you are.</i>

391
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,880
<i>When you realize everything
you thought about yourself,</i>

392
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,040
<i>that everything you had prepared...</i>

393
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,120
<i>is absolutely useless.</i>

394
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,160
- I was looking for you.
- Oh, hi.

395
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,480
Uh, wanna come sleep over
at my place tonight?

396
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Um...

397
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,520
Sure. Yeah, okay.

398
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,160
So you can... either run away,
playing the victim

399
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,960
and hiding behind a series of excuses
that aren't even yours,

400
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,080
like that thing with your brother...
or you can choose to rise up

401
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,400
and fight to bring out
what you would like to become.

402
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,760
Let me know what you decide.

403
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,640
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

404
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,840
And then poor Samuel just walks out,
right in the middle of the debate.

405
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,720
Ari didn't know what to do.

406
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,600
- She was stunned.
- Hmm.

407
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,560
Um, any chance you're hungry?

408
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,256
- Yeah, a little, yeah.
- Yeah?

409
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,560
I'll see if they can make something.
We can have it here.

410
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,840
- Okay? Okay.
- Okay.

411
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,080
Oh, I have to grab my cell pho...

412
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,880
What are you doing?

413
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,600
Nothing.
I just wanted to put on some music.

414
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,720
I thought we would trust each other.

415
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,640
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry. I don't know.

416
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,960
Ari's been doing a number on me all day,
and I just...

417
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,680
Yeah, but Ari has no idea
where I was on Friday.

418
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,800
- I know.
<i>- You </i>do 'cause I was with you.

419
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,560
- Wasn't I? Don't you get it?
- It's just... Please, I'm sorry.

420
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,440
You have so little self-esteem

421
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,360
that you can't understand
how someone like me would be with you.

422
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,120
And you look for any excuse
to ruin a good thing... all the time.

423
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,320
Will you always remind me of my station?

424
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,120
Looking for flaws
under some kind of microscope.

425
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,800
Closer and closer each time
till you no longer see me.

426
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,360
- You're wrong. I do see you.
- No.

427
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,040
Okay? I see you, and I like you.
I like you so much it hurts me.

428
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,440
I... I'm not like those girls from before.

429
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,360
I'll go tell the driver
to come pick you up.

430
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,040
If you want, you can check
that I deleted your video.

431
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,240
Snoop around as much as you like.

432
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,440
Honey? Can you not hear me?
I've been hollering at you forever now.

433
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,200
- Are you alone?
- Oh shit.

434
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,720
The house stinks of testosterone.

435
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,960
- Does it really?
- No.

436
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Thank you.

437
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,440
What's this?

438
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,320
Don't know.
It came while we were partying.

439
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,320
A NEW NUMBER SO YOU CAN START
FROM SCRATCH. BIG KISS, ARMANDO.

440
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,360
I RAN AWAY FROM HOME.

441
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,160
I didn't tell you about Nano
so you'd use it against him.

442
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,000
And, Ari,
that whole winning-at-any-cost thing?

443
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,200
- It wasn't cool.
- <i>Well, you're the one to talk.</i>

444
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,000
<i>I'm not the only one who's obsessed
with competing with Samuel.</i>

445
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,640
<i>No one would ever guess you're friends.</i>

446
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,400
Well, we are. Seriously.

447
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,600
Samuel's a cool guy.

448
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,240
He's the best thing I've gotten
out of these past two shitty years.

449
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,000
And it's true that when he got here,
yeah, I looked down on him.

450
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,840
<i>But look,
the guy had everything against him,</i>

451
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,560
<i>and he's beaten the odds every time.</i>

452
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,440
But be real.
You still look down on him a little.

453
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,320
<i>Not anymore, honestly.</i>

454
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,480
<i>In fact,
that's why he makes me so jealous.</i>

455
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,240
<i>And maybe, well,
he makes me scared I might lose you.</i>

456
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,280
<i>You're scared of losing me?</i>

457
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,120
I mean, okay,
not like <i>scared </i>scared or terrified.

458
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,120
A little scared.

459
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
<i>What?</i>

460
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,920
What?

461
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,680
<i>Do you like that I'm scared of losing you?</i>

462
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,200
I like that you're not afraid to say that.

463
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,720
<i>I don't know
what came over me or what I was thinking.</i>

464
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,720
<i>I'll meet you in half an hour
at the pier on the lake.</i>

465
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,720
<i>Please come and hear me out.</i>
