1
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that!</font>

2
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

3
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sir! Sir! Come back!</font>

4
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've gotta get outta here.</font>

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boo, boo, boo, hey, hey, hey.</font>

6
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Girl, you got that
list of questions?</font>

7
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

8
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I have
everything that I need.</font>

9
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be happy you ain't got
this chlamydia, all right?</font>

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, girl, I tried
to take a piss earlier,</font>

11
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was like there was an angry
dragon inside my snatch,</font>

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know, like some
Game of Thrones shit!</font>

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's terrible, Kateesha.</font>

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help it when
a tall, athletic brother</font>

15
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">come pushing up
on this thickness.</font>

16
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, yeah...
Oh, shit!</font>

17
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, girl, I thank God
every motherfucking day</font>

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the SuperSonics
moved to Oklahoma. Shit.</font>

19
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm gonna go so I won't
be late for your interview.</font>

20
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck are
you wearing, girl?</font>

21
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There ain't no camouflage, no
fishnets and no fluorescent colors.</font>

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How they gonna see you in the dark, bitch?
How they gonna see you?</font>

23
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta go.</font>

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, so big.</font>

25
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

26
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're looking for the homeless
shelter, it's two doors down.</font>

27
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, I'm...
I'm Hannah Steale.</font>

28
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to see Mr. Black.</font>

29
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The college bitch.
May I take your coat?</font>

30
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, please.
Thank you.</font>

31
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ew...</font>

32
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In case you're wondering,</font>

34
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the hot secretary
who's fucking the boss,</font>

35
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which means there's no
room for the dopey intern</font>

36
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the damaged
hair and the cankles.</font>

37
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

38
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh!</font>

39
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the smell of his balls</font>

40
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after lunch and two
games of racquetball.</font>

41
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm...</font>

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a nice day,
Ms. Steale.</font>

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plain-ass bitch.</font>

44
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! My neck.
Ow. Ooh.</font>

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You...</font>

46
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

47
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I should've
tried pulling.</font>

48
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Kavahellnah.</font>

49
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian Black.</font>

50
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

51
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think so, yeah.</font>

52
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, 'cause you got fucked up!</font>

53
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you hit that statue
like a hard-charging rhino,</font>

54
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I say rhino because you're
a lot fatter than I thought,</font>

55
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you got this
bump on your nose</font>

56
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that resembles a small horn.
Um...</font>

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you wanna get that squeezed.
Okay.</font>

58
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little Proactiv on it.</font>

59
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not
Ms. Kavahellnah.</font>

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ain't
Ms. Kavahellnah?</font>

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck are you?
My name is Hannah Steale.</font>

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm studying literature</font>

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with Kateesha at the university.</font>

64
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

65
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, have a seat.</font>

66
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
You're welcome.</font>

67
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

68
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. So, what do you want?</font>

69
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ!
Just spit it out!</font>

70
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A pencil.</font>

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A pencil... You
should've just said that in the beginning!</font>

72
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gosh! Here, take 'em!</font>

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus!
Thank you.</font>

74
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta get your shit together, Ms.
Steale.</font>

75
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

76
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are Kateesha's
questions, okay?</font>

77
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You have mad stacks of cash."</font>

78
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"How'd you get it,
and can I get some?"</font>

79
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...
Ms. Steale.</font>

80
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I</i> got my money</font>

81
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the way most black
entrepreneurs got theirs.</font>

82
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Real estate?
Drug dealing.</font>

83
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, you have to know your
business inside and out.</font>

84
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I smoked crack.
Not for long,</font>

85
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but just long enough to know
what a penis tastes like.</font>

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tastes like raw rump roast.</font>

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.
Ew!</font>

88
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got all ashy, like E.T. when
he was sick in the river.</font>

89
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lost six essential teeth.</font>

90
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever tried to eat
steak with one molar?</font>

91
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Why would
I do that?</font>

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gnaw and suck.</font>

93
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gnaw and suck.
It's hard.</font>

94
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could be that you're lucky. No.</font>

95
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keanu Reeves is lucky.</font>

96
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flo Rida is lucky.</font>

97
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iggy Azalea is lucky.</font>

98
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he's lucky.</font>

99
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next question.</font>

100
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Is you gay, or is you
gay as a motherfucker?"</font>

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because you touch a penis
doesn't mean you're gay.</font>

102
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially if it's
for money or crack.</font>

103
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're only gay if you
enjoy touching penis.</font>

104
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You touch a penis with attitude, like...
"I don't really like this."</font>

105
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ain't gay.
It's just exploratory.</font>

106
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you're
an English major.</font>

107
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it Chaucer, Shelley or Keats</font>

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that first made you fall
in love with literature?</font>

109
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was Seuss.
Seuss!</font>

110
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cat in the Hat, Thing 1 and Thing 2.
And Thing 2!</font>

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, who doesn't
wanna be them?</font>

112
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know, me and my
brother were Thing 1</font>

113
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Thing 2 for
Halloween this year.</font>

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?
Yeah. Check this out.</font>

115
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, look at both of you!</font>

116
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We called 'em
Thang 1 and Thang 2.</font>

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's amazing.</font>

118
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if I wanted to hire you?</font>

119
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I see the way
the women dress around here.</font>

120
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't exactly fit in.</font>

121
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, despite the
Salvation Army sweater,</font>

122
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the greasy weaves,</font>

123
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your big ol' Usher nose,</font>

124
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's something oddly
attractive about you.</font>

125
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you're like
the little ugly runt</font>

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a litter full
of pretty puppies.</font>

127
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the little ugly one
that nobody wants to touch.</font>

128
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're, all hairless and
big-eyed and wild-looking.</font>

129
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you just wanna take you
home and give you love,</font>

130
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or stuff you in a sack
with a bunch of rocks</font>

131
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and just toss
your little ugly ass</font>

132
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the bottom of the ocean.</font>

133
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just put you out your misery.</font>

134
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Okay.</font>

135
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Mr. Black.</font>

136
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, call me Christian.</font>

137
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian. I hope I answered
all your questions.</font>

138
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You certainly did.</font>

139
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah.
Christian.</font>

140
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, shit!</font>

141
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

142
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

143
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ!</font>

144
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, make it stop!</font>

145
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">White girls,
get that elevator fixed.</font>

146
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, Hannah!</font>

147
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how was he?</font>

148
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was all right, I guess.</font>

149
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit! You fucked him,
girl! I knew that shit!</font>

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, girl, get that
dick, girl, get that dick.</font>

151
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Uh! Get that dick!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!</font>

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it to town, motherfucker.
Get that dick.</font>

153
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</font>

154
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, girl, yeah! Ooh!</font>

155
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, did he have a big dick?</font>

156
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Ooh, girl, was it
like real skinny, girl,</font>

157
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or was it like real long,
like skinny long?</font>

158
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause that's fucking weird.</font>

159
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, like, short
and thick, girl?</font>

160
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can get down with
that short, fat dick.</font>

161
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, there is... There's no...
There's no dick.</font>

162
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember what I told you, okay?</font>

163
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's got like little red zit-like
things on the head of that shit,</font>

164
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you put that in your butt, okay?</font>

165
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He gonna be like, "Oh, girl,
no, it's just skin tags."</font>

166
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Bitch, you got 47
skin tags on your dick?</font>

167
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I ain't falling for that shit.</font>

168
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Again!" Okay?</font>

169
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm, but you gotta admit,
girl, he is bangin'! Mmm!</font>

170
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I guess if you're
into the wildly-successful,</font>

171
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">super-handsome,
possibly-dangerous thing,</font>

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then Christian
Black is your guy.</font>

173
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bitch, I'm talkin'
'bout Lil Weezy!</font>

174
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, girl, he got
tats on his tats.</font>

175
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he ain't afraid
to get a bitch pregnant.</font>

176
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let you keep
the baby and everythin'.</font>

177
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

178
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna eat that?</font>

179
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, I wish I could find a man
the size of this to satisfy me.</font>

180
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This shit
better be gluten-free.</font>

181
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm, Mr. Black.</font>

182
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

183
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm... God, Christian.</font>

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm...</font>

185
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, you know
what I wanna do.</font>

186
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.
What the fuck?</font>

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a pleasant
surprise, Ms. Steale.</font>

188
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, call me Hannah.</font>

189
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Ms. Steale.</font>

190
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just in the area and
wanted to pick up a few items.</font>

191
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you stalking me, Mr. Black?</font>

192
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

193
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, unless you
don't want me to.</font>

194
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do want me to, don't you?</font>

195
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just something to think about.</font>

196
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you with something?</font>

197
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

198
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to pick up some
cable ties and some tape.</font>

199
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you're in luck, we got
some cable ties right here.</font>

200
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What color do you want? Red.</font>

201
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The color of passion.</font>

202
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tape is this way.
Follow me.</font>

203
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I didn't know better,</font>

204
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might mistake you
for a serial killer.</font>

205
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be ridiculous.
If I was a serial killer,</font>

206
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd need rope, ax, lye, ammonia,</font>

207
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">chlorophyll, wood
chipper, plastic sheets</font>

208
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and three large
boxes of space Pampers.</font>

209
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a shovel.</font>

210
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second thought...</font>

211
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I need to
pick up a few more items.</font>

212
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, looks like
you're all set now.</font>

213
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Ms. Steale.</font>

214
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, if your roommate needs a
photo to go with the story,</font>

215
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be around tomorrow.
And the next day.</font>

216
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the day after that.</font>

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm actually around
all of next week.</font>

218
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Just contact me.</font>

219
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Christian Black."</font>

220
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I'm not a bidness man,
I'm a bidness... man."</font>

221
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you so much for your help, Ms.
Steale.</font>

222
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me know when those space
Pampers come in, okay?</font>

223
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save me three boxes!</font>

224
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a long drive ahead of me.</font>

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye!</font>

226
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna call you.</font>

227
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesse!
Hey.</font>

228
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you so much
for doing this last minute.</font>

229
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah, listen, you are
my best friend, okay?</font>

230
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I'd do
anything for you, right?</font>

231
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

232
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I'd really love a
hand job, though. What?</font>

233
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said I really love this job.
It's amazing.</font>

234
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.
Get in here.</font>

235
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Later I wanna hit it.</font>

236
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Um...</font>

237
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't catch the last thing.</font>

238
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said later
I wanna hit the bar.</font>

239
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.
Come on, Hannah,</font>

240
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's what platonic friends do.</font>

241
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know?
You grab a beer, right?</font>

242
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you make out and have sex</font>

243
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until we question the status of our
friendship or whatever, you know?</font>

244
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess. Come on.
Yeah. Come here.</font>

245
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!
Whoa!</font>

246
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah! Did you just
kiss me on my lips?</font>

247
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, I thought that... No. Listen.
Okay, let's get one thing clear.</font>

248
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are just friends. Don't make it weird.
Oh, no, I thought...</font>

249
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, I'll fuck you later.
Wait. What?</font>

250
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said I'll see you later.</font>

251
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez, Hannah.
Oh.</font>

252
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just go.</font>

253
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pow! Pow!</font>

254
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Girl, he's staring at you like
some real.</font>

255
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fear-type
shit right now, girl.</font>

256
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He look like Marky Mark</font>

257
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after he left the Funky Bunch
and started acting, girl.</font>

258
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, give me a smile.</font>

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheese.</font>

260
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, don't ever
fucking smile again, okay?</font>

261
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He asked me to go to coffee
with him after the shoot.</font>

262
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, girl, that's cute!</font>

263
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last time I went to coffee,</font>

264
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got eaten out
outside of McDonald's.</font>

265
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That McCafe menu
got a girl gushin'.</font>

266
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's break the Internet.</font>

267
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat.</font>

268
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not your dog, you
can't tell me what to do.</font>

269
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right. If you were
my dog, I would do this.</font>

270
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad girl! Bad,
bad, bad girl!</font>

271
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, tell me about your family.</font>

272
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

273
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dad left me when
I was 2 years old,</font>

274
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I was mostly
raised by my stepdad, Ron.</font>

275
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's painfully uninteresting.</font>

276
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about your mother?</font>

277
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's been married 8 times.
Yeah.</font>

278
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's an incurable romantic.</font>

279
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you a romantic?</font>

280
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess.</font>

281
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I like long
walks on the beach.</font>

282
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like baby talk,
I like to cuddle.</font>

283
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, and I love
Nicholas Sparks movies.</font>

284
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even the one with Miley Cyrus?</font>

285
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my favorite one!
Bitch, I'm out!</font>

286
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheers.
Yeah.</font>

287
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, that tastes like a
white boy on spring break.</font>

288
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate him.

289
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want another drink?</font>

290
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Drink to forget.</font>

291
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

292
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,325

<font face="Comic Sans MS">That tastes horrible.</font>

294
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Molly must not be
crushed up all the way.</font>

295
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me fix it for you.</font>

296
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,125

298
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta go to the ladies' room.</font>

299
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? I have to take a shit!</font>

300
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah....Hannah, you feeling all right?
A little woozy perhaps?</font>

301
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Huh? Unable to
make good decisions?</font>

302
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should take it
to the next level</font>

303
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you, like, suck my dick.

00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, you take it
to the next level,</font>

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you stop feelin' sick, okay?</font>

306
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. You are
my bestest friend.</font>

307
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. With benefits.</font>

308
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah... Fuck my mouth
with your fingers.</font>

309
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

310
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm never gonna get none.</font>

311
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll fuck you. I ain't gonna
like it, but I'll do it.</font>

312
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I don't
fuck white girls, okay?</font>

313
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nigga, who you callin' white?</font>

314
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She just call me the N word?</font>

315
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of turned me on.</font>

316
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call me "nigga" again.</font>

317
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

318
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, hello there.</font>

319
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,882

320
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah, are you wasted?</font>

321
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yes, I am wasted.</i></font>

326
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. "Oh,

327
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"No, stay away

328
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me put this in words
you can understand.</font>

329

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,043

<font face="Comic Sans MS">because my roommate is in there.</font>

369
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. She's being
well taken care of.</font>

370
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name again?</font>

374
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh... Mmm...</font>

375
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The poor one.</font>

376
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-mmm...</font>

377
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're saying,</font>

378
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Oh, he's financially poor,
yet spiritually rich."</font>

379
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm...</font>

380
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah, that don't count.
What do you feel?</font>

381
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you feel?
Oh, my God.</font>

382
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When does that end?
Oh, my God!</font>

383
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The weight of my penis makes my
money too heavy to carry around!</font>

384
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

385
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you later, woman.</font>

386
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until we meet again.
How can I touch you?</font>

387
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, get in touch with you!</font>

388
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,931

<font face="Comic Sans MS">is seven.</font>

390
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

391
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a good number.
Oh, God.</font>

392
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'mma call you!</font>

393
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>

394
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been staring
at you all night.</font>

395
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't blinked once.</font>

396
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gosh, my eyes are hurting.</font>

397
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did I get here? I
brought you here, Hannah.</font>

398
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you undress me?</font>

399
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sure did. Mmm...</font>

400
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God, we didn't...</font>

401
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we didn't.</font>

402
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have the blue
balls to prove it.</font>

403
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at these things.</font>

404
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh!</font>

405
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are those?
What the fuck are those?</font>

406
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh... It hurts so much.</font>

407
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what to do!</font>

408
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you showing me this?</font>

409
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ordered you some breakfast.</font>

410
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Eat. You'll
need your strength.</font>

411
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you licked this one, and did all
sorts of other weird stuff to it.</font>

412
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get a fresh one?
Maybe some jam.</font>

413
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, eat it.</font>

414
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you just
leave me alone, Christian?</font>

415
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'm incapable
of leaving you alone.</font>

416
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a certified stalker.</font>

417
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have four restraining orders,</font>

418
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm currently
working on a fifth.</font>

419
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me.</font>

420
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't do the romance thing.</font>

421
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anal, yes.
Fisting, sure.</font>

422
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two in the pink,
one in the stink, yeah.</font>

423
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do that.
But I don't do romance.</font>

424
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I'd like
to bite that lip.</font>

425
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you would.</font>

426
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

427
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! Mmm...</font>

428
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

429
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's get
you outta here.</font>

430
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, that made me wet. Oh!</font>

431
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, love it.</font>

432
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck the bullshit.</font>

433
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doin'?</font>

434
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open your eyes.
Lizard kisses, come on.</font>

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vampire bite!</font>

436
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love it! More!</font>

437
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,120

439
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shut up and watch.</font>

440
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get outta here!</font>

441
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

442
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to warn you,
elevators make me horny.</font>

443
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, Daddy, I want you to
write a song about me.</font>

444
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna be your muse.</font>

445
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, this is a great time.</font>

446
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm inspired to write a song</font>

447
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about you right now.</font>

448
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, that feels so good.</font>

449
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>'Cause I love
havin' sex unprotected.</i></font>

450
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh.</font>

451
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I love when my
dick's in you naked.</i></font>

452
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deeper, Daddy,

453
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Goin' raw in you, you, you...</i></font>

454
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Yes!</font>

455
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Goin' raw in you, you, you, you.</i></font>

456
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, I think you going platinum
in about two minutes! Oh!</font>

457
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You're infected, yeah.</i></font>

458
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,365

459
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>'Cause, girl, you burned it.</i></font>

460
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, that like an E
minor or something?</font>

461
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, you burned it!</i></font>

462
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, you burned.</i></font>

463
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ah... You...</i></font>

464
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, shit.</font>

465
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucker!</font>

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You done?
I gotta get to church.</font>

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!
Oh.</font>

468
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two are fucking.</font>

469
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh.
Hey, bro.</font>

470
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doin'?
My brother.</font>

471
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My brother, peace and blessings.</font>

472
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah, this is my
little brother, Eli.</font>

473
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Little?
- Yes.</font>

474
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Eli, like the
movie about the book,</font>

475
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I'm deep.</font>

476
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is deep.</font>

477
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Balls deep.</font>

478
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

479
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kateesha told me
a lot about you.</font>

480
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you're like...
You're, like, a lot</font>

481
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">plainer than
I thought you would be.</font>

482
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she plain but pretty.</font>

483
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're like a brick wall, just boring and rigid...
- Okay.</font>

484
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And 'gust ashy 'm some phases.</i></font>

485
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, okay, okay,
enough with the small talk.</font>

486
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a long
drive ahead of us.</font>

487
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do. Great pleasure.
It's been a pleasure.</font>

488
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The moon shall rise again.</font>

489
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, that so romantic, boo.
What that mean?</font>

490
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deuces, bitch. Okay, I got you!
I see you later!</font>

491
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice meeting you.
Bye.</font>

492
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, so listen.
Meet me at the office later.</font>

493
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have something
special planned for you.</font>

494
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Deuces, bitch.
Mmm-hmm.</font>

495
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who you calling a bitch?
Oh, shit!</font>

496
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, girl.</font>

497
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just saying.
He said it to her,</font>

498
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I thought it was cute.</font>

499
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

500
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, bitch...
I mean, girl.</font>

501
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready for
the ride of your life?</font>

502
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Are we gonna
go in your helicopter?</font>

503
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe you thought I was
gonna take you on the chopper.</font>

504
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We haven't even fucked yet.</font>

505
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After you.</font>

506
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit!
You live here?</font>

507
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, a black man can't have
a nice place like this?</font>

508
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, a black man cannot have a
beautiful place like this.</font>

509
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Wesley Snipes
had a place like this,</font>

510
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before he stopped
doing his own taxes.</font>

511
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about some wine?</font>

512
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, please.</font>

513
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

514
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know why I brought
you here, Hannah?</font>

515
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm assuming to make sweet love.</font>

516
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't make love.
I fuck.</font>

517
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard and quick.</font>

518
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really quick.</font>

519
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a Ronda Rousey fight.
You blink and it's over.</font>

520
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

521
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But first you're
gonna have to sign</font>

522
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a nondisclosure agreement.</font>

523
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

524
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's basically lawyer talk
for "shut the fuck up."</font>

525
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me.
I'll explain.</font>

526
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A nondisclosure agreement</font>

527
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">protects both you and me,
but mostly me.</font>

528
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Behind this door is my playroom.</font>

529
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean, like, for your
PlayStation and stuff?</font>

530
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh. That's a nice key.</font>

531
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So tight.</font>

532
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keyhole don't wanna open!
You ready to get opened?</font>

533
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reload, man! Reload!
I told you to reload!</font>

534
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an Xbox man myself.</font>

535
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you next, Black!</font>

536
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want none of this.</font>

537
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, when you done with
Wendy Williams over there,</font>

538
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">jump on this game so I can
shoot you in the face!</font>

539
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna be honest with you, Christian.
She's not attractive.</font>

540
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, the bitch look
like she got lupus.</font>

541
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you look like a thumb</font>

542
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's been yanked out
of somebody's asshole.</font>

543
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On!</font>

544
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slam dunk!</font>

545
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's crazy.
That's crazy.</font>

546
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
how about... Ha!</font>

547
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got nothing. 'Cause
I'm better than you.</font>

548
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, I got something</font>

549
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really wanna show you.</font>

550
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. It's not more
broke niggas, is it?</font>

551
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more broke niggas.
No offense.</font>

552
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't worry about those
ingrown hairs on your penis.</font>

553
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't see them through your pants.</font>

554
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't give her
all the dick, bro.</font>

555
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She don't deserve it.
Half the dick.</font>

556
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there fucking
Charles Barkley.</font>

557
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck this shit!
I'm out!</font>

558
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Ms. Steale.
Just keep an open mind.</font>

559
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tantalizing.</font>

560
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got these from my grandma.</font>

561
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a sick motherfucker.</font>

562
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Bill Cosby's
a sick motherfucker.</font>

563
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just a dominant.</font>

564
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that
have to do with me?</font>

565
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to give
yourself to me sexually.</font>

566
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hence all the whips, chains
and freaky sex toys.</font>

567
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what would I get out of it?</font>

568
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

569
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

570
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh. Let me get this straight.
Mmm-hmm.</font>

571
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you wanna beat me
with these paddles...</font>

572
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whip.
Whips.</font>

573
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna chain
me to this rack...</font>

574
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eh... Handcuff.</font>

575
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And humiliate me in
unimaginable ways,</font>

576
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in exchange
for all this torture,</font>

577
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get you?</font>

578
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's correct.</font>

579
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And women go for this?</font>

580
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some women.</font>

581
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. It's like Disneyland
for grown-ups. Yeah.</font>

582
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do you think?</font>

583
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pretty much
cool with anything,</font>

584
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as long as you promise you won't
tell my dad I fucked a black guy.</font>

585
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do you think?</font>

586
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two things.
Where's the cup,</font>

587
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and when do we eat shit?</font>

588
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we supposed to do in here?</font>

589
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I thought we'd start with
a little bit of rope play.</font>

590
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

591
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, how about
I just mount you</font>

592
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to that rack over
there and spank you?</font>

593
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell to the no!</font>

594
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps a little
bit of flogging?</font>

595
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know what
the hell flogging means,</font>

596
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so fuck to the no!</font>

597
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, what are
we supposed to do then?</font>

598
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to find Jesus!
That's what you can do.</font>

599
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, here's how it goes.</font>

600
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've drafted a standard contract
that lays out the terms.</font>

601
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lots of sex, we have more sex.</font>

602
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yadda-yadda,
we end with sex.</font>

603
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look it over, and you negotiate
what you're willing to do.</font>

604
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate to throw a monkey wrench</font>

605
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into the whole works here,</font>

606
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I...</font>

607
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have
low self-esteem?</font>

608
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I...</font>

609
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have daddy issues.</font>

610
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

611
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm trying to
tell you is, I'm a...</font>

612
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A virgin?
Yeah.</font>

613
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man! I can't believe this!</font>

614
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand!</font>

615
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, tell me
you've done something.</font>

616
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blowjob?</font>

617
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where does the blowing come in?
Finger pop?</font>

618
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.
Angry panda?</font>

619
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it angry?
Why did you ask that?</font>

620
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Okay,
tell me you've done anal.</font>

621
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how it goes.</font>

622
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You let guys put it in your
little rusty bullet hole</font>

623
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you can tell your
mama and your pastor</font>

624
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you're still a virgin.</font>

625
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've just been waiting.</font>

626
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?</font>

627
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Girl, you are
20-something years old!</font>

628
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It don't get no better.
It's going to spoil!</font>

629
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fermenting down there.
Just fermenting. Okay?</font>

630
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna tell me
nobody wanted the pussy?</font>

631
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I just am very selective
about who I've wanted to...</font>

632
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, selective?</font>

633
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that sound like
something somebody</font>

634
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a pussy that
nobody wanted would say.</font>

635
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.
Don't get me wrong.</font>

636
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want it all worn out
like an old washing machine belt</font>

637
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or hanging like
wet straps in a car wash</font>

638
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or flapping around like an inflatable
figure outside of a mattress store.</font>

639
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I want it to
have some experience.</font>

640
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, look.</font>

641
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna fix this
situation. Right now.</font>

642
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been waiting my
whole life for this.</font>

643
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

644
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

645
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh... Very...</font>

646
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very Sasquatch of you.</font>

647
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you never had sex
with a virgin before?</font>

648
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a hairy one.</font>

649
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! You nicked me!</font>

650
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh...</font>

651
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

652
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, I have an outie.</font>

653
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Wow!</font>

654
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

655
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That got flavor!</font>

656
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You're the first
person who's seen it.</font>

657
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little Eskimo kisses?</font>

658
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, I never had anyone
do that to it before.</font>

659
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! Watch the teeth!
Sorry.</font>

660
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got him.</font>

661
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

662
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. I didn't have
time to shower.</font>

663
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

664
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

665
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

666
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. You ready?</font>

667
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take you
to a whole 'nother galaxy!</font>

668
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, I'm coming!</font>

669
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

670
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God! God! God! God!</font>

671
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!
Already?</font>

672
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that was amazing.</font>

673
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? I guess I was
expecting something</font>

674
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">different.</font>

675
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about it. It's your first time.
Don't sweat it.</font>

676
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll get better with experience.
Just keep working on it.</font>

677
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know, it's
customary for a woman</font>

678
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make a man
an oversized sandwich</font>

679
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to help him regain his strength.</font>

680
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Either that or some leftover
pizza, or maybe a Hot Pocket.</font>

681
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to make you
a Hot Pocket now?</font>

682
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't make the rules,
I'm just telling you.</font>

683
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a lot to learn, kid.</font>

684
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm...</font>

685
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you asleep already?</font>

686
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nigga!</font>

687
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh!</font>

688
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian?</font>

689
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian!
Oh, shit!</font>

690
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck is that?</font>

691
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother.</font>

692
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On!</font>

693
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

694
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I gotta get rid of
two crazy bitches. Fuck.</font>

695
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother!</font>

696
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, Christian.
Hello.</font>

697
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you better get dressed, or we're
gonna be late for the regatta.</font>

698
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot that was today.</font>

699
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not doing
crack again, are you?</font>

700
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Mother. I never
raised you that way.</font>

701
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, it is a prominent trait
in your genealogical pool.</font>

702
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

703
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm standing my ground!
I'm standing my ground!</font>

704
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

705
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother, what're you doing?
That's Hannah Steale!</font>

706
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many times I gotta tell you?
Black lives matter.</font>

707
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's get you up.</font>

708
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah, this is my mother, Claire.
Oh.</font>

709
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry, Hannah.</font>

710
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my, you have
beautiful breasts.</font>

711
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would've thought
they'd be more droopy,</font>

712
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like a sock with
a rock in the toe,</font>

713
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>like in those National
Geographic magazines.</i></font>

714
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have to forgive
my mother's behavior.</font>

715
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes she can be factually
inaccurate and quite racist.</font>

716
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not apologize
for me, Christian.</font>

717
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am your mother, and I love you</font>

718
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like you were my
own white child.</font>

719
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I still hide my wallet
at night, just in case.</font>

720
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you should, Mother.</font>

721
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is awesome to meet you.</font>

722
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you two dating? Oh, no,
Mother, we're not dating.</font>

723
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're just fucking. Hard.</font>

724
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And quick. Apparently,
it's the best way.</font>

725
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I just can't tell you how
pleased lam to meet you, Hannah.</font>

726
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you're the first woman
I've seen Christian with.</font>

727
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assumed that he was...</font>

728
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would Oprah say?
"On the DL?"</font>

729
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian, you can
do so much better.</font>

730
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Mother.</font>

731
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're one of the richest, most
handsome men in the world.</font>

732
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could date white women.</font>

733
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Tiger Woods and Seal.</font>

734
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it's time for
you to go, Mother.</font>

735
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or like Taye Diggs or Quincy Jones.
Or even Ice-T.</font>

736
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah, Christian's Chinese
sister, Mai, has come to town,</font>

737
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we're gonna hide the cats</font>

738
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and have the family
over for dinner.</font>

739
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should come.
I'd be delighted.</font>

740
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was really nice to meet you.</font>

741
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, great.
Time to go, Mom.</font>

742
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

743
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, where is my wallet?</font>

744
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still there.</font>

745
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just never know.
Yeah.</font>

746
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm...</font>

747
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're delicious. Mmm.</font>

748
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

749
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had breakfast.
Time to go.</font>

750
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, look,
your Uber's here. All right.</font>

751
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, what?</font>

752
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spit it out.</font>

753
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, how did you
get into this whole</font>

754
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dominant-submissive thing?</font>

755
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was one of my mother's
really close friends,</font>

756
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my music teacher.</font>

757
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was 16.</font>

758
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was older.</font>

759
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look
so nervous, Christian.</font>

760
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I ask is that
you do your very best.</font>

761
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I thought</i> I <i>was supposed to
be</i> here <i>for</i> music <i>lessons.</i></font>

762
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, you are.</font>

763
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your lesson
starts right here.</font>

764
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey. Ooh. Snap.</font>

765
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a regular
John Holmes here,</font>

766
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without the big
dick and the stamina!</font>

767
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! Again!
1, 2, 3!</font>

768
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

769
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know why
I hit you in the head</font>

770
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with that tambourine, Black?</font>

771
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea.</font>

772
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, were you rushing
or were you dragging?</font>

773
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I thought
I was fucking.</font>

774
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! That wasn't fucking!</font>

775
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, count off.</font>

776
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1, 2...</font>

777
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was I rushing or was I dragging?</font>

778
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Answer the question!
You were rushing!</font>

779
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that a tear?
Oh! Poor little guy.</font>

780
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you upset?
I'm upset.</font>

781
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You worthless, adopted,
unloved little piece of shit!</font>

782
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weeping and slobbering over my
vagina like a 9-year-old girl!</font>

783
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, for the last
father-fucking time,</font>

784
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">say it louder so I can hear it!
I'm upset!</font>

785
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Black, get off the bed!
You make me sick.</font>

786
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm upset.
Get off the bed!</font>

787
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not ready for this!
I'm ready!</font>

788
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh!</font>

789
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willy? Willy,
you're up next.</font>

790
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Willy?</font>

791
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better get your
shit together, Black!</font>

792
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna amount to
anything, sexually or musically.</font>

793
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you know what the biggest</font>

794
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">disappointment of all is to me?</font>

795
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought all you black men
had rhythm and a big dick!</font>

796
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, was I mistaken!</font>

797
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have rhythm!</font>

798
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all set, Ms. Steale.
Courtesy of Mr. Black.</font>

799
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the heck?</font>

800
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?
Is that a drone?</font>

801
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, just sign here.</font>

802
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much.</font>

803
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, girl, another gift?</font>

804
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, you must be
giving that bomb head!</font>

805
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute, is that a
Retina display MacBook Pro?</font>

806
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bitch, you lickin'
that butthole!</font>

807
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't lick a butthole!</font>

808
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, you lucky, girl.</font>

809
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, I licked 6 buttholes last week!
I got a Dell!</font>

810
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desktop!</font>

811
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't take that
shit anywhere, girl.</font>

812
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, the mail come already?</font>

813
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

814
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a weird sex contract
Christian wants me to sign.</font>

815
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sign that, but then you get
that paper, boo, all right?</font>

816
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bitch gotta get hers. You
keep licking that bootie, okay?</font>

817
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're done?</font>

818
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wha...
Yeah, I read your text.</font>

819
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow face, sparkly diamond, poop?</font>

820
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, what does that even mean?</font>

821
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got me all fucked up
with your emojis, like...</font>

822
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how did you get in here?</font>

823
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it matter?</font>

824
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, actually it does matter,</font>

825
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you don't live here
and you don't have a key.</font>

826
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need a key
to get in a hamper, Hannah.</font>

827
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, now, help me outta here.</font>

828
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lucky I wasn't in
your medicine cabinet,</font>

829
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or your jewelry box.</font>

830
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to hide
in your nightstand,</font>

831
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you had this Gideon Bible
in there and I couldn't fit.</font>

832
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute, did you break
in through that window?</font>

833
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one?</font>

834
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, that could've
been anybody.</font>

835
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The brick on the ground says
"Property of Christian Black."</font>

836
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Christian..."</font>

837
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, it does.</font>

838
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, I mean, that could belong
to any black Christian, right?</font>

839
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, okay, shh...</font>

840
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough with the interrogation.</font>

841
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

842
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not move,</font>

843
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I'll be forced to punish you.</font>

844
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said don't move!</font>

845
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

846
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

847
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That feels weird. What is that?
It's so hairy.</font>

848
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Yes!</font>

849
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait, don't move.
Don't, don't...</font>

850
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, that shit was cold!</font>

851
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready,
Ms. Steale?</font>

852
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Christian.</font>

853
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

854
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You brought a condom, right?</font>

855
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A condom?
Yeah.</font>

856
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh... Okay.
Yeah, of course!</font>

857
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I got a condom.
Hold on one second.</font>

858
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it!</font>

859
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just knowing you care enough
to use protection excites me.</font>

860
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aha! Old trusty dusty!</font>

861
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"March, 1982?"
Aw, hell no.</font>

862
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I got one
right here! Found it!</font>

863
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, let me open it
up so you can hear it.</font>

864
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

865
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just gonna scoot these
little bad boys to the side.</font>

866
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! And then I'm gonna park this
right there.</font>

867
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, it feels so natural.</font>

868
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like you're not
wearing anything at all!</font>

869
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's lambskin foreskin.</font>

870
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Just relax.
What?</font>

871
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not you. Now I'm
talking to myself.</font>

872
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Oh... Ready?</font>

873
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was like two strokes!</font>

874
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This nigga's back
here settin' records!</font>

875
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gonna put me
on a Wheaties box! Oh!</font>

876
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank God you're
wearing a condom.</font>

877
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, 'cause, boy,</font>

878
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we wouldn't want to
get you pregnant, right?</font>

879
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I'm not even taking any
birth control and I'm ovulating.</font>

880
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I tell you that
twins run in my family?</font>

881
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Twins?</font>

882
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My sister had sextuplets.</font>

883
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sextu...</font>

884
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, really? Let me just
get an after-sex mint.</font>

885
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, Hannah, here.</font>

886
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have one of these.
Here you go.</font>

887
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

888
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh! It tastes weird.
All done?</font>

889
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

890
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good girl. Phew!</font>

891
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we begin,
Ms. Steale?</font>

892
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Page one, paragraph one.</font>

893
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This must change!</font>

894
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a typo in the header.</font>

895
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it?</font>

896
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Black, I will end this
negotiation right now!</font>

897
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My apologies.</font>

898
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Page four,
section 13-20.</font>

899
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With regards to anal fisfing..</font>

900
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a problem?
Absolutely not.</font>

901
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And strike out vaginal fisting.</font>

902
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, if you're gonna do anal,</font>

903
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're obviously gonna have vaginal
fisting. I mean, it's a given.</font>

904
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, for sure.
I will put that...</font>

905
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm putting that
in there in bold.</font>

906
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next page, sex toys. "Are they
acceptable to the submissive?"</font>

907
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dildos, I guess.
Butt plugs, fine.</font>

908
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck yeah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...</font>

909
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did this slip
through the cracks?</font>

910
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with the genital clamps?</font>

911
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Ms. Steale, I...</font>

912
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't seem to
find those in my...</font>

913
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you forgot
to put them in there.</font>

914
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rookie move,
Mr. Black.</font>

915
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silly me.</font>

916
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's be clear. I will not
share you with another woman.</font>

917
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I require at least two or three.
Five.</font>

918
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seven.
Seven it is.</font>

919
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna shortchange me, Mr.
Black.</font>

920
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You drive a hard
bargain, Ms. Steale.</font>

921
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. You know, Ms. Steale,</font>

922
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to fuck you into
the middle of next month.</font>

923
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Silly. You couldn't
fuck me</font>

924
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into the middle
of the next minute.</font>

925
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll fuck you into
a different galaxy.</font>

926
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be like, "Oh, shit,
it's cold in Pluto!"</font>

927
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, I'm gonna fuck you
at the Stephen Hawking exhibit.</font>

928
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm gonna ram
your ass so hard</font>

929
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I cause a tear in
the time-space continuum.</font>

930
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll fuck you
through slavery times,</font>

931
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you'll get
your freedom papers.</font>

932
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, I'm gonna
rent me a DeLorean</font>

933
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and fuck you back to the future.</font>

934
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll fuck you into
a whole 'nother planet,</font>

935
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where that insect
is from Men in Black.</font>

936
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be like, "Oh, shit!
How many times you fuck me?"</font>

937
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 million, 746
hundred million times.</font>

938
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'd
be like, "Why?"</font>

939
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'd be like, "Shut up," and I
hit you with the neuron, like...</font>

940
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd be like,</font>

941
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Oh, my God, why is
my vagina so sore?"</font>

942
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'd be like,
"You fell."</font>

943
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well played, Mr. Black.</font>

944
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've done this before.</font>

945
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he's a major beneficiary
of our university.</font>

946
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Interestingly enough,
he donates all cash.</font>

947
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Usually in ones,
fives, twenties,</font>

948
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the odd rolled-up $100 bill that's
got a little bit of powder on it.</font>

949
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please welcome
Mr. Christian Black.</font>

950
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you talkin' 'bout my business, huh?
Don't get cut.</font>

951
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Let's talk about
life and your purpose.</font>

952
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all spent four hard years in
this school getting your diploma,</font>

953
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">putting your parents in debt,</font>

954
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for what?</font>

955
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Between global warming and
the world economy crashing,</font>

956
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know why you're
trying to better yourselves.</font>

957
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give up hope!
Think about it.</font>

958
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are wasting time.</font>

959
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You. You're a drug addict
waiting to happen.</font>

960
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you. You can't wait to get
outta here and smoke some weed.</font>

961
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you!
You are a stripper!</font>

962
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your ass is twerkin'
as I'm sitting here talking.</font>

963
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can find
the rhythm in anything.</font>

964
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you, sir.</font>

965
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you're white.
You'll be fine.</font>

966
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, in closing,
I would like to say,</font>

967
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Thank God I'm not you."</font>

968
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kateesha! Oh, my God, we did it!
Girl!</font>

969
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so proud of you.</font>

970
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who you telling?
I was close, girl.</font>

971
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was one hand job away from losing
valedictorian to that bitch,</font>

972
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lindsey Hung, right?</font>

973
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking...
Shut up.</font>

974
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see that bitch,
she talkin' shit.</font>

975
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She gonna need a gynecologist</font>

976
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I'm done fucking
that bitch up! All right!</font>

977
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Girl, I'll see you later.</font>

978
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'mma go punch
a bitch in the throat.</font>

979
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lindsey!
You bilingual bitch!</font>

980
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So proud of you.</font>

981
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah!</font>

982
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

983
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so happy to see you.</font>

984
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! I'm so
proud of you.</font>

985
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I thought you'd
turn out not to be shit.</font>

986
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you ended up
looking real good,</font>

987
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">being that you
from a drunken whore.</font>

988
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. Yeah, your
mama's over at the rehab.</font>

989
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Twenty-seven times
is the fucking charm.</font>

990
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it? Yeah, it's
the fucking charm.</font>

991
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where are
my other stepdads?</font>

992
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right over there.</font>

993
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jonny Quest, B.B. King.</font>

994
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know who that nigga
is with his shirt off.</font>

995
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That must be your birth daddy.</font>

996
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's all good. What a
great bunch of guys.</font>

997
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you know the old saying,
"It takes a village."</font>

998
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's true.
Especially when it comes</font>

999
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to your mom being a gutter slut</font>

1000
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the village is a gangbang.</font>

1001
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The village is a gangbang.
Hannah!</font>

1002
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi!</font>

1003
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey, hold up, player!</font>

1004
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, how you gonna walk up and
kiss the girl that I raised?</font>

1005
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of shit is this?</font>

1006
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron, this is my boyfriend,
Christian Black.</font>

1007
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boyfriend!</font>

1008
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron, to be honest with you,</font>

1009
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just fucked her a few times.</font>

1010
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Boyfriend" makes it sound
serious, like I went raw.</font>

1011
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I might've
dipped, but...</font>

1012
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you thinkin'
about marrying her?</font>

1013
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1014
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if she get pregnant?</font>

1015
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still no, but hell no.</font>

1016
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like this fella!</font>

1017
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like this nigga right here.</font>

1018
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fucks with your stepdad.</font>

1019
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what,
from player to player,</font>

1020
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Black, I really like you, man.</font>

1021
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You can fuck anybody you wanna fuck.
Thank you.</i></font>

1022
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, just don't pass her
around like we did her mama.</font>

1023
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all I ask you to do.
Yes, sir, out of respect.</font>

1024
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We passed her mama
around like a baton, man.</font>

1025
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1026
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never told me
that about your mother.</font>

1027
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother fucked everybody
in the neighborhood,</font>

1028
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then wanted to settle down
with me, and I went for it.</font>

1029
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what, I gotta
hang out with you, man,</font>

1030
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">get your knowledge, man, 'cause
you got a lot of wisdom.</font>

1031
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a lot of wisdom
and I been through a lot,</font>

1032
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I done been
with a lot of hos</font>

1033
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the smells
that's on my fingers</font>

1034
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over all the years...
Oh, shit! What!</font>

1035
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still there. Never went away.
Oh! Damn!</font>

1036
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, sir! I smelled every
last single one of them!</font>

1037
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, man.</font>

1038
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was like beautiful and
horrible at the same time.</font>

1039
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've stuck my hands in some of</font>

1040
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the nastiest bitches'
pants all over the world.</font>

1041
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1042
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asia, Malaysia, Congo.
Hmm.</font>

1043
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Dubai right there.</font>

1044
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, I smell the hair.</font>

1045
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Touched a bitch's booty hole
in Dubai at the airport.</font>

1046
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you could probably spit a
lot of game to me, my nigga.</font>

1047
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's take a picture,
let me get a picture</font>

1048
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of me and you.
Make it a selfie.</font>

1049
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, baby.
Just me and him.</font>

1050
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready? One, two, three. Nigga!</font>

1051
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we going?</font>

1052
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations, Hannah.</font>

1053
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a car.</font>

1054
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With a broken window?</font>

1055
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you like it?</font>

1056
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. It's nice.</font>

1057
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I went
through to steal this car?</font>

1058
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean...
The car was a steal.</font>

1059
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just roll your eyes at me?
No.</font>

1060
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, there's only
two things I hate,</font>

1061
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you roll your
eyes at me and Craisins.</font>

1062
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, what is a Craisin? It's not
a cranberry, it's not a raisin.</font>

1063
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, it doesn't
even make sense.</font>

1064
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you just rolled your eyes
at me again! No, I didn't.</font>

1065
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you did.
I have it on tape.</font>

1066
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check this out.
Look at this.</font>

1067
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, what's she doing? She's
rolling her eye. Look at that.</font>

1068
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you do that? Come
on, you, with me, now.</font>

1069
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But...</font>

1070
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Teach you a little lesson about
rolling your eyes. Come on.</font>

1071
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1072
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, do you know
why I'm gonna punish you?</font>

1073
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you're a sicko
who likes abusing women.</font>

1074
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While there may be some truth
to that, that's not the reason.</font>

1075
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I rolled my eyes.</font>

1076
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bingo.</font>

1077
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1078
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna hurt you a whole lot
more than it's gonna hurt me.</font>

1079
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha!</font>

1080
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to my world.</font>

1081
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God! Fuck!</font>

1082
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, that hurt! Oh!</font>

1083
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you do it?</font>

1084
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow.</font>

1085
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, 15 across,
"winter beverage."</font>

1086
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing? You don't
feel nothing?</font>

1087
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love knitting.</font>

1088
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna spank me? All this
build-up is getting boring.</font>

1089
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, you wanna play?</font>

1090
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I got something for you.</font>

1091
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

1092
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough of your games. It's about
to get real dark in here.</font>

1093
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

1094
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna find something
that actually works?</font>

1095
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big brother almighty!</font>

1096
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

1097
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was my sorority paddle!</font>

1098
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1099
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Hannah,</font>

1100
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't wanna have
to do this to you,</font>

1101
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you've been a naughty girl.</font>

1102
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you break my fucking stool?</font>

1103
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1104
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm pretty good at this.</font>

1105
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1106
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't...
I don't understand.</font>

1107
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fucking hit you with everything.
I don't get it.</font>

1108
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't feel bad.</font>

1109
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't really felt
anything down there</font>

1110
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since I got my butt implants.</font>

1111
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll just... I'll see you back
at my place tomorrow. Yeah.</font>

1112
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you're in this room,
you do as I say.</font>

1113
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that understood?
Yes.</font>

1114
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, who?
Yes, sir.</font>

1115
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good girl.</font>

1116
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands up.</font>

1117
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn around.
On your knees.</font>

1118
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay.</font>

1119
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look at me!</font>

1120
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raise your hand.</font>

1121
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did that hurt?</font>

1122
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1123
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:18,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the pain
is in your mind.</font>

1124
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it! Motherfuck!</font>

1125
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And sometimes the pain
is not in your mind!</font>

1126
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jerk!</font>

1127
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a very important
question to ask you, Ms. Steale.</font>

1128
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Bin Laden?
What?</font>

1129
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Bin Laden? When was the
last time you saw Bin Laden?</font>

1130
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he?</font>

1131
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know!</font>

1132
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been dead for 5 years!</font>

1133
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't keep up
on current events!</font>

1134
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now the real torture begins.</font>

1135
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:22,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where were we?</font>

1136
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't remember the safe word.</font>

1137
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chapter 23.</font>

1138
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"It was a cold,
gloomy day in Seattle."</font>

1139
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, this book is 50
shades of fucking terrible.</font>

1140
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who wrote this,
a third-grader?</font>

1141
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please go back to
the water-torture thing!</font>

1142
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the safe word?
Stop it!</font>

1143
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your safe word?</font>

1144
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1145
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please just... Are you
gonna let me down now?</font>

1146
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Ms. Steale.</font>

1147
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I could just find these keys.</font>

1148
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't see the keys... No, I
know where they are. I just...</font>

1149
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, my arms are
really starting to hurt.</font>

1150
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got an idea.</font>

1151
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, most people use a universal
lock key in their sex dungeons</font>

1152
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for reasons just like this. Hmm.</font>

1153
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what you got here is
an over-molded swivel key.</font>

1154
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, that's a custom job.</font>

1155
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna need somebody else</font>

1156
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to take a look at this.</font>

1157
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.</font>

1158
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time, I'd put one of those
tracker app things on the key</font>

1159
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you don't lose it.</font>

1160
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are they called?
Oh, I know the name.</font>

1161
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's on the tip of my tongue.
It starts with a.</font>

1162
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ta...
Maybe Ten?</font>

1163
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Telepathy?</font>

1164
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, dipshits,
it's called a <i>Tile.</i></font>

1165
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tile!</i></font>

1166
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit, you're good!</font>

1167
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You went to college!</font>

1168
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell yeah!</font>

1169
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1170
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've picked a lot
of locks in my day,</font>

1171
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I've never seen
anything like this.</font>

1172
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, it's impressive.
Thank you.</font>

1173
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I got nothing.
Who's next?</font>

1174
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's next? What are you
guys, Ocean's Eleven?</font>

1175
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many more fuckups
are you gonna bring in here?</font>

1176
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stand back!
- Oh.</font>

1177
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the count of 3,
the Great Mysterio</font>

1178
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shall command these
shackles unlocked!</font>

1179
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One! Do not
divert your gaze.</font>

1180
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2! Illusion!</font>

1181
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3! Mysterio!</font>

1182
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
Um...</font>

1183
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1184
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that didn't work. All
the locks are still there.</font>

1185
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing happened!</font>

1186
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. I got nothing, guys.</font>

1187
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ.</font>

1188
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, speaking of disappearing, I have
a bar mitzvah in one hour. Mysterio!</font>

1189
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, damn!
Oh, my God.</font>

1190
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was not in the contract!</font>

1191
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where we going?</font>

1192
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To my parents' house for dinner.</font>

1193
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look lovely.
Thank you.</font>

1194
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd you learn to dance?</font>

1195
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At this little club in Tampa.</font>

1196
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dance!</font>

1197
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1198
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, wow.</font>

1199
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah! Fuck!</font>

1200
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

1201
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God,
he's got a baby dick!</font>

1202
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just the lighting! It's bad lighting!
It's creating shadow!</font>

1203
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not little!
You're just little people!</font>

1204
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1205
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you made it.</font>

1206
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah! It's so
good to see you.</font>

1207
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1208
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah, this is my dad, Gary.</font>

1209
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we ever happy
to meet you, Hannah.</font>

1210
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?
Oh, yes.</font>

1211
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was sure that
Christian was gay.</font>

1212
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's well-groomed,
loves Lady Gaga.</font>

1213
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't take his eyes
off of Anderson Cooper.</font>

1214
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of
Republican watches CNN?</font>

1215
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi! I'm Mai!</font>

1216
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so nice to meet you!</font>

1217
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe
you're a Republican.</font>

1218
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's his deep, dark secret.</font>

1219
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we?</font>

1220
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe you're a Republican.
Sorry.</font>

1221
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah...</font>

1222
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Black, this
food looks amazing.</font>

1223
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank you, Hannah.</font>

1224
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it was important to me</font>

1225
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that our adopted children were
exposed to their native cultures.</font>

1226
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, for Eli, I have
prepared Balangu.</font>

1227
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a spicy goat
dish from Nigeria.</font>

1228
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for Mai, of course,
we have Peking Duck</font>

1229
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the Mandarin
province of China.</font>

1230
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Korean!</font>

1231
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be fresh, Mai!</font>

1232
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are billions of
starving Chinese children</font>

1233
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who need their energy
to make sneakers for Nike,</font>

1234
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they would
kill for this meal.</font>

1235
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:07,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Christian, of course, we
have fried chicken and Kool-Aid.</font>

1236
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a very popular
dish in Detroit, Michigan.</font>

1237
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your favorite,
of course, hot sauce!</font>

1238
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Mom.</font>

1239
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Hannah, are you interested
in having children?</font>

1240
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I would,
if I met the right person.</font>

1241
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:28,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you have no idea what joy we
have had from having our kids.</font>

1242
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mai's the one that I
worried about the most.</font>

1243
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, she was so sweet.</font>

1244
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it seemed
almost inevitable</font>

1245
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that she'd grow up one day
and run off with Gary.</font>

1246
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like that little
director fellow, you know,</font>

1247
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the one that married Mia Farrow?</font>

1248
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sweetheart, please stop.
She's our daughter.</font>

1249
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a hot
little number, though.</font>

1250
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah, I would really recommend</font>

1251
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">adopting underprivileged
children.</font>

1252
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, that's really just so
sweet of you, Mrs. Black.</font>

1253
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a great conversation
starter at charities,</font>

1254
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it helps your social standing...</font>

1255
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it to me.</font>

1256
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your vag
doesn't get stretched out</font>

1257
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like an elastic band
at Cirque du Soleil.</font>

1258
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Mom.
Mom, please.</font>

1259
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was just nothing I
wouldn't do for my children. Hot, hot...</font>

1260
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I even learned to
speak Mandarin for Mai.</font>

1261
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not even a real language.</font>

1262
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit that bottom!</font>

1263
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah, where is
your family from?</font>

1264
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1265
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom lives in Georgia.</font>

1266
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Atlanta!</font>

1267
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, then your mom
must be a stripper.</font>

1268
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She actually lives in Savannah,</font>

1269
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she's just a housewife.</font>

1270
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure she is, dear.</font>

1271
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go and visit her,
actually, in a few days.</font>

1272
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drinks anyone?
Drinkies?</font>

1273
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have two.
I'd love to, Mom,</font>

1274
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I promised Hannah
I'd show her the estate.</font>

1275
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Home stretch! Yes!</font>

1276
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse us, please.</font>

1277
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's grocery time.</font>

1278
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like I'm on air right now!</font>

1279
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come you didn't
tell me about her?</font>

1280
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who, my mom?</font>

1281
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God, she has a nickname?</font>

1282
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you love her?</font>

1283
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, she's my mother.</font>

1284
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, how long has
this been going on?</font>

1285
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since birth.</font>

1286
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on, I can't
compete with that!</font>

1287
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you don't have
to compete with it!</font>

1288
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my boyfriend,
she's my mom.</font>

1289
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're two totally
different relationships!</font>

1290
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they're not! Okay,
Hannah, you're mine, okay?</font>

1291
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no mother, no brother, no
cousins, no second cousin removed,</font>

1292
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no friends that you call cousin
'cause your parents are close!</font>

1293
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's none of that.
No play cousins?</font>

1294
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No play cousins.</font>

1295
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian, what do you want?</font>

1296
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want Kevin Hart not
to be in every movie!</font>

1297
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? He's hilarious.</font>

1298
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, there's
other black actors!</font>

1299
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about them?
Like who?</font>

1300
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could've been Sam
Jackson in <i>Ride</i> Along-</font>

1301
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who knows what kind of crazy wig
he would have been wearing?</font>

1302
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you wanted me!</font>

1303
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want, love letters?</font>

1304
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hickies? Edible Arrangements?
Mmm.</font>

1305
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, that's not even real flowers.
It's fucking fruit.</font>

1306
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but it's delicious.</font>

1307
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's a start, okay?</font>

1308
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And maybe we could advance to
a Tiffany's engagement ring,</font>

1309
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a wedding where we invite
500 of our closest friends,</font>

1310
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then we have seven kids,
and we live in a big house...</font>

1311
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. You had this whole
thing planned out, huh?</font>

1312
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, is it me or
is it hot in here? Shit.</font>

1313
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to be
somebody that I'm not.</font>

1314
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, it's not me
that's changing you.</font>

1315
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's you that's changing me!</font>

1316
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

1317
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a line
from the movie Radio.</font>

1318
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not.</font>

1319
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, the movie
with Cuba Gooding, Jr.,</font>

1320
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where he played this
mentally disabled athlete.</font>

1321
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"It's not us
that's teaching Radio,"</font>

1322
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"it's Radio
that's teaching us."</font>

1323
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah, mine is way different.</font>

1324
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the same premise.</font>

1325
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You complete me?</font>

1326
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jerry Maguire, also
starring Cuba Gooding, Jr.</font>

1327
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand
your whole fixation on him.</font>

1328
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, all this time I thought
I wasn't in the right place,</font>

1329
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I was!</font>

1330
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Snow Dogs.</font>

1331
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it!</font>

1332
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta stop binging on Netflix.</font>

1333
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah!</font>

1334
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That song sounds so sad.</i></font>

1335
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not as sad as Luther Vandross'
Dance With My Father.</i></font>

1336
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, that song tears me up.</font>

1337
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every time I hear it, I just
wanna go, "Where's my daddy?"</font>

1338
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian, we have to talk.</font>

1339
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean like white people?</font>

1340
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with that?</font>

1341
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they just
talk a lot, you know?</font>

1342
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They do it differently
than black people do it.</font>

1343
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">White people don't like to
argue, they like to discuss.</font>

1344
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then they start throwing
around all these big SAT words</font>

1345
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and putting a lot of emotional
guilt on each other.</font>

1346
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just too much to deal with.</font>

1347
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like it the black way, you know,
where we curse each other out,</font>

1348
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we may fight, and then
we get cool again,</font>

1349
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we talk about each other
behind each other's back, like,</font>

1350
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Oh, nah, I ain't
fucking with that bitch."</font>

1351
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what you not gonna do...</font>

1352
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what you not gonna do...
You not gonna do...</font>

1353
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You not about to "not" me!
Uh-uh...</font>

1354
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let me get
to clappin', boo.</font>

1355
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hell no.</font>

1356
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, that's...
That's communication.</font>

1357
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel better already.</font>

1358
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian.
Hey!</font>

1359
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not upset
because I haven't signed</font>

1360
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the contract yet, are you?</font>

1361
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's not even legally enforceable.
You know that, right?</font>

1362
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's important
here are the rules.</font>

1363
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you break them,
you should be punished.</font>

1364
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you gonna punish me?</font>

1365
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First off, you'll get grounded.</font>

1366
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll make you stand in
the corner for an hour.</font>

1367
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I will
send you to your room</font>

1368
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without no supper, young lady.</font>

1369
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian, this is crazy.
Why do you need to punish me?</font>

1370
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'm 51
shades of fucked up!</font>

1371
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I'm 5-4
seconds from wildin'.</font>

1372
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got three fillets for fryin'.</font>

1373
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got 99 problems,
but now a bitch is one!</font>

1374
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's 100 problems, Hannah!</font>

1375
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can only deal with so much.
99's fine.</font>

1376
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A hundred jus... I can't
even count that far.</font>

1377
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1378
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you show me the worst.</font>

1379
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna see how bad it can get.</font>

1380
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more of this
pussy-ass punishment</font>

1381
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you've been doling out thus far.</font>

1382
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna go all the way.</font>

1383
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that something that
you think you can do?</font>

1384
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1385
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1386
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bend over.</font>

1387
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1388
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:47,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-mmm.</font>

1389
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1390
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aha.</font>

1391
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothin' says ass-whuppin'
like good ol' Joe Jackson.</font>

1392
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah.</font>

1393
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna spank you 6 times.</font>

1394
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to count with me.</font>

1395
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it, motherfucker!</font>

1396
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said count with me!</font>

1397
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One! Two!</font>

1398
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:34,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus! It hurts so bad I can't
keep count! Where were we?</font>

1399
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know!</font>

1400
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it, Hannah!</font>

1401
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how to count, okay?</font>

1402
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My crackhead mother
never taught me.</font>

1403
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about this?
Let's try in Spanish.</font>

1404
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spanish?
Si.</font>

1405
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tres. Cuatro.</font>

1406
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:56,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not too sure, but I think
cinco comes after tres-</font>

1407
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding me?
Cuatro comes after <i>tres.</i></font>

1408
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, don't get mad at me.
I don't know Spanish.</font>

1409
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, my crackhead
mother never taught me</font>

1410
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how to count or
how to speak Spanish.</font>

1411
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we gotta start from scratch!
No!</font>

1412
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

1413
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am tired. Oh, God,
that is exhausting.</font>

1414
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm gonna be sore tomorrow.</font>

1415
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Come on, let's get you up.</font>

1416
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch me!</font>

1417
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1418
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it make you
happy to see me like this?</font>

1419
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, not really.
You look like a sad Gollum.</font>

1420
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you's all bent over, and you're
crying. You look a little crazy.</font>

1421
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, don't hate me.</font>

1422
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hate you?</font>

1423
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loathe you.</font>

1424
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. That's a thesaurus
word right there.</font>

1425
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate you the way
black people hate cops.</font>

1426
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1427
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:01,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate you the way
Republicans hate ObamaCare!</font>

1428
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby, come on now.</font>

1429
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate you the way
Kanye West hates everybody else!</font>

1430
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm kind of
with him on Taylor Swift.</font>

1431
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that
bitch singing about?</font>

1432
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will never do
that to me again.</font>

1433
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said it was cool.</font>

1434
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know niggas, grimy niggas
who do not value themselves,</font>

1435
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they will have no
problem coming down here</font>

1436
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to fuck your little ass up!</font>

1437
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Slow it up now.
Just one "Cuckoo!"</font>

1438
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they will swoop down on you</font>

1439
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like pigeons on
old garlic bread!</font>

1440
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't be cuckooin'
on this mo'fuck!</font>

1441
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta calm them niggas down.</font>

1442
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?</font>

1443
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's try something else.</font>

1444
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, this is cute.
I get it, a little role-play.</font>

1445
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cute.</font>

1446
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Handcuffs. All right.</font>

1447
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You thought you were gonna
do this shit to me?</font>

1448
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You messed with the wrong bitch.</font>

1449
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sound angry.</font>

1450
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:59,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is for Kerry Washington
from De-jango Unchained!</font>

1451
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:04,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fucking... That is Django!
The "D" is silent!</font>

1452
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is for Lupita Nyong'o
in 12 Years a Slave!</font>

1453
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it!
It stings so bad!</font>

1454
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All she wanted was some soap!</font>

1455
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even the antibacterial soap!</font>

1456
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is for Denzel Washington.</font>

1457
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, he's not even a woman.</font>

1458
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're just getting crazy.</font>

1459
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they made him cry in Glory.</font>

1460
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who makes Denzel
Washington cry? Nobody!</font>

1461
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You talkin' 'bout like this?</font>

1462
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, look, I have a <i>Glory</i> tear.</font>

1463
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it wasn't for
Denzel Washington,</font>

1464
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Flight would've been
a fucking Soul Plane!</i></font>

1465
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

1466
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the fuck did they
make Soul Plane anyway?</font>

1467
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is for the little white
girl in Fifty Shades of Grey!</font>

1468
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Johnson.
Dakota Johnson.</font>

1469
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had to be naked
the whole fucking movie!</font>

1470
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That shit was just gratuitous!</font>

1471
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo! Ah!</font>

1472
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:00,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It burns! It burns! It feels
like someone lit a...</font>

1473
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ass on fire!
Oh, God, it hurts!</font>

1474
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We done?</font>

1475
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, nigga.
No, we not finished yet!</font>

1476
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We not finished
with you yet, nigga!</font>

1477
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Where you
goin' with this?</font>

1478
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm about to get
medieval on your ass.</font>

1479
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to my world,
motherfucker.</font>

1480
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On, God!</font>

1481
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

1482
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This hurts so much.</font>

1483
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I Wish I'd died.</font>

1484
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!</font>

1485
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's tickling.</font>

1486
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian, I thought
you'd like it.</font>

1487
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's there to like!</font>

1488
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of sick pervert beats
you for their own enjoyment?</font>

1489
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian, you don't
want somebody like me.</font>

1490
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're exactly what I want.</font>

1491
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A broke college graduate
with a liberal arts degree</font>

1492
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and no future prospects.</font>

1493
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's exactly what I want.</font>

1494
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:16,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian, I've fallen head
over heels in love with you.</font>

1495
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Whoa!</font>

1496
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow it up. That is
not in the contract.</font>

1497
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, it specifically
says, and I quote,</font>

1498
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Bitch don't love a nigga."</font>

1499
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? And I
double-bolded that.</font>

1500
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew I should have had
you sign this contract.</font>

1501
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian, I think
it'd be best if you leave.</font>

1502
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out!</font>

1503
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine, you want me to leave? You want
me to leave? Fine, I will leave!</font>

1504
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Wait, time-out.</font>

1505
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

1506
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I live here.</font>

1507
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shouldn't you be the one leaving?
Am I wrong?</font>

1508
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take an umbrella 'cause...</font>

1509
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bitch, it's raining.</font>

1510
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need my car back.</font>

1511
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I already sold
that piece of shit.</font>

1512
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll send you a check for $37.</font>

1513
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is way below Blue Book!</font>

1514
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:09,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah!</font>

1515
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian, you have
to let me go.</font>

1516
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, listen to me!</font>

1517
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you listen to me.</font>

1518
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll find someone. Somebody
who wants to be open</font>

1519
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to all the demeaning things
that you wanna do to them.</font>

1520
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah!</font>

1521
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian.</font>

1522
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh.</font>

1523
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1524
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God!</font>

1525
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is he gonna love you?
He doesn't even love himself.</font>

1526
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see his haircut, girl?</font>

1527
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:45,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could you think
this was gonna end well?</font>

1528
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never look back.</font>

1529
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christian.</font>

1530
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hannah.</font>

1531
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While running down
47 flights of stairs,</font>

1532
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had plenty of time to think.</font>

1533
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when I passed
out on the 23rd floor,</font>

1534
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I realized I owed
you an apology.</font>

1535
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to say I'm sorry
for the way I treated you.</font>

1536
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially for the whole
waterboarding thing.</font>

1537
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turns out you were
right about bin Laden.</font>

1538
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who knew?
Everyone.</font>

1539
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

1540
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hurt me, Christian.</font>

1541
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. But I have
softer whips.</font>

1542
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the kind
with the pink fur on it?</font>

1543
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It takes the sting off.</font>

1544
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not what
I'm talking about.</font>

1545
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want romance.
I deserve it.</font>

1546
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what's more romantic</font>

1547
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than running down
47 flights of stairs?</font>

1548
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I pulled a hamstring?</font>

1549
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you die?</font>

1550
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but that's gonna keep me out of
the Red Room for at least a week.</font>

1551
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, bitch.</font>

1552
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, okay. Hannah, wait, wait.
Hannah!</font>

1553
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Christian.
You are incapable</font>

1554
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of having a normal relationship.</font>

1555
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, but I'm trying, okay?</font>

1556
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to be like that old man
whose wife has Alzheimer's,</font>

1557
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he wakes up every day</font>

1558
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he tells her the story
about their lives together.</font>

1559
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then they take a nap,
but they don't wake up.</font>

1560
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because they're dead.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's The Notebook.</i></font>

1562
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the one with Ryan Gosling</font>

1563
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the girl with
the big-ass forehead?</font>

1564
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1565
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He never forgot her.</font>

1566
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't even like
Nicholas Sparks movies.</font>

1567
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to hate them,
but now I love 'em.</font>

1569
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why was that even a movie?</font>

1570
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that
wasn't even a book?</font>

1571
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if I'm gonna
give you another chance,</font>

1572
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">things have to be different.</font>

1573
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1574
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have something very
important I wanna tell you.</font>

1575
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lo...</font>

1576
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lo...</font>

1577
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I...</font>

1578
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm trying
to say is, I love.</font>

1579
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Empire.</i></font>

1580
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That Cookie just says
the craziest things.</font>

1581
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1582
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1583
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you loved me.</font>

1584
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have one last
surprise for you.</font>

1585
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're gonna have to pack a bag.</font>

1586
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we gonna go on
your private jet?</font>

1587
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God,
what kind of jet is it?</font>

1588
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. Don't tell me.
I want to be surprised.</font>

1589
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1590
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe you thought I'd
take you on a private jet.</font>

1591
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you and all, but you
don't even have a ring yet.</font>
