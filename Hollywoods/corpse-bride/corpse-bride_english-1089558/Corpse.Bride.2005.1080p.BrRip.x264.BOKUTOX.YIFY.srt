00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,758

- It's not me. It's my dress is caught.

22
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:27,770
Where is Victor? We might be late.

23
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,679

What if Victor and I
don't like each other?

47
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,124
As if that has anything
to do with marriage.

48
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,928
Do you suppose your father and I
like each other?

49
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,627
Surely you must a little?

50
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,737
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

51
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,841
Get those corsets laced properly.

52
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,876
I can hear you speak without gasping.

53
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,550
You've certainly hooked a winner
this time, Victor.

54
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,487
- Now, all you have to do is reel her in.
- I'm already reeling, Mother.

55
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,786
Shouldn't Victoria Everglot
be marrying a lord or something?

56
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,294
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit
as good as the Everglots.

57
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,834
I always knew I deserved better
than a fish merchant's life.

58
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,301
But I've never even spoken to her.

59
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,066
Well, at least we have that
in our favour.

60
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,235
Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.

61
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,245
Marriage is a partnership,
a little tit for tat.

62
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,189
You'd think a lifetime watching us...

70
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,937
Look at the way you're standing.

71
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:25,879
You look like you got rickets
or something...

72
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:39,627
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur!
Such impeccable taste!

73
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,664
Oh, beautiful, innit?

74
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,430
It's not as big as our place, dear.

75
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,307
- Bit shabby really, isn't it?
- Shut up.

76
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,241
Lord and Lady Everglot...

77
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:58,076
...Mr. And Mrs. Van Dort.

78
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,741
Why, you must be Miss Victoria.

79
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,619
Yes, I must say, you don't look
a day over 20. No. Oh, yes.

80
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,422
Smile, darling, smile.

81
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:18,561
Well, hello. What a pleasure.
Welcome to our home.

82
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,333
Thank you.

83
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,839
We'll be taking tea
in the west drawing room.

84
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,871
Oh, do come this way,
it's just through there.

85
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:32,279
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.
Who is your decorator?

86
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,476
Nice tiles, shame about the drapes.

87
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:38,145
My husband says such foolish things.
Ignore him.

88
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,750
Yes, it's usually best.

89
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,742
- Do forgive me.
- You play beautifully.

90
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:18,185
I... I... I do apologize, Miss Everglot.
How rude of me to... Well...

91
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,414
Excuse me.

92
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,124
Mother won't let me near the piano.

93
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,129
Music is improper for a young lady.

94
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,858
Too passionate, she says.

95
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:34,836
If I may ask, Miss Everglot...

96
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,305
...where is your chaperon?

97
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:42,177
Perhaps, in...
In view of the circumstances...

98
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,512
...you could call me Victoria.

99
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,646
Yes, of course. Well...

100
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,890
- Victoria...
- Yes, Victor.

101
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,787
Tomorrow, we are to be m...

102
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,727
M... M...

103
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:03,294
- Married.
- Yes. Married.

104
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,798
Since I was a child, I've...
I've dreamt of my wedding day.

105
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,343
I always hoped to find someone
I was deeply in love with.

106
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,711
Someone to spend
the rest of my life with.

107
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,046
- Silly, isn't it?
- Yes, silly.

108
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,520
No. No, not at all, no.

109
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,680
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

110
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,292
What impropriety is this?

111
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,457
You shouldn't be alone together.

112
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:41,163
Here it is, one minute before 5,
and you're not at the rehearsal.

113
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,800
Pastor Galswells is waiting.
Come at once.

114
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,415
<i>Master Van Dort,
from the beginning. Again.</i>

115
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:56,851
"With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows."

116
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:03,059
"Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine."

117
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:09,258
"With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness."

118
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:14,498
"With this ring, I ask you to be mine."

119
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,106
- Let's try it again.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

120
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,678
With this candle...

121
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,914
This candle...

122
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,013
This candle.

123
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,814
- Shall I get up there and do it for him?
- Don't get all aflutter, dear.

124
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,759
With this candle...

125
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,864
Continue!

126
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:49,137
Get the door, Emil.

127
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:53,537
Let's just pick it up at the candle bit.

128
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,980
A Lord Barkis, sir.

129
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,186
I haven't a head for dates.

130
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,348
Apparently,
I'm a day early for the ceremony.

131
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,656
- Is he from your side of the family?
- I can't recall.

132
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:15,459
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.

133
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,635
Do carry on.

134
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:28,211
Let's try it again, shall we,
Master Van Dort?

135
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,578
- Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Right.

136
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,652
Right. Oh, right!

137
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,985
- With this... This...
- Hand.

138
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,060
With this hand...

139
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:44,718
...I... With...

140
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,161
Three steps, three!

141
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:51,792
Can you not count? Do you not wish
to be married, Master Van Dort?

142
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,665
- No! No.
- You do not?

143
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,832
No! I meant, no,
I do not, not wish to be married.

144
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,410
That is, I want very much to...

145
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,845
Pay attention! Have you
even remembered to bring the ring?

146
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,645
The ring? Yes. Of course.

147
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,454
- Dropping the ring.
- Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!

148
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:17,356
- This boy doesn't want to get married.
- How disgraceful!

149
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,424
Excuse me. Got it!

150
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,332
Out of the way, you ninny.

151
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:30,835
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on, there's a
woman on fire! Help! Emergency!

152
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:36,877
- Oh, I hope it doesn't stain.
- Stop fanning it, you fool.

153
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:44,815
- Get a bucket, get a bucket.
- I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!

154
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:58,770
Enough! This wedding cannot take place
until he is properly prepared.

155
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:05,901
Young man, learn your vows.

156
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,593
Well, he's quite the catch, isn't he?

157
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,039
Oh, Victoria.

158
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:45,449
She must think I'm such a fool.
This day couldn't get any worse.

159
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:51,715
Hear ye, hear ye! Rehearsal in ruins
as Van Dort boy causes chaos!

160
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,784
Fishy Tuesday could be canned!

161
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:02,628
Everglots all fired up as
Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!

162
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,796
It really shouldn't be all that difficult.

163
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,133
It's just a few simple vows.

164
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,369
With this hand, I will take your wine.

165
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,944
No.

166
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,876
With this hand...

167
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,711
...I will cup your...

168
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,443
Oh, goodness, no.

169
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,519
With this...

170
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:27,582
With this...

171
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,319
With this candle, I will...

172
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,588
I will...

173
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,393
I will set your mother on fire.

174
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:39,998
Oh, it's no use.

175
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:57,180
With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

176
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:02,020
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

177
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,991
Mrs. Everglot.

178
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,861
You look ravishing this evening.

179
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,797
What's that, Mr. Everglot?
Call you "Dad"? If you insist, sir.

180
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:18,466
With this candle,
I will light your way in darkness.

181
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,638
With this ring...

182
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:25,008
...I ask you to be mine.

183
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,664
I do.

184
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:51,295
You may kiss the bride.

185
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,499
- A new arrival.
- He must've fainted.

186
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,471
- Are you all right?
- What...? What happened?

187
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,703
By Jove, man. Looks like
we've got ourselves a breather.

188
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:11,013
- Does he have a dead brother?
- He's still soft.

189
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,646
A toast, then.

190
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,951
To the newlyweds.

191
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,356
Newlyweds?

192
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,426
In the woods,
you said your vows so perfectly.

193
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,193
I did?

194
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,802
I did.

195
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,201
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

196
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,268
Coming through, coming through.

197
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,312
My name is Paul, I am the head waiter.

198
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:47,442
I will be creating your wedding feast.

199
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,052
Wedding feast! I'm salivating.

200
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:52,250
Maggots.

201
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,752
Keep away!

202
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:05,400
I've got a...
I've got a dwarf.

203
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,869
And I'm not afraid to use him.
I want some questions. Now!

204
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,999
- Answers. I think you mean "answers."
- Thank you, yes, answers.

205
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,773
I need answers.
What's going on here? Where am I?

206
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,074
Who are you?

207
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,617
Well, that's kind of a long story.

208
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:24,385
What a story it is.

209
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,117
A tragic tale of romance, passion...

210
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,090
...and murder most foul.

211
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,854
This is gonna be good.

212
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,626

Victoria, come away from the window.

267
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,344
Oh, I'm sure he'll be back shortly.

268
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,718
He's terrified of the dark.
In fact, when he was a boy...

269
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,952
...he used to wet his combinations
regularly, didn't he, William?

270
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,323
Enter.

271
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,296
Lord Barkis.
I trust the room is to your liking.

272
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:37,032
Thank you,
you are a most gracious hostess.

273
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:43,340
Which is why it pains me
to be the bearer of such bad news.

274
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:51,114
Would you care
to repeat tonight's headline for us?

275
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,280
Hear ye, hear ye!

276
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:58,051
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the
bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!

277
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:02,689
The dark-haired temptress and Master
Van Dort slipped away into the night!

278
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,732
And now, the weather.
Scattered showers...

279
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,371
Enough! That will be all.

280
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:13,868
Mystery woman?
He doesn't even know any women!

281
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,104
Or so you thought.

282
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:19,381
Do call for me
if you need my assistance...

283
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,617
...in any way.

284
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,057
Good heavens, Finis,
what should we do?

285
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,715
Fetch me musket.

286
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:30,326
William, do something.

287
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,020
The town crier
probably just had a slow news day.

288
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,996
You know how it is,
you need a little something to cry about.

289
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:40,661
Regardless, we are one groom short
for the wedding tomorrow.

290
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,002
Not to mention
the financial implications.

291
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,973
A most scandalous embarrassment
for us all.

292
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:50,581
Oh, give us a chance to find him,
we beg of you.

293
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:54,582
- Just give us until dawn.
- Very well. Till dawn.

294
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:58,744
Victor, darling, where are you?

295
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,853
<i>If you ask me,
your boyfriend is kind of jumpy.</i>

296
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,427
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my husband.

297
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,031
Victor, where have you gone?

298
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,061
I'll keep an eye out for him.

299
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,524
Victor?

300
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:18,765
There he goes, there he goes!
He's... He's getting away!

301
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:21,002
Quick, quick, after him!

302
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,407
Victor.

303
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,075
Thank you.

304
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,819
Victor!

305
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,347
Where are you?

306
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,884
Victor?

307
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,587
Where have you gone?

308
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,691
Married, huh? I'm a widow.

309
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:45,665
Oh, how rude. He went that way!

310
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,067
Victor.

311
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:52,104
Victor, darling.

312
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,342
Please. There's been a mistake.
I'm not dead.

313
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,850
Excuse me. Excuse me.

314
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,915
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

315
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:07,981
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

316
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,260
Victor.

317
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,290
- Dead end.
- Victor!

318
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,033
Hello!

319
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,135
Could have used the stairs, silly.

320
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:34,813
Isn't the view beautiful?
It takes my breath away.

321
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,284
Well, it would if I had any.

322
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,153
Isn't it romantic?

323
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,832
Look, I am terribly sorry
about what's happened to you...

324
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,303
...and I'd like to help,
but I really need to get home.

325
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,637
- This is your home now.
- But I don't even know your name.

326
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:03,269
<i>Well, that's a great way
to start a marriage.</i>

327
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,847
Shut up!

328
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,718
- It's Emily.
- Emily.

329
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:13,721
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

330
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,683
It's a wedding present.

331
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:31,104
Thank you.

332
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,293
Scraps?

333
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,134
Scraps!

334
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,261
My dog, Scraps!

335
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,743
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.

336
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,071
I knew you'd be happy to see him.

337
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,444
Who's my good boy?
Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.

338
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,882
Good boy, Scraps.
Roll over. Roll over.

339
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,955
Good boy, Scraps.
Play dead.

340
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,124
Sorry.

341
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,187
Oh, what a cutie.

342
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,421
You should have seen him with fur.

343
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,132
Mother never approved
of Scraps jumping up like this.

344
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,737
But then again,
she never approved of anything.

345
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:36,729
Do you think
she would have approved of me?

346
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,441
You're lucky
you'll never have to meet her.

347
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,976
Well, actually...

348
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:48,249
...now that you mention it,
I think you should.

349
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,411
In fact, since we're, you know...

350
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,153
...married,
you should definitely meet her.

351
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,324
And my father too. We should go
and see them right now.

352
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,260
What a fantastic idea!
Where are they buried?

353
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:06,330
- What? What is it?
- They're not from around here.

354
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,028
Where are they?

355
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,668
Oh, they're still alive.

356
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,969
- I'm afraid so.
- Well, that is a problem.

357
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,509
What's that, Scraps?

358
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,815
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.

359
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:23,483
- Oh, well, if you put it like that.
- What?

360
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,379
Elder Gutknecht.

361
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:35,821
Scraps.

362
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,332
Elder Gutknecht...

363
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,226
...are you there?

364
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,209
Hello? Is anyone home?

365
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,545
Hello?

366
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,653
There you are!

367
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:04,726
Oh, my dear. There you are.

368
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,330
I've brought my husband, Victor.

369
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,296
What's that? Husband?

370
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,898
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

371
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:18,141
We need to go up. Upstairs?
To visit the land of the living.

372
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,539
Land of the living?

373
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:24,578
Oh, my dear.

374
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:26,543
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

375
00:31:26,715 --> 00:31:30,549
Now, why go up there, when
people are dying to get down here?

376
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:33,779
Sir, I beg you to help.
It means so much to me...

377
00:31:34,923 --> 00:31:39,019
- Us.
- I don't know, it's just not natural.

378
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:41,094
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

379
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:43,891
Surely there must be something
you can do.

380
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:48,462
Let me see what I can do.

381
00:31:48,804 --> 00:31:51,705
Where did I put that book?

382
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,610
I left it here somewhere.

383
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,112
There's the one.

384
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:21,427
I have it.

385
00:32:21,837 --> 00:32:26,501
A Ukrainian haunting spell.
Just the thing for these quick trips.

386
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:30,908
- So glad you thought of this.
- Me too.

387
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:55,902
Now, then...

388
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:58,504
...where were we?

389
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:01,800
The Ukrainian haunting spell?

390
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:13,887
Here we have it. Ready?

391
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:17,992
Just remember, when you
want to come back, say "Hopscotch."

392
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,890
- Hopscotch?
- That's it.

393
00:33:37,412 --> 00:33:39,642
I spent so long in the darkness...

394
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:44,514
...I'd almost forgotten how beautiful
the moonlight is.

395
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,078
Hey, I think you dropped something.

396
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:34,827
Hold on, hold on.

397
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:41,172
I think I should prepare Mother
and Father for the big news.

398
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:44,812
I'll go ahead and you...

399
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:47,114
...wait here.

400
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:50,310
- Perfect.
- I won't be long.

401
00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:54,087
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

402
00:34:54,256 --> 00:34:55,814
Okay.

403
00:34:56,558 --> 00:34:58,253
No peeking.

404
00:35:17,512 --> 00:35:20,447
If ever I see that Van Dort boy...

405
00:35:20,615 --> 00:35:23,880
...I'll strangle him with my bare hands.

406
00:35:24,052 --> 00:35:28,216
Your hands are too fat,
and his neck is too thin.

407
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,756
You'll have to use a rope.

408
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:45,470
<i>This is the voice of your conscience.
Listen to what I say.</i>

409
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,838
<i>I have a bad feeling about that boy.
You know he is no...</i>

410
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:54,313
Go chew someone else's ear for a while.

411
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:58,214
Victor has gone to see his parents,
just like he said.

412
00:35:58,854 --> 00:36:02,722
If I hadn't just been sitting in it,
I would say that you had lost your mind!

413
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:07,351
I'm sure he has a perfectly
good reason for taking so long.

414
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:10,726
I am sure he does.
Why don't you go ask him?

415
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:11,957
All right, I will.

416
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:16,696
After all, he couldn't get far
with those cold feet.

417
00:36:55,177 --> 00:36:59,170
- Victoria.
- Victor? I'm so happy to see you.

418
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:03,340
Come by the fire. Where have you been?
Are you all right?

419
00:37:03,885 --> 00:37:05,546
I... I...

420
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:07,085
Oh, dear.

421
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:11,518
You're as cold as death.
What's happened to you?

422
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:13,558
Your coat.

423
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:17,263
Victoria, I confess.

424
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,628
This morning
I was terrified of marriage.

425
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:27,665
But then, on meeting you,
I felt I should be with you always...

426
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:32,040
...and that our wedding
could not come soon enough.

427
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:38,452
Victor, I feel the same.

428
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:45,986
Victoria, I se... I se...

429
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:48,721
I seem to find myself married.

430
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:51,627
And you should know it's unexpected.

431
00:37:55,503 --> 00:37:57,801
My darling,
I just wanted to meet...

432
00:38:00,575 --> 00:38:03,237
Darling? Who's this?

433
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:06,847
- Who is she?
- I'm his wife.

434
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:10,808
- Victor?
- Victoria, wait. You don't understand.

435
00:38:11,286 --> 00:38:13,516
She's dead. Look.

436
00:38:17,192 --> 00:38:18,489
Hopscotch.

437
00:38:21,363 --> 00:38:24,161
No! No! Victoria!

438
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:31,005
You lied to me!

439
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:33,663
Just to get back to that other woman.

440
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:36,777
Don't you understand?
You're the other woman.

441
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:41,473
No! You're married to me.
She's the other woman.

442
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,883
She's got a point.

443
00:38:47,555 --> 00:38:52,720
And I thought... I thought
this was all going so well.

444
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:04,868
Look, I'm sorry, but...

445
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,507
...this just can't work.

446
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:08,609
Why not?

447
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:11,806
It's my eye, isn't it?

448
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,641
No. Your eye is...

449
00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:16,046
...lovely.

450
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:21,285
Listen, under different circumstances,
well, who knows?

451
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:26,059
But we're just too different.
I mean, you're dead.

452
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:29,253
You should've thought about that
before you asked me to marry you.

453
00:39:29,431 --> 00:39:32,958
Why can't you understand? It was
a mistake. I would never marry you.

454
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:06,061
Roses for eternal love.

455
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:09,535
Lilies for sweetness.

456
00:40:12,307 --> 00:40:13,865
Baby's breath.

457
00:40:19,681 --> 00:40:21,273
Why so blue?

458
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:24,509
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we are too different.

459
00:40:24,686 --> 00:40:27,280
<i>Maybe he should
have his head examined.</i>

460
00:40:28,823 --> 00:40:30,620
I could do it.

461
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:34,284
Or perhaps he does belong with her.
Little Miss Living.

462
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:37,829
With her rosy cheeks and beating heart.

463
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:42,531
Oh, those girls are ten a penny.
You've got so much more.

464
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:45,002
You've got... You've got...

465
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:47,664

Victor is married to a dead woman.

506
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:32,336
I saw her. A corpse!
Standing right here with Victor.

507
00:43:32,507 --> 00:43:34,065
Victor was in your room?

508
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:35,607
I have to help him.

509
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:37,301
The scandal!

510
00:43:37,478 --> 00:43:41,312
Come sit in your chair, dearie.
You're shaking like a leaf.

511
00:43:41,482 --> 00:43:43,507
Let Hilde fetch you a blanket.

512
00:43:43,685 --> 00:43:47,086
Fetch her a straitjacket!
She's completely mad!

513
00:43:47,255 --> 00:43:49,120
Come, Hildegarde.

514
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,325
Finis, come to bed at once.

515
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,049
What in heaven's name?

516
00:44:51,653 --> 00:44:54,645
Who could that be at this hour?

517
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,452
Miss Everglot.

518
00:44:57,892 --> 00:45:02,158
What are you doing here? You should be
at home, prostrate with grief.

519
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,026
Pastor Galswells,
I have to ask you something.

520
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,600
- This is most irregular.
- Please, I beg of you.

521
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:13,264
You are the only one in the village who
knows of what awaits beyond the grave.

522
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:16,171
A grim topic for a bride-to-be.

523
00:45:16,477 --> 00:45:21,312
It is a bride I fear,
which is why I must know:

524
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:24,044
Can the living marry the dead?

525
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,082
What on earth are you speaking about?

526
00:45:27,255 --> 00:45:30,224
Please, it's Victor.
He's married to a corpse.

527
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:32,888
He has a corpse bride!

528
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:36,758
There must be some way
to undo what's been done.

529
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:42,136
I believe I know the thing to do.

530
00:45:42,837 --> 00:45:44,168
Come with me.

531
00:45:46,974 --> 00:45:49,465
Victoria? Where are your corsets?

532
00:45:49,644 --> 00:45:53,341
She's speaking in tongues.
Of unholy alliances.

533
00:45:53,514 --> 00:45:55,778
Her mind has come undone, I fear.

534
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,077
It's not true! Let me go! Let me go!

535
00:45:58,252 --> 00:46:02,951
Thank you, Pastor Galswells.
Thank you so very much.

536
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:04,922
Take her to her room!

537
00:46:05,093 --> 00:46:07,527
No, I'm telling the truth.

538
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:09,560
Victor needs my help.

539
00:46:09,731 --> 00:46:11,961
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?

540
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:15,068
- Mother, Father, please.
- Seal the doors...

541
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:19,696
...and bar the windows. See to it that
she doesn't escape again.

542
00:46:19,974 --> 00:46:24,274
He needs our help! Oh, let me go!
Let me go!

543
00:46:24,445 --> 00:46:28,472
Will the mortification never cease?

544
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:31,846
It will be years before we can show
ourselves in public again.

545
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:33,281
What shall we do?

546
00:46:33,454 --> 00:46:37,083
We shall continue as planned,
with or without Vincent.

547
00:46:37,258 --> 00:46:39,522
- Victor.
- Whatever.

548
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:44,427
For that boy to toss aside
a young woman like Victoria...

549
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:46,624
...it's positively criminal.

550
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:50,999
Why, if I had a woman
like your daughter on my arm...

551
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:55,768
...I would lavish her with riches
befitting royalty.

552
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:59,606
Your lady wife
is a most fortunate woman.

553
00:46:59,781 --> 00:47:02,648
Alas, I am not married.

554
00:47:02,817 --> 00:47:04,682
I was betrothed some years ago...

555
00:47:04,852 --> 00:47:08,788
...but tragedy snatched
my young bride away.

556
00:47:09,023 --> 00:47:13,016
When one lives alone,
wealth counts for naught.

557
00:47:21,135 --> 00:47:25,037
Marvelous news, Victoria,
there'll be a wedding after all.

558
00:47:25,206 --> 00:47:26,503
You found him?

559
00:47:26,674 --> 00:47:30,132
Make haste, my dear,
our relatives will arrive at any moment.

560
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:34,111
We must have you looking presentable
for Lord Barkis.

561
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:37,045
Lord Barkis?

562
00:47:37,218 --> 00:47:38,742
He will make a fine husband.

563
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,253
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.

564
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:44,687
A far better prospect this time.

565
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:48,556
But I do not love him.
You cannot make me do this.

566
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:51,596
- We must.
- Please, I beg of you.

567
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:53,199
There must be another way.

568
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:55,301
Without your marriage to Lord Barkis...

569
00:47:55,469 --> 00:47:57,960
...we shall be forced,
penniless, into the street.

570
00:47:58,139 --> 00:47:59,572
We are destitute.

571
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:01,702
But Victor...

572
00:48:01,876 --> 00:48:04,401
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.

573
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:07,605
You shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.

574
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:12,546
- According to plan.
- According to plan.

575
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:44,945
Oh, my dear.
Oh, don't look at me that way.

576
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,453
You have only to suffer this union
until death do us part.

577
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:53,453
And that will come sooner
than you think.

578
00:48:56,764 --> 00:48:58,732
Oh, it's almost dawn!
Where could he be?

579
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,960
Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!

580
00:49:02,136 --> 00:49:05,833
Heartbroken bride to wed
wealthy newcomer!

581
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:08,669
Wealthy newcomer? It cannot be.

582
00:49:08,843 --> 00:49:10,606
Did he say corpse?

583
00:49:10,778 --> 00:49:14,612
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse
would marry our Victor?

584
00:49:14,782 --> 00:49:20,778
Oh, Mayhew!
Silence that blasted coughing.

585
00:49:37,338 --> 00:49:39,932
Mayhew, are you trying to kill us?

586
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:42,371
I think he's trying to kill us.

587
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:22,880
I...

588
00:50:24,118 --> 00:50:25,949
...think you dropped this.

589
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:36,393
I'm sorry.

590
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:40,528
I'm sorry I lied to you
about wanting to see my parents.

591
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:45,033
It's just this whole day
hasn't gone quite, well...

592
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:49,336
...according to plan.

593
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:56,501
Pardon my enthusiasm.

594
00:51:56,844 --> 00:51:58,903
I like your enthusiasm.

595
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:07,009
- New arrival! New arrival!
- Lights up!

596
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:11,890
Hurry up, boys!

597
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:16,456
Drinks for everyone.

598
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,722
Another pint, sir?

599
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:19,923
- No, no. Just a half.
- No, no. Just a half.

600
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:27,834
It is impossible
to get good help anymore.

601
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:30,738
Welcoming committee, coming through!
Coming through!

602
00:52:30,911 --> 00:52:35,712
- My name's Plum. Miss Plum.
- Mayhew?

603
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:39,652
Mayhew! How nice to see...

604
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:43,083
I'm so sorry.

605
00:52:43,257 --> 00:52:47,626
Oh, yeah. Actually, though, I feel great.

606
00:52:49,697 --> 00:52:53,565
Hurry up, boys. Can you not see
the gentleman is parched?

607
00:52:54,502 --> 00:52:57,403
Mayhew, I have to get back.

608
00:52:57,571 --> 00:53:00,131
They all must be worried sick.
How is everyone?

609
00:53:00,307 --> 00:53:04,266
Well, they're still wondering
where you slipped off to.

610
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:06,640
Oh, and Miss Victoria...

611
00:53:06,814 --> 00:53:08,372
Yes? Yes, how is she?

612
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:11,484
Well, she's getting married
this evening.

613
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:13,643
What? Married to who?

614
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:17,484
Some newcomer,
Lord Somebody-or-Other.

615
00:53:17,658 --> 00:53:18,989
But that's impossible!

616
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,321
Yeah, with you gone and all...

617
00:53:21,495 --> 00:53:24,862
I guess they didn't wanna
waste the cake.

618
00:53:26,734 --> 00:53:27,928
But how could she?

619
00:53:28,102 --> 00:53:31,003
Women, you can't live with them.

620
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:33,436
You can't live with...

621
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:40,506
Time to pick up the pieces and...
You know, and move on, I suppose.

622
00:53:41,615 --> 00:53:43,742
Speaking of picking up the pieces?

623
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:50,453
Victor? Where are you going?

624
00:53:53,627 --> 00:53:58,462
Miss Victoria, we must leave
for the church now.

625
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:02,324
Yesterday I thought my wedding
would be happy.

626
00:54:02,536 --> 00:54:06,529
Now I feel like I'm caught
in the tide, pulled out to sea.

627
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:10,404
The sea leads to many places, dearie.

628
00:54:11,345 --> 00:54:14,837
Maybe you'll land somewhere better.

629
00:54:20,654 --> 00:54:25,216
With this candle, I will light
your way in darkness.

630
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:36,931
With this ring,
I ask you to be mine.

631
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:45,337
I now pronounce you man and wife.

632
00:54:45,946 --> 00:54:47,914
Oh, oh, dear.

633
00:55:03,864 --> 00:55:05,798
I'm too late.

634
00:55:10,037 --> 00:55:12,528
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?

635
00:55:12,706 --> 00:55:16,938
He just walked off without saying
a word. Are all men like this?

636
00:55:17,111 --> 00:55:19,978
Well, I'm afraid none of them
are very bright.

637
00:55:20,147 --> 00:55:22,047
They get something stuck
in their heads...

638
00:55:22,216 --> 00:55:24,776
...and you can't do a thing with them.

639
00:55:25,786 --> 00:55:28,220
My dear, we have to talk.

640
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:32,723
- Let me tell her, please. Let me tell her.
- What?

641
00:55:32,893 --> 00:55:35,953
There is a complication
with your marriage.

642
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:37,953
I don't understand.

643
00:55:38,132 --> 00:55:42,569
The vows are binding
only until death do you part.

644
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,232
What are you saying?

645
00:55:44,972 --> 00:55:47,702
Death has already parted you.

646
00:55:48,942 --> 00:55:50,773
If he finds out, he'll leave.

647
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:52,969
There must be something you can do.

648
00:55:53,147 --> 00:55:55,911
Well, there is one way.

649
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,983
Oh, please, please, let me tell her.

650
00:55:58,152 --> 00:56:01,178
It requires the greatest sacrifice.

651
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:05,156
- Go on, get to the good part.
- What is it?

652
00:56:05,326 --> 00:56:08,022
- We have to kill him!
- What?

653
00:56:08,195 --> 00:56:12,928
Victor would have to give up
the life he had forever.

654
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:17,168
He would need to repeat his vows
in the land of the living...

655
00:56:17,338 --> 00:56:20,603
...and drink from the wine of ages.

656
00:56:21,442 --> 00:56:22,704
Poison!

657
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:26,104
This would stop his heart forever.

658
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,545
Only then would he be free
to give it to you.

659
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:35,179
I could never ask him.

660
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:39,455
You don't have to.

661
00:56:41,995 --> 00:56:43,257
I'll do it.

662
00:56:43,697 --> 00:56:46,632
My boy, if you choose this path...

663
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,667
...you may never return
to the world above.

664
00:56:49,837 --> 00:56:51,395
Do you understand?

665
00:56:54,842 --> 00:56:56,810
I do.

666
00:56:57,177 --> 00:57:00,044
Gather round. Gather round, everybody.

667
00:57:03,784 --> 00:57:06,344
We've decided to do this thing properly.

668
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,920
So grab what you can and follow us.

669
00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:11,649
We're moving this wedding party upstairs.

670
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:15,989
Upstairs? I didn't know
we had an upstairs.

671
00:57:16,163 --> 00:57:18,723
- Sounds creepy.
- Let's go!

You can't get married looking like that.

Quiet down now, everyone.

721
01:00:39,399 --> 01:00:40,866
Thank you.

722
01:00:41,902 --> 01:00:46,396
Elegant, cultured, radiant.

723
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,804
Victoria has found a husband...

724
01:00:49,977 --> 01:00:54,141
...with all these qualities and more.

725
01:00:54,314 --> 01:00:56,908
Serendipity brought us together...

726
01:00:57,084 --> 01:01:02,386
...and no force on earth
could tear us apart.

727
01:01:22,909 --> 01:01:25,241
There's an eye in me soup.

728
01:01:34,755 --> 01:01:35,744
Oh, sorry.

729
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:44,023
Fetch me musket!

730
01:01:44,197 --> 01:01:46,324
Fetch your own musket. I'm off!

731
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,730
Coming through. Coming through.

732
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:56,738
Excuse me, you don't know me,
but I used to live in your dead mother.

733
01:01:58,045 --> 01:01:59,672
Hey, hold on there.

734
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,707
I love a woman with meat on her bones.

735
01:02:04,951 --> 01:02:07,511
Finis, who invited these people?

736
01:02:08,488 --> 01:02:10,581
They must be from your side
of the family.

737
01:02:10,757 --> 01:02:12,019
Certainly not.

738
01:02:12,192 --> 01:02:16,151
Why, if my Grandfather Everglot could
see this, he'd be turning in his grave.

739
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:18,263
Finis.

740
01:02:19,766 --> 01:02:21,961
Where do you keep the spirits?

741
01:02:30,844 --> 01:02:34,974
In other news, the dead walk the earth!

742
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,417
Get back! Don't try
and sneak up on me!

743
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,057
Get back!

744
01:02:46,426 --> 01:02:48,257
I'll give you such a wallop.

745
01:02:59,806 --> 01:03:01,068
No.

746
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:02,606
Yeah.

747
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:18,887
Grandpa?

748
01:03:22,496 --> 01:03:24,020
- Bounder!
- Sweetie pie.

749
01:03:24,197 --> 01:03:25,630
- Monster.
- Buttercup.

750
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:27,596
- Cad!
- Gertrude!

751
01:03:28,068 --> 01:03:29,592
Alfred?

752
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:34,172
You've been dead for 15 years.

753
01:03:34,341 --> 01:03:38,209
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

754
01:03:38,378 --> 01:03:40,141
Ethel!

755
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,287
Wait. That's it.

756
01:03:52,459 --> 01:03:55,860
We're going to take whatever money
we can and get out of here.

757
01:03:56,029 --> 01:03:58,463
Money? What money?

758
01:03:58,632 --> 01:04:00,998
Your dowry. It's my right!

759
01:04:01,168 --> 01:04:03,159
But my parents don't have any money.

760
01:04:03,336 --> 01:04:08,035
It's my marriage to you that will
save them from the poorhouse.

761
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:10,301
Th... The poorhouse?

762
01:04:10,777 --> 01:04:14,611
You're lying. It isn't true.
Tell me that you're lying!

763
01:04:14,781 --> 01:04:18,581
Did things not go according
to your plan, Lord Barkis?

764
01:04:18,752 --> 01:04:23,553
Well, perhaps in disappointment
we are perfectly matched.

765
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:45,173
Be gone, ye demons from hell!

766
01:04:45,345 --> 01:04:49,406
Back to the void
from whence you came!

767
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,380
You shall not enter here.

768
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:54,111
Back, back!

769
01:04:54,287 --> 01:04:56,517
Keep it down, we're in a church.

770
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,590
Evening.

771
01:05:35,095 --> 01:05:37,393
Dearly beloved and departed...

772
01:05:37,564 --> 01:05:43,264
...we are gathered here today to join
this man and this corpse in marriage.

773
01:05:46,606 --> 01:05:48,574
Victor?

774
01:05:50,543 --> 01:05:52,010
Living first.

775
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,638
With this hand...

776
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:58,907
...I will lift your sorrows.

777
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,784
Your cup will never empty...

778
01:06:03,323 --> 01:06:05,314
...for I will be your wine.

779
01:06:06,226 --> 01:06:07,488
Now you.

780
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,725
With this hand...

781
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:17,199
...I will lift your sorrows.

782
01:06:18,705 --> 01:06:21,868
Your cup will never empty.

783
01:06:23,643 --> 01:06:25,668
For I will be...

784
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:32,979
I will be...

785
01:06:34,888 --> 01:06:36,515
Go on, my dear.

786
01:06:37,123 --> 01:06:38,886
Your cup...

787
01:06:39,592 --> 01:06:41,651
...will never empty...

788
01:06:43,863 --> 01:06:45,797
...for I will be...

789
01:06:47,934 --> 01:06:50,129
I will be your wine.

790
01:06:54,774 --> 01:06:56,366
She's having second thoughts.

791
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:00,571
I can't.

792
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,942
What's wrong?

793
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,047
This is wrong.

794
01:07:07,287 --> 01:07:09,380
I was a bride.

795
01:07:09,856 --> 01:07:12,450
My dreams were taken from me.

796
01:07:13,259 --> 01:07:14,886
Well, now...

797
01:07:15,395 --> 01:07:18,455
Now I've stolen them
from someone else.

798
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:21,690
I love you, Victor.

799
01:07:23,003 --> 01:07:25,369
But you're not mine.

800
01:07:30,744 --> 01:07:32,006
Victoria!

801
01:07:46,826 --> 01:07:49,954
Oh, how touching.

802
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:52,928
I always cry at weddings.

803
01:07:54,234 --> 01:07:58,568
Our young lovers together at last.

804
01:07:58,738 --> 01:08:02,697
Surely now they can live
happily ever after.

805
01:08:03,743 --> 01:08:05,370
But you forget...

806
01:08:05,578 --> 01:08:07,671
...she's still my wife!

807
01:08:07,847 --> 01:08:10,475
I'll not leave here empty-handed!

808
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:13,011
You?

809
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:17,422
Emily?

810
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:18,784
You!

811
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:21,950
But... But... I left you.

812
01:08:23,063 --> 01:08:24,860
For dead.

813
01:08:25,665 --> 01:08:27,496
This woman is obviously delusional!

814
01:08:35,175 --> 01:08:38,474
Sorry to cut things short,
but we must be on our way.

815
01:08:38,645 --> 01:08:41,011
Take your hands off her.

816
01:08:42,015 --> 01:08:44,813
Do I have to kill you too?

817
01:08:48,188 --> 01:08:51,214
Victor, catch!

818
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:53,348
Sorry.

819
01:09:07,974 --> 01:09:10,340
I say, you're not playing fair, sir.

820
01:09:52,185 --> 01:09:54,085
Touche, my dear.

821
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:56,018
Get out.

822
01:09:56,756 --> 01:09:59,554
Oh, I'm leaving.

823
01:10:04,063 --> 01:10:07,055
But first a toast. To Emily.

824
01:10:07,233 --> 01:10:11,670
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

825
01:10:12,138 --> 01:10:13,799
Tell me, my dear...

826
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:18,034
...can a heart still break
once it's stopped beating?

827
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:22,514
Let me at him! Let me at him!

828
01:10:22,682 --> 01:10:24,240
- No, don't hold me back.
- Wait.

829
01:10:25,518 --> 01:10:28,146
We must abide by their rules.

830
01:10:28,321 --> 01:10:31,518
We are amongst the living.

831
01:10:31,691 --> 01:10:33,556
Well said.

832
01:10:49,475 --> 01:10:51,443
Not anymore.

833
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:57,882
Yep, you're right. He's all yours.

834
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:11,288
New arrival.

835
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:21,930
Oh, Victor,
I never thought I'd see you again.

836
01:11:29,282 --> 01:11:30,772
Wait.

837
01:11:31,551 --> 01:11:33,781
I made a promise.

838
01:11:36,489 --> 01:11:39,083
You kept your promise.

839
01:11:39,926 --> 01:11:41,894
You set me free.

840
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:55,765
Now I can do the same for you.
