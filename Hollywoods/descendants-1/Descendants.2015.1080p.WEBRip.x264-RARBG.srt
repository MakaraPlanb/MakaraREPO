1
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:17,200
<i>Once upon a time,
long, long ago...</i>

2
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:19,698
<i>Well, more like
20 years ago.</i>

3
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:22,734
<i>Belle married her beast
in front of 6,000</i>

4
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,571
<i>of their closest
personal friends.</i>

5
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:26,939
<i>Big cake.</i>

6
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:28,840
<i>Yeah, so instead
of a honeymoon,</i>

7
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,609
<i>beast united
all of the kingdoms</i>

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,746
<i>and got himself elected king of
the United States of Auradon.</i>

9
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:37,683
<i>He rounded up all the
villains and sidekicks,</i>

10
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:39,551
<i>basically all the really
interesting people,</i>

11
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:42,588
<i>and he booted them off
to the Isle of the Lost</i>

12
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:44,923
<i>with a magical barrier
to keep them there.</i>

13
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,025
<i>This is my hood.</i>

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,760
<i>No magic.</i>

15
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:50,996
<i>No Wi-Fi.</i>

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,600
<i>No way out.
Or so I thought.</i>

17
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:56,802
<i>Hang on,
you're about to meet us.</i>

18
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:59,304
<i>But first this happened.</i>

19
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:06,200
Sleeve. Head.

20
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:07,946
Ah-ha.

21
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:11,016
How is it possible

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,018
that you're going to be
crowned king next month?

23
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:14,400
You're just a baby!

24
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:16,755
- He's turning 16, dear.
- Hey, pops.

25
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:19,758
16? That's far too young
to be crowned king.

26
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,861
I didn't make a good decision
until I was at least 42.

27
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:25,831
Uh, you decided to marry me
at 28.

28
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:27,933
Ah, it was either you
or a teapot.

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,769
Kidding.

30
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:32,070
Mom, Dad...

31
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,706
Ah! Nn-nnh!

32
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:37,175
I've chosen my first
official proclamation.

33
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,746
I've decided that the children
on the Isle of the Lost

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,681
be given a chance

35
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:44,216
to live here in Auradon.

36
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:47,419
Every time I look out
to the island,

37
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,014
I feel like
they've been abandoned.

38
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:53,592
The children of our sworn
enemies, living among us?

39
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:55,727
We start out
with a few at first,

40
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:57,996
only the ones
who need our help the most.

41
00:01:59,031 --> 00:01:59,998
I've already chosen them.

42
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:01,933
Have you?

43
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:04,236
I gave you a second chance.

44
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:06,504
Who are their parents?

45
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,907
Cruella De vil...

46
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,842
Jafar...

47
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:12,611
Evil Queen...

48
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,014
And Maleficent.

49
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,716
- Ah!
- Maleficent!

50
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,400
She is the worst villain
in the land!

51
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,388
- Dad, just hear me out here.
- I won't hear of it.

52
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:25,857
They are guilty
of unspeakable crimes.

53
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,893
Dad, their children
are innocent.

54
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:30,400
Don't you think they deserve
a shot at a normal life?

55
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,664
Dad?

56
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:43,241
I suppose their children
are innocent.

57
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:51,049
Well.
Well done.

58
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:55,754

Hi, Mom.

120
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,556
Stealing candy, Mal?

121
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,990
I'm so disappointed.

122
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,859
It was from a baby.

123
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:23,562
Ah!
That's my nasty little girl.

124
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,635
Give it back
to the dreadful creature.

125
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,837
- Mom!
- It's the deets, Mal,

126
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:37,609
that make the difference
between mean and truly evil.

127
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:39,600
When I was your age, I was...

128
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:41,746
- Cursing entire kingdoms.
- "Cursing entire kingdoms."

129
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,300
You. Walk with me.

130
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,017
See, I'm just,
just trying to teach you

131
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:50,655
the thing that really counts...
How to be me.

132
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,792
I know that.
And I'll do better.

133
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,929
Oh! There's news!
I buried the lede.

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,732
You four have been chosen

135
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,901
to go to a different school...

136
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:04,669
In Auradon.

137
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:07,806
- Whoa!
- Oh, oh, oh!

138
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,576
What? I'm not going
to some boarding school

139
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:13,945
filled to the brim
with prissy pink princesses!

140
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,781
And perfect princes.
Ugh.

141
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,984
Yeah,
and I don't do uniforms.

142
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,653
Unless it's leather.
You feel me?

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,624
I read somewhere that they
allow dogs in Auradon.

144
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:27,592
Mom said they're
rabid pack animals

145
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,794
who eat boys
who don't behave.

146
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:31,630
- Woof!
- Yeah, Mom, we're not going.

147
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:33,665
Oh, you're thinking small,
pumpkin.

148
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:36,368
It's all about
world domination.

149
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:38,670
Knuckleheads!

150
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:42,607
Mal...

151
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:46,544
You will go.

152
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,300
You will find
the fairy godmother

153
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,615
and you will bring me back
her magic wand.

154
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,684
Easy peasy.

155
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:53,885
What's in it for us?

156
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,955
Matching thrones.
Hers-and-hers crowns.

157
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:00,000
Um, I.. I think she meant us.

158
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:02,894
It's all about
you and me, baby.

159
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:05,864
Do you enjoy watching
innocent people suffer?

160
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:08,500
- Well, yeah. I mean, who doesn't...
- Well, then get me the wand

161
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:11,603
and you and I can see
all that and so much more.

162
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,972
And with that wand
and my scepter,

163
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:18,643
I will be able to bend both
good and evil to my will!

164
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:22,614
- Our will.
- Our will, our will.

165
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:24,300
And if you refuse,

166
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:25,917
you're grounded for the
rest of your life, missy.

167
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:28,553
What... Mom...

168
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,702
Fine. Whatever.

169
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,804
- I win.
- Evie.

170
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:48,673
My little evil-ette
in training,

171
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,000
you just find yourself
a prince with a big castle

172
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,745
and a mother-in-law wing.

173
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,681
And lots and lots of mirrors!

174
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:59,551
- Ah!
- No laughing. Wrinkles.

175
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh, well, they're not
taking my Carlos,

176
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:03,855
- because I'd miss him too much.
- Really, Mom?

177
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:05,790
Yes. Who would touch up
my roots,

178
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:08,693
fluff my fur, and scrape
the bunions off my feet?

179
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,895
Yeah, maybe a new school
wouldn't be the worst thing.

180
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,732
Oh, Carlos,
they have dogs in Auradon.

181
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,500
Oh, no! I'm not going!

182
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,400
Well, Jay isn't going either.

183
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:20,072
I need him to stock
the shelves in my store.

184
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:22,607
What did you score?

185
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:25,744
Oh. Ooh.

186
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:29,000
A lamp.

187
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,585
Dad.

188
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,787
- I already tried.
- Ah!

189
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:37,655
Evie's not going anywhere

190
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,758
until we get rid
of this unibrow, hmm?

191
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,593
What is wrong with you all?

192
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:45,697
People used to cower
at the mention of our names!

193
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:50,568
For 20 years, I have searched
for a way off this island.

194
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:53,671
For 20 years, they have
robbed us from our revenge...

195
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,499
Revenge on snow white and her
horrible little men.

188
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,400
Ow!

196
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,009
Revenge on Aladdin and his
bloated genie!

197
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:58,999
- I will!
- Pop!

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,845
Revenge on every
sneaky dalmatian

198
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,947
that escaped your clutches.

199
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,649
Oh, but they didn't
get baby.

200
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:06,017
They didn't get the...

201
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:09,854
They didn't get the baby!

202
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,999
And I, Maleficent...

203
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:15,560
The evilest of them all,

204
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:19,564
I will finally
have my revenge

205
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:21,032
on sleeping beauty

206
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:24,035
and her relentless
little prince.

207
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:25,770
- Villains!
- Yes.

208
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes?

209
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:29,774
- Our day has come.
- Hmm.

210
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:33,444
- E.Q., give her the magic mirror.
- Yeah.

211
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:35,880
This is your magic mirror?

212
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,882
Yeah, well, it ain't
what it used to be,

213
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,818
but then again,
neither are we!

214
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,720
- It will help you find things.
- Like a prince?

215
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:45,824
- Like my waistline.
- Like the magic wand! Hello!

216
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:46,360
Hello.

200
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,060
My spell book. My book.
I need my... that book.

217
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:51,696
Oh, ah!
The safe. The safe.

218
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,598
Queen, help me!

219
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,400
I never can
figure this thing out.

220
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:57,969
Voila.

221
00:10:58,003 --> 00:11:00,972
My spell...
Come, darling. Come.

222
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:03,641
Oh! ooh!
Oh, oh.

223
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:06,911
There she is. It doesn't work
here, but it will in Auradon.

224
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:10,782
Remember? When we were spreading
evil and ruining lives.

225
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:12,584
Like it was yesterday.

226
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:16,754
And now you will be
making your own memories

227
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:21,100
by doing exactly
as I tell you.

228
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:22,400
Door.

229
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:23,500
Oh.

230
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,599
Whoo! Let's get
this party started!

231
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,634
Carlos! Come.

232
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:30,902
Who is the fairest
of them all?

233
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:31,903
- Me.
- Ah!

234
00:11:31,937 --> 00:11:33,638
- You.
- Yes! Let's go.

235
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:35,807
- Now, recite our mantra.
- There's no team in "I".

236
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:38,643
Oh, run along.
You're making me tear up.

237
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:39,878
- My bag.
- Yeah.

238
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,713
- Dad!
- Coming!

239
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:58,997
The future of the free world
rests on your shoulders.

240
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:01,633
Don't blow it.

241
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:10,008
Mal!

242
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:26,791
Ah!
Smells like common folk.

243
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:29,060
Come back here, now!

244
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,597
Carlos!

245
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:33,932
Ingrate.

246
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:54,786
Bye-bye.

247
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,588
The jackals have landed.

248
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:01,826
Bring home the gold!

249
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,994
Bring home a puppy.

250
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:04,796
Bring home a prince.

251
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:23,007
You're looking
a little washed out.

252
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:25,550
- Let me help you out.
- Ew, stop.

253
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:26,884
I'm plotting.

254
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,020
Well,
it's not very attractive.

255
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:31,856
Oh!

256
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,592
These!
It's salty like nuts,

257
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,561
but it's sweet
like I don't know what.

258
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,930
Let me see.

259
00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:40,798
- Ew!
- Ow!

260
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:47,739
Look!

261
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:54,050
It's a trap!

262
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:07,592
What just happened?

263
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:12,530
It must be magic.

264
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:13,831
Hey.

265
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:15,867
Did this little button

266
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:17,635
just open up
the magic barrier?

267
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:20,705
No, this one opens
the magic barrier.

268
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:23,541
That one opens my garage.

269
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:25,943
And this button...

270
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,915
Okay.

271
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,718
Nasty.
I like that guy.

272
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:11,989
Oh! Ah! Ow! Stop!

273
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:14,525
You got everything else!

274
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,993
Why do you want
whatever this is?

275
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,829
- 'Cause you want it!
- No!

276
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,897
- Give it to me!
- Ow!

277
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:21,766
- Let go!
- Guys, guys, guys!

278
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,835
We have an audience.

279
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,904
Just cleaning up.

280
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,540
Get up.

281
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:31,976
Leave it like you found it!

282
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,911
And by that,
I mean just leave it.

283
00:15:39,718 --> 00:15:41,953
Hello, foxy.

284
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:46,757
The name's Jay.

285
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:52,797
Welcome to Auradon prep.

286
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,800
I'm fairy godmother,
headmistress.

287
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,668
The fairy godmother?

288
00:15:57,703 --> 00:16:00,605
As in, "bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"?

289
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,039
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
You know it.

290
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:05,977
Yeah, I always wondered what
it felt like for Cinderella

291
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:09,747
when you just appeared,
out of nowhere,

292
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:14,519
with that sparkly wand
and warm smile.

293
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,988
And that sparkling wand.

294
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:20,500
That was a long time ago.
And as I always say,

295
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,960
"don't focus on the past
or you'll miss the future."

296
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:26,631
It's so good to finally
meet you all.

297
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:29,700
- I'm Ben.
- Prince Benjamin.

298
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:32,703
- Soon to be king.
- You had me at prince.

299
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:36,941
My mom's a queen,
which makes me a Princess.

300
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:40,545
The evil queen
has no royal status here

301
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,400
and neither do you.

302
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,649
This is Audrey.

303
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:47,919
Princess Audrey.
His girlfriend.

304
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:49,654
Right, Bennyboo?

305
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:53,558
Ben and Audrey are going
to show you all around,

306
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:55,100
and I'll see you tomorrow.

307
00:16:55,961 --> 00:17:00,665
The doors of wisdom
are never shut.

308
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,700
But the library hours
are from 8:00 to 11:00.

309
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:05,536
And as you may have heard, I have
a little thing about curfews.

310
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:20,985
It is so, so, so good
to finally meet you all.

311
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,560
This is a momentous occasion,

312
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:33,931
and one that I hope
will go down in history...

313
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:35,866
Is that chocolate?

314
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,636
...as the day our two peoples
began to heal.

315
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,807
Or the day that you showed four
peoples where the bathrooms are.

316
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,776
A little bit over the top?

317
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:47,678
A little more
than a little bit.

318
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:50,214
Well, so much
for my first impression.

319
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:55,686
Hey! You're Maleficent's
daughter, aren't you?

320
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:58,656
Yeah, you know what? I totally
do not blame you for your mother

321
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,891
trying to kill my parents
and stuff.

322
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:03,694
Oh, my mom's Aurora.
Sleeping...

323
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:06,797
Beauty!
Yeah, I've heard the name.

324
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:09,934
You know, and I totally
do not blame your grandparents

325
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:12,670
for inviting everyone
in the whole world

326
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:16,574
but my mother
to their stupid christening.

327
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:18,643
- Water under the bridge.
- Totes!

328
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:25,750
Okay!
So, how about a tour?

329
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,718
Yeah? Auradon prep,

330
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,654
originally built
over 300 years ago

331
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:30,988
and converted
into a high school

332
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:33,323
by my father
when he became king.

333
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,772
Carlos, it's okay.

334
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:51,008
My father wanted his statue
to morph from beast to man

335
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:53,611
to remind us that anything
is possible.

336
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:54,845
Does he shed much?

337
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,914
Yeah, Mom won't let him
on the couch.

338
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:13,731
So you guys have a lot
of magic here in Auradon?

339
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:16,567
Like wands
and things like that?

340
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:20,400
Yeah, it exists of course,
but it's pretty much retired.

341
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,774
Most of us here
are just ordinary mortals.

342
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:26,544
Who happened to be kings
and queens.

343
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:27,712
That's true.

344
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:29,980
Our royal blood
goes back hundreds of years.

345
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:33,884
Doug. Doug, come down.

346
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:37,788
This is Doug.

347
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,703
He's going to help you
with your class schedules

348
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:42,593
and show you
the rest of the dorms.

349
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:43,728
I'll see you later, okay?

350
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:46,797
And if there is anything
you need, feel free to...

351
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:48,933
Ask Doug.

353
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:58,709
Hi, guys. I'm Dopey's son.

354
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:02,999
As in dopey, doc, bashful,
happy, grumpy, sleepy, and...

355
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:07,017
- Heigh-ho.
- Evie.

356
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:09,553
Evil Queen's daughter.

357
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:12,590
Okay.
So about your classes,

358
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:14,258
I, uh, put in
the requirements already.

359
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:15,860
History of woodsmen
and pirates,

360
00:20:15,894 --> 00:20:17,400
safety rules
for the Internet,

361
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:21,799
and, uh,
remedial goodness 101.

362
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,200
Let me guess.
New class?

363
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,840
Come on, guys,
let's go find our dorms.

364
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:36,714
Oh, uh, yeah, your dorms
are that way, guys.

365
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:43,654
Dopey, doc, bashful,
happy, grumpy, sleepy, and...

366
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,890
Sneezy.

367
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:01,772
Wow.
This place is so amaz...

368
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:02,400
Gross.

444
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:05,709
I know, right?
Amazingly gross.

369
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,011
Ew.

370
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:10,714
Ugh! I'm going to need
some serious sunscreen.

371
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,716
- Yeah.
- E.

372
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:22,793
Whew! That is much better.

375
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,847
Jay, what are you doing?

376
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,915
It's called stealing.

377
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,651
Okay, what's the point?

378
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:50,854
Well, Mal, it's like
buying whatever I want,

379
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:52,590
except it's free.

380
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:55,659
Okay.
So, you could do that,

381
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:57,928
or you could leave
all of this here

382
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,830
and pick it up
when we take over the world.

383
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:01,732
You sound
just like your mom.

384
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:03,767
Thank you.

385
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:06,770
You do it your way
and I'll do it mine.

386
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,572
Die, suckers!

387
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:10,708
Jay, come check
this thing out.

388
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:12,009
Man, it's awesome.

389
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:19,984
Guys!

390
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:22,553
Do I have to remind you
what we're all here for?

391
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:24,622
Fairy godmother,
blah, blah, blah.

392
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:26,957
Magic wand,
blah, blah, blah.

393
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:32,262
This is our one chance to prove
ourselves to our parents.

394
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,035
To prove that we are evil
and vicious

395
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,006
and ruthless and cruel.
Yeah?

396
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,641
Yeah.

397
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:46,644
Evie, mirror me.

398
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:53,918
Mirror, mirror on the...
In my hand,

399
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:58,589
where is fairy godmother's
wand... stand?

400
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,593
- There it is!
- Zoom out.

401
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:04,828
Magic mirror, not so close.

402
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:08,866
Closer. Closer.

403
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,935
Closer.

404
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:13,537
Can I go back to my game?
I'm on level three.

405
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:14,705
Stop!

406
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,974
It's in a museum.
Do we know where that is?

407
00:23:17,008 --> 00:23:21,645
2.3 miles from here.

408
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:27,851
Come on.

409
00:23:31,923 --> 00:23:33,591
Carlos!

410
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,025
Coming!

411
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:40,598
Come on.

412
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:45,936
Check your mirror.

413
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:47,605
Is my mascara smudged?

414
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:49,940
Yeah.
And, hey, while you're at it,

415
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:52,843
why don't you see
if you can find us the wand?

416
00:23:52,877 --> 00:23:54,845
Sure. This way.

417
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:31,782
That's your mother's
spinning wheel?

418
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:33,584
Yeah, it's kinda dorky.

419
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:37,554
It's magic.
It doesn't have to look scary.

420
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,990
"Magic spindle,
do not linger.

421
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,925
Make my victim
prick a finger."

422
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:46,797
Impressive.

423
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:49,667
I got chills.

424
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:51,569
Okay, you know what?

425
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:54,438
"Prick the finger,
prick it deep.

426
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:56,607
Send my enemy off to sleep."

427
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,984
Ooh!

428
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,667
Not so dorky now, huh?

429
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:31,709
Stand back.

430
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:35,300
"Make it easy,
make it quick,

431
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:37,781
open up without a kick."

432
00:25:37,816 --> 00:25:39,917
Ahh!

433
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:43,854
Coming?

434
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:48,559
- Come on, Jay.
- I'm good.

435
00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:50,561
Just trying to help.

436
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:55,032
Shh.

437
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:04,975
Carlos!
Coming.

438
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:09,780
So close.

439
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:14,752
Upstairs.

440
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:17,554
Come on.
Go, go, go, go.

441
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:18,956
Up, up, up, up, up.

442
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,558
Come on, guys.
Almost there.

443
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:22,860
Yeah.

444
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,644
Mommy?

445
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,014
Killer.

446
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:49,653
I will never forget
mother's day again.

447
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:53,757
Well, the wand's not here.
Let's bounce.

448
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:55,659

Whoo!

520
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,633
Jay, don't!

521
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,935
Wait, no!
No! Don't!

522
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:35,005
Ah!

523
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,642
A force field
and a siren?

524
00:31:38,676 --> 00:31:40,644

a little excessive.

Come on.

528
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:06,770
Hello? Uh, uh,
just give me one second.

529
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:07,838
One second.

530
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:14,811
Uh, yeah, yeah.
No, false alarm.

531
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:17,881

in the, uh,

532
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:21,017
LM 714 chip
in the breadboard circuit.

533
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:23,553
Yeah. Okay.
Say hi to the missus.

534
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,657
Carlos!

535
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:29,025
You're welcome.

536
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:36,432
Way to go, Jay.

537
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:38,568
Now we have to
go to school tomorrow.

538
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:48,545
If someone hands you
a crying baby,

539
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:51,681
do you,
A, curse it?

540
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:54,784
B, lock it in a tower?

541
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:58,522
C, give it a bottle?

542
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:01,625
Or D,
carve out its heart?

543
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,364
- Evie.
- What was the second one?

544
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:09,499
Oh, okay.
Anyone else?

545
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:14,471
Mal?

546
00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:15,772
C, give it a bottle.

547
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:17,774
Correct. Again.

548
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:19,909
You are on fire, girl!

549
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:22,412
Just pick the one that
doesn't sound like any fun.

550
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:25,100
- Oh.
- That makes so much sense.

551
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,550
Oh...

552
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:30,554
Oh.
Hello, dear one.

553
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:33,999
Hi. You need to sign off on early
dismissal for the coronation.

554
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:37,326
Everyone here remembers
my daughter, Jane?

555
00:33:37,361 --> 00:33:38,662
Mom, no!

556
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:42,432
It's okay.
Jane, this is everyone.

557
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:44,568
Hi.

558
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:46,999
That's okay,
don't mind me.

559
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,739
As you were.

560
00:33:52,543 --> 00:33:54,811
Ahem.
Let's continue.

561
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:58,715
You find a vial of poison.

562
00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:03,386
Do you, A,
put it in the king's wine?

563
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:06,623
B, paint it on an apple?

564
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:10,660
Or C, turn it over
to the proper authorities?

565
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:13,763
Oh! Ooh! get off.

566
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:15,365
Jay.

567
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:18,735
C. You turn it over
to the proper authorities.

568
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:19,669
I was gonna say that.

569
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:22,305
But I said it first.
Come here!

570
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:22,999
Ow!

333
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,420
Come on, who said it first?
Who said it first?

571
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:28,411
- Ow! Stop! Ah!
- Boys.

572
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:30,347
Boys!

573
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:33,516
I am gonna encourage you
to use that energy

574
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:35,652
on the tourney field.

575
00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:37,587
Oh, no. That's okay.

576
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:40,323
Whatever that is,
we'll.. we'll pass.

577
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:45,462
Jay, Ben, offense.
Chad, you're defense.

578
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:47,631
- Taylor, you're the shooter.
- Right, coach!

579
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:51,768
Hey. Hey! Hey, you.
Lost boy!

580
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:55,405
Put your helmet on.
Get out of the kill zone!

581
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,606
- Come on.
- Kill zone? Wha...

582
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:59,509
- Pick it up.
- Put it on! Two hands.

583
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:17,294
Ahh!

584
00:35:31,642 --> 00:35:32,742
Jay, it's me!
It's Carlos!

585
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:35,578
Wait, stop, Jay. Stop!

586
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:38,548
No, no, no, no. No!

587
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:51,494
Ahh!

588
00:35:53,564 --> 00:35:56,666
Oh, yeah!
Come on, let's go!

589
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,802
Oh! Whoo!

590
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:01,705
Whoo, Whoo!
Oh! Oh!

591
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:04,807
What just happened?
Who is this guy?

592
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:08,678
You! Get over here!

593
00:36:17,421 --> 00:36:19,356
What do you call that?

594
00:36:20,524 --> 00:36:23,426
I call that raw talent.

595
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,429
Come find me later. I'll show you
something you haven't seen before.

596
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:30,734
It's called a rule book.
Welcome to the team, son.

597
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:33,303
You ever thought about band?

598
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:36,606
I'll work with him, coach.

599
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,810
All right.
Let's run that again.

600
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:42,612
Whoo!

601
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:48,318
<i>♪ I'm rotten to the core. ♪</i>

602
00:36:48,352 --> 00:36:50,420
Ow.

603
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:52,689
I know, I know.

604
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:55,758
Those kids are trouble.

605
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,794
- Bye, Mal.
- Bye.

606
00:36:58,328 --> 00:37:00,964
Come on, Chad.
Give them a chance.

607
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:02,665
Oh.

608
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,302
No offense, Bennybear,
but you're just too trusting.

609
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:08,405
Look, I know your mom
fell in love

610
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:11,274
with a big nasty beast
who turned out to be a prince.

611
00:37:11,308 --> 00:37:13,676
But with my mom,
the evil fairy

612
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:16,379
was just the evil fairy.

613
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:18,381
That girl's mother.

614
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,650
I think
you're wrong about them.

615
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:22,652
I'll see you later.

616
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,999
- Hey!
- Hey.

617
00:37:31,228 --> 00:37:33,999
- How was your first day?
- Super.

618
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,299
You should really think
about taking this talent

619
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:37,734
off the locker
and into art class.

620
00:37:37,768 --> 00:37:42,300
I could, uh, sign you up.
What do you think?

621
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:48,200
Way to take all the fun
out of it.

622
00:37:53,684 --> 00:37:55,652
Huh.

623
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:05,428
Hi! It's Jane, right?

624
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:09,999
Ah, always loved that name.
Jane.

625
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,600
- That's cool.
- Don't go!

626
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:20,743
I guess I was just kind
of hoping to make a friend.

627
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:24,447
You probably have all the
friends you need though, huh?

628
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:26,100
Hardly.

629
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,800
Really?
I mean, with your mom

630
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:33,423
being fairy godmother
and headmistress?

631
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:38,600
I mean, not to mention
your own, um... personality.

632
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:42,900
I'd rather be pretty.
You've got great hair.

633
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:49,672
You know what? I have
just the thing for that.

634
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,343
It's right...

635
00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:56,779
Ah, here.

636
00:38:56,814 --> 00:39:00,350
"Beware, forswear,
replace the old

637
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,619
with brand new hair."

638
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:05,388
Oh, ah, ah!

639
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:12,295
Wow!

640
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:14,531
You almost
don't notice your...

641
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:17,267
Other features anymore.

642
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:21,471
Do my nose!

643
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:25,375
Oh, I can't.
I've been practicing,

644
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:28,745
but you know,
I can't do really big magic.

645
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:32,382
Not like your mom
with her wand.

646
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,417
I mean, one swoosh
from that thing

647
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:36,653
and you could probably have
whatever features you wanted.

648
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:38,555
She doesn't use
the wand anymore.

649
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:41,691
She believes the real magic
is in the books.

650
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:43,560
And not the spell books,

651
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:45,728
regular books with history
and stuff.

652
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:48,298
What a rip.

653
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:50,400
Yeah.

654
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:52,535
You know, she used magic
on Cinderella,

655
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,405
who wasn't even
her real daughter.

656
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:56,739
Doesn't she love you?

657
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:59,309
Well, of course she does.

658
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:02,445
It's.. it's just,
you know, tough love.

659
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:05,315
"Work on the inside,
not the outside."

660
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:07,450
You know,
that sort of thing.

661
00:40:07,484 --> 00:40:09,319
That's the face!

662
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:11,688
Yeah, and then just look
as if your..

663
00:40:11,722 --> 00:40:14,490
Your heart
is about to break.

664
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,597
"Oh, Mother,
I just don't understand

665
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:24,734
why you can't
make me beautiful, too."

666
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:27,403
- Think it would work?
- Yeah.

667
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:30,672
I mean, that's what
old Cindy did, right?

668
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:31,541
And your mother
bibbidi-bobbidi-booed

669
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:33,643
the living daylights
out of her.

670
00:40:33,677 --> 00:40:38,481
And, hey, if your mom
does decide to, you know,

671
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:42,619
break out the old wand,
invite me.

672
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:45,521
If I can convince Mom,
you're so there.

673
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:47,357
Yay.

674
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:48,725
Bye.

675
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:50,493
Bye.

676
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:57,500
Any chance he's in line
for a throne?

677
00:40:57,534 --> 00:40:59,802
Anywhere in line?

678
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:02,672
Chad. Prince charming, Jr.

679
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:04,807
Cinderella's son.

680
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:06,542
Chad inherited the charm,

681
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:09,999
but not a lot of there
there, know what I mean?

682
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:14,450
Looks like there
there to me.

683
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:16,719
Evie.

684
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:19,389
Perhaps this is just
review for you.

685
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:23,999
So tell me, what is the average
atomic weight of silver?

686
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:27,664
Atomic weight?

687
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:29,699
Uh, well, not very much.

688
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:33,336
I mean, it's an atom, right?

689
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:42,412
Let's see.

690
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:49,419
How do I find the average
atomic weight of silver?

691
00:41:49,453 --> 00:41:53,923
That would be 106.905

692
00:41:53,957 --> 00:41:56,792
times .5200,

693
00:41:56,826 --> 00:42:00,800
plus 108.905

694
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,499
times .4800,

695
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:05,999
which, Mr. Delay,
would give us

696
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,000
107.9 AMU

697
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:13,710
- "AMU"?
- I forget.

698
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:16,999
- Always a mistake to underestimate...
- A villain?

699
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:19,449
Don't make it again.

700
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:45,200
Okay. Carlos,
we're gonna do some sprints.

701
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:46,342
You ready?

702
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:49,479
Oh! Ah!

703
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:51,614
No, wait!

704
00:42:51,648 --> 00:42:54,450
- Sweet!
- No! Ah!

705
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:57,720
Carlos? Carlos!

706
00:43:02,626 --> 00:43:04,594
No, stop!

707
00:43:04,628 --> 00:43:06,529
- Carlos!
- Ben?

708
00:43:06,563 --> 00:43:08,331
- Ben?
- Whoa-whoa-whoa!

709
00:43:08,365 --> 00:43:11,367
Ben, help me!
This thing is a killer!

710
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:13,336
He's gonna chase me down
and rip out my throat.

711
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,304
This is a vicious,
rabid pack animal!

712
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:17,607
- Hey, who told you that?
- My mother.

713
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:18,900
Cruella?

333
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:21,200
She's a dog expert.
A dog yellerer.

714
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:24,380
Why are you holding him?
He's gonna attack you!

715
00:43:24,414 --> 00:43:27,316
Carlos, you've never
actually met a dog, have you?

716
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:31,387
- Of course not.
- Dude, meet Carlos.

717
00:43:31,421 --> 00:43:34,457
Carlos, this is Dude.
He's the campus mutt.

718
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:37,660
He doesn't look like
a vicious, rabid pack animal.

719
00:43:40,597 --> 00:43:42,665
Jeez.

720
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:45,501
You're a good boy,
aren't you?

721
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:52,708
You're a good boy.

722
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,100
I guess you guys have it
pretty rough on the island.

723
00:43:59,214 --> 00:44:00,650
Yeah.

724
00:44:00,684 --> 00:44:03,753
Let's just say we don't
get a lot of belly rubs.

725
00:44:06,323 --> 00:44:08,324
Good boy.
I mean, you're a good runner.

726
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:10,593
- You're.. you're fast, you know.
- Oh. Yeah.

727
00:44:10,627 --> 00:44:12,495
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

728
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:15,531
Listen, I'm gonna give
you guys some space, yeah?

729
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:18,100
You guys get to know each other
and just, you know,

730
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:20,736
- come find me when you're done, okay?
- Okay.

731
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:23,606
- I'll see you later.
- See you out there.

732
00:44:29,746 --> 00:44:32,348
Hi. Hi.

733
00:44:32,382 --> 00:44:34,383
Oh! Thank you.

734
00:44:40,424 --> 00:44:42,200
Is everybody at home
as pretty as you?

735
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:46,329
I like to think
I'm the fairest of them all.

736
00:44:48,565 --> 00:44:50,499
How many rooms
in your castle?

737
00:44:50,534 --> 00:44:52,435
Oh! Too many to count.

738
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,509
You really nailed
that chemistry problem today.

739
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:02,712
You're gonna have all
the nerds in love with you.

740
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:05,381
- I'm not that smart.
- Oh, come on.

741
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:07,617
No, really, I'm not.

742
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:11,621
But I'm.. I'm really good at
sewing and cooking and cleaning.

743
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:13,656
You know, like your
mother, Cinderella,

744
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,592
without the ratty dress.

745
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:17,760
See this?

746
00:45:17,794 --> 00:45:21,364
If I ask it where
something is, it tells me.

747
00:45:21,398 --> 00:45:23,366
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

748
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,702
Where's my cell phone?

749
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:29,600
It won't work
for you, silly.

750
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:33,442
No biggie. My dad will
just get me a new one.

751
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:35,544
- Prince charming.
- Yeah.

752
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:37,713
- And Cinderella.
- Yeah.

753
00:45:37,748 --> 00:45:39,982
Fairy godmother.

754
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:44,787
Hey, I heard her wand
is in some boring museum.

755
00:45:44,821 --> 00:45:46,855
Do they always
leave it there?

756
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:53,729
I'd really like to talk,
but...

757
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:56,565
I'm just swamped.

758
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,336
- Unless...
- Unless?

759
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,805
If you could knock all my
homework out along with yours,

760
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:06,342
then maybe we could
get together sometime...

761
00:46:06,376 --> 00:46:09,999
- Hang.
- Okay.

762
00:46:11,448 --> 00:46:12,948
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.

763
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:15,685
Bye.

764
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:19,400
- I couldn't help but overhear...
- Are you stalking me?

765
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,857
Technically... yes.

766
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:25,394
I, too, have a fascination
with fairy godmother's wand.

767
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:28,364
Which is another reason I look
forward to the coronation.

768
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:32,301
Perhaps we could sit next to each
other and discuss its attributes.

769
00:46:34,671 --> 00:46:36,999
Are you saying they
use it in the coronation?

770
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,376
Yes. And asking you out.

771
00:46:47,484 --> 00:46:51,387
Mom said, "if a boy
can't see the beauty within",

772
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:53,723
then he's not worth it."
Can you believe it?

773
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:56,625
- What world does she live in?
- Auradon.

774
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,763
- Mal, do you like?
- Yeah. It's cute.

775
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:04,600
- It brings out your eyes.
- I know.

776
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:09,199
- I'll never get a boyfriend.
- Boyfriends are overrated.

777
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,340
And how would you know, Mal?
You've never had one.

778
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,709
It's 'cause
I don't need one, E.

779
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:16,200
They're a waste of time.

780
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:19,482
I forgot
to do Chad's homework!

781
00:47:19,516 --> 00:47:22,518
Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no.

782
00:47:22,552 --> 00:47:26,422
And that is exactly
what I mean.

783
00:47:26,456 --> 00:47:29,592
Hey, guys! I'm Lonnie.

784
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:31,360
My mom's Mulan?

785
00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:36,732
No? Anyways, I love what
you've done with Jane's hair.

786
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:40,999
And I know you hate us,
and, well, you're evil.

787
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:43,906
But do you
think you could do mine?

788
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,608
Why would I do that for you?

789
00:47:45,642 --> 00:47:48,644
- I'll pay you 50 dollars.
- Good answer.

790
00:47:48,678 --> 00:47:50,200
I need to buy
more material.

791
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,516
Let's see, I'm thinking,
we lose the bangs,

792
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,200
maybe some layers
and some highlights.

793
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:58,687
Yeah, yeah.
I want it cool.

794
00:47:58,722 --> 00:48:02,800
- Like Mal's.
- Really? The split ends, too?

795
00:48:12,302 --> 00:48:14,270
Okay...

796
00:48:18,475 --> 00:48:23,345
"Beware, forswear, replace
the old with cool hair."

797
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:40,296
I know. I know.

798
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:42,331
It looks like a mop
on your head.

799
00:48:42,365 --> 00:48:43,605
You know what?
Let's cut it off,

800
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,535
- layer it...
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

801
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:49,371
- I love it.
- You do?

802
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:50,539
It's just...

803
00:48:54,544 --> 00:48:57,379
Now I'm cool.

804
00:48:57,414 --> 00:48:58,681
Like ice.

805
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:08,424
What did I just do?

806
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:11,393
Mom's gonna kill me!

807
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:14,296
I could really use
a tough guy like you.

808
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:16,491
The team's a bunch of princes,
if you know what I mean.

809
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,668
You're telling me.
It's all, "after you, old chum."

810
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:22,671
Oh, pardon me,
did I bump into you?"

811
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:26,442
Where I come from it's,
"prepare to die, sucker!"

812
00:49:26,476 --> 00:49:29,478
As my father says,
"the only way to win"

813
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:32,348
- is to make sure everyone else loses!
- Jay!

814
00:49:32,382 --> 00:49:33,449
- Jay, Jay, Jay!
- "You rip--"

815
00:49:33,483 --> 00:49:34,517
let me explain a team.

816
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:36,519
Uh, it's like a family.

817
00:49:36,553 --> 00:49:40,389
You do not want to be
at my house at dinner time.

818
00:49:40,423 --> 00:49:42,491
Okay, okay, um...

819
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:45,494
You know how a body has
a lot of different parts?

820
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:48,199
The legs, elbows, ears.

821
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,432
But they all
need each other.

822
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:51,934
Well, that's what a team is.

823
00:49:51,968 --> 00:49:55,404
Different players
who work together to win.

824
00:49:55,438 --> 00:49:57,306
Make any sense?

825
00:49:59,576 --> 00:50:01,100
Can I be the fist?

826
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:13,489
Yo-ho-ho!

827
00:50:13,523 --> 00:50:14,723
Hey!

828
00:50:17,627 --> 00:50:20,362
Did your plan work with Jane? Are
you going over to see the wand?

829
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:23,332
Do you think that I would be going
through every single spell in this book

830
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:25,233
if I hadn't
completely struck out?

831
00:50:25,268 --> 00:50:28,103
- Oh, someone's in a bad mood.
- My mom's counting on me!

832
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:29,405
I can't let her down!

833
00:50:29,439 --> 00:50:30,406
We can do this...

834
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:36,200
...if we stick together.

835
00:50:37,447 --> 00:50:41,584
And we won't go back
until we do.

836
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:42,818
Because we're rotten...

837
00:50:42,852 --> 00:50:45,200
To the core.

838
00:50:45,555 --> 00:50:47,456
Oh, yeah. I found out
that fairy godmother

839
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,924
blesses Ben with the wand
at coronation

840
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,759
and we all get to go.

841
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:53,529
I have nothing to wear,
of course.

842
00:50:55,532 --> 00:50:58,566
- What?
- Hold that thought.

843
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:05,700
Hey, Mal.
I didn't see you guys today.

844
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:09,311
I was just wondering if you had
any questions or anything...

845
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:11,413
That... you needed...

846
00:51:11,448 --> 00:51:13,582
Not that I know of.

847
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:16,998
Okay. All right.

848
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:19,555
Well, uh, if you need
anything, just, uh...

849
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:21,790
Oh, wait!

850
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:25,527
Um, is it true that we all
get to go to your coronation?

851
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:29,331
- Yeah, the whole school goes.
- Wow.

852
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,600
That is beyond exciting.

853
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:33,502
Do you think
that it's a possibility

854
00:51:33,536 --> 00:51:35,100
that the four of us
could stand in the front row

855
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:37,473
next to the fairy godmother,
just so we could

856
00:51:37,507 --> 00:51:39,608
soak up all that goodness?

857
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:43,379
I wish you could.

858
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:45,514
Up front it's just me,

859
00:51:45,548 --> 00:51:47,383
my folks, and my girlfriend.

860
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:49,800
And your girlfriend?

861
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:53,355
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
- Okay. Thanks, bye.

862
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,999
Oh, but, no,
there's plenty of...

863
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:59,461
I think it's time

864
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:02,765
that Bennyboo got himself
a new girlfriend.

865
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:04,466
And I need a love spell.

866
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:09,000
All right. It says that

867
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:12,374
we still need one tear,
and I never cry.

868
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:15,444
- Let's just chop up some onions.
- No.

869
00:52:15,478 --> 00:52:18,380
It says that we need
one tear of human sadness.

870
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:19,900
And this love potion
gets the best reviews,

871
00:52:19,901 --> 00:52:21,517
so we have to
follow it exactly.

872
00:52:21,551 --> 00:52:24,386
- A tear's a tear.
- That's not true, Jay.

873
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:25,721
They both have
antibodies and enzymes,

874
00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:28,900
but an emotional tear
has more protein-based hormones

875
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:33,495
- than a reflex tear.
- Listen to you.

876
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,100
- Yeah, I knew that.
- Did not.

877
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:36,999
Yeah, I did.

878
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:40,569
There you are, Mal!
I was looking for you.

879
00:52:40,603 --> 00:52:44,406
You know, all the girls
want you to do their hair!

880
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:46,709
Midnight snack, huh?

881
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:50,512
- What you guys making?
- Nothing special. Just cookies.

882
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:52,100
- Oh, no, no!
- Wait, wait, wait!

883
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:56,760
What? I'm not
gonna double dip.

884
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,488
Feel anything?

885
00:52:59,522 --> 00:53:02,424
Yeah, like maybe it
might be missing something?

886
00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:07,296
Hey, there.

887
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:15,400
- It could use some chips.
- Chips?

888
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,539
And those are...

889
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:19,475
Chocolate chips.

890
00:53:19,509 --> 00:53:23,545
Just the most
important food group.

891
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:27,800
Wait, didn't your moms
ever make you guys,

892
00:53:27,801 --> 00:53:29,585
like chocolate chip cookies?

893
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:33,622
Like, when you're
feeling sad,

894
00:53:33,656 --> 00:53:37,426
and they're fresh
from the oven,

895
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,800
with a big
old glass of milk,

896
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:39,998
and she just
makes you laugh

897
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:42,800
and puts everything
into perspective and...

898
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:50,506
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

899
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:54,443
It's just different
where we're from.

900
00:53:56,413 --> 00:53:59,715
Yeah, I know. I just,
you know, I thought...

901
00:53:59,749 --> 00:54:02,418
Even villains
love their kids.

902
00:54:05,555 --> 00:54:06,722
Oh...

903
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:15,597
How awful.

904
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:24,406
Yeah, well, big bummer,

905
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:26,100
but we have to get
these into the oven,

906
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:27,543
so thank you so much
for coming by.

907
00:54:27,577 --> 00:54:28,710
Really, really
have a good night.

908
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:30,646
I'll see you tomorrow.
Evil dreams.

909
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,780
Good night.

910
00:54:31,815 --> 00:54:34,316
See you tomorrow.

911
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:37,352
Okay, boys, cookie sheet.

912
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:38,654
- Evie, oven.
- Yes, ma'am.

913
00:54:47,497 --> 00:54:49,631
- Look, it's Mal.
- Hi, Mal!

914
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,333
Love my hair, Mal!

915
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:56,772
Are you feeling
kind of weird about this?

916
00:54:56,806 --> 00:55:00,342
I mean, it's not
so bad here, you know.

917
00:55:00,376 --> 00:55:01,677
Are you insane?

918
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:04,379
Long live evil!
You're mean!

919
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:07,649
You're awful!
You're bad news!

920
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:10,419
Snap out of it!

921
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:12,721
Thanks, Mal.
I needed that.

922
00:55:15,758 --> 00:55:17,700
Do you think they actually
paid for those?

555
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:18,900
Oh, hello.

923
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:20,629
The name's Jay.

924
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:22,500
You all going to the tourney
game tonight?

554
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:23,599
Yeah.

925
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:25,601
Keep a lookout
for number eight, all right?

926
00:55:25,635 --> 00:55:27,669
- Scoring the winning goal.
- Okay.

927
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:29,438
She did it
to Jane's hair, too,

928
00:55:29,472 --> 00:55:31,200
and fairy godmother's
not happy about it.

929
00:55:31,773 --> 00:55:34,343
- What's the harm?
- It's gateway magic!

930
00:55:34,377 --> 00:55:36,400
Sure, it starts
with the hair.

931
00:55:36,778 --> 00:55:39,348
Next thing you know
it's the lips and the legs

932
00:55:39,382 --> 00:55:43,800
and the clothes and then everybody looks
good and then... where will I be?

933
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:46,321
Listen, Audrey...

934
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:49,324
I will see you at the game after my
dress-fitting for the coronation, okay?

935
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,628
- Okay.
- Bye, Bennyboo.

936
00:55:52,662 --> 00:55:54,329
Bye.

937
00:55:56,499 --> 00:55:58,800
- Hey, Bennyboo!
- Hey.

938
00:55:58,835 --> 00:56:01,603
I just made
a batch of cookies.

939
00:56:01,638 --> 00:56:03,372
Double chocolate chip,
do you want one?

940
00:56:03,406 --> 00:56:05,274
Oh, I, uh,
I've got a big game.

941
00:56:05,308 --> 00:56:06,508
I don't eat
before a big game.

942
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:08,477
But thank you so, so much.
Thank you. Next time.

943
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:10,412
- Next time.
- No, yeah.

944
00:56:10,446 --> 00:56:11,647
I completely understand.

945
00:56:11,681 --> 00:56:14,416
"Be careful of treats offered
by kids of villains."

946
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:15,500
No, no, no.

666
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:16,900
No, I'm sure every
kid in Auradon knows that.

947
00:56:16,901 --> 00:56:18,487
No, that's not it. No, no, no, I...
I really do...

948
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:21,290
No, I get it.
You're cautious. That's smart.

949
00:56:21,324 --> 00:56:24,293
Oh, well,
more for me, I guess.

950
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:26,562
No, no. Hey...

951
00:56:26,596 --> 00:56:28,664
See that?
Totally trust you.

952
00:56:28,698 --> 00:56:30,699
Totally.

953
00:56:33,803 --> 00:56:35,771
- How are they?
- They're good. They're great!

954
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:39,308
They're amazing!
They're, uh...

955
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:41,310
I mean, they're chewy
and, and you know, they...

956
00:56:41,344 --> 00:56:44,413
Is that walnuts?
I love walnuts.

957
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:47,516
I mean, uh,
you know, the...

958
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,750
The chocolate...

959
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:51,687
The... The chocolate...
The chocolate chips are...

960
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:54,756
I'm sorry. Um...

961
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,730
Uh, they're...
They're warm and soft.

962
00:57:01,764 --> 00:57:03,498
And they're sweet...

963
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:08,637
Mal, have you always had those
little golden flecks in your eyes?

964
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:14,443
How you feeling, bro?

965
00:57:14,477 --> 00:57:17,412
I feel... I feel...

966
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:19,514
I feel like...

967
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:21,750
Like singing your name.

968
00:57:21,784 --> 00:57:25,520
♪ Mal, Mal ♪

969
00:57:29,692 --> 00:57:32,361
- Ohayohay!
<i>- This is a nail-biter, folks.</i>

970
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:35,330
<i>There's 47 seconds left on
the clock. We're all tied up.</i>

971
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:37,733
<i>The Sherwood Falcons, two.
The Fighting Knights, two.</i>

972
00:57:37,767 --> 00:57:40,502
<i>What a game between
Auradon's fiercest rivals.</i>

973
00:57:40,536 --> 00:57:42,638
- Get 'em, Chad.
- Thanks, Jay.

974
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:45,540
<i>The teams get into their huddles and
take up positions along the kill zone.</i>

975
00:57:45,575 --> 00:57:46,100
Akiho! 

777
00:57:46,101 --> 00:57:48,200
<i>The Dragoneers
have been laying down</i>

976
00:57:48,201 --> 00:57:49,511
<i>- a withering hail of fire.</i>
- You're up.

977
00:57:49,545 --> 00:57:50,746
<i>And now a substitution...</i>

978
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,348
Coach, how about
my buddy here?

979
00:57:53,383 --> 00:57:55,317
- Oh, no.
- Not so sure about that.

980
00:57:55,351 --> 00:57:56,585
- Coach, he's been practicing.
- Jay...

981
00:57:56,619 --> 00:57:58,754
And you said yourself a team
is made up of a bunch of parts.

982
00:57:58,788 --> 00:58:02,391
- Jay, I'm not that good.
- Well, he's kind of like my brain.

983
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,626
Come here!

984
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:08,463
You heard him.
Get out there!

985
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:10,298
Don't worry, bro.
I got your back.

986
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:13,468
- How about my front?
- Pfft. Get out there.

987
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:16,471
<i>He's bringing
that hothead Jay in</i>

988
00:58:16,506 --> 00:58:20,509
<i>from the Isle of the Lost and that little
guy Carlos can barely hold a shield.</i>

989
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,143
Break! <i>When they break
from their huddles,</i>

990
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,712
<i>this is gonna be
a big moment here.</i>

991
00:58:23,746 --> 00:58:26,448
<i>And the tipoff is ready.</i>

992
00:58:26,482 --> 00:58:27,649
<i>Here we go.</i>

993
00:58:27,684 --> 00:58:30,419
<i>Long pass goes to Jay.</i>

994
00:58:30,453 --> 00:58:32,487
Jay dishes off to prince Ben.

995
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:35,490
<i>Nice little block by Carlos.</i>

996
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:37,759
<i>He does a little dancing jig
in his opponent's face.</i>

997
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:40,362
<i>And now Jay gets the ball back.
Here comes Jay!</i>

998
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:42,631
<i>Jay, hurdling maneuver
at mid-field.</i>

999
00:58:42,665 --> 00:58:44,599
- I'm open!
<i>- Jay makes a nice pass</i>

1000
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:46,401
<i>to prince Ben
through the kill zone.</i>

1001
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:48,437
- Jay!
- Big block by Chad!

1002
00:58:48,471 --> 00:58:50,605
<i>Prince Ben moves over wide,
gives it back to Jay.</i>

1003
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,000
<i>He's in the clear! Shot!</i>

1004
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:56,445
Oh, what a save by Philip
the Falcons' goalkeeper!

1005
00:58:56,479 --> 00:58:57,900
- Come on! 
- All right, all right, let's do it!

1006
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:00,348
Come on, guys!
Come on, hustle, hustle!

1007
00:59:00,383 --> 00:59:03,318
<i>23 seconds left. You could cut
the tension with a sword.</i>

1008
00:59:03,352 --> 00:59:04,653
<i>The long ball
is played into Jay.</i>

1009
00:59:04,687 --> 00:59:07,489
<i>Jay, great jump, great leap.</i>

1010
00:59:07,523 --> 00:59:09,424
<i>And a great move by Jay.</i>

1011
00:59:09,459 --> 00:59:10,592
Big block from Chad.

1012
00:59:10,626 --> 00:59:13,328
<i>Jay dishes off to prince Ben.</i>

1013
00:59:13,362 --> 00:59:15,664
And then Carlos
with a big block, goes down.

1014
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:18,700
<i>Jay through the kill zone,
picks up Carlos.</i>

1015
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:21,336
<i>Oh, he's being hammered by
dragon fire. Still, going on.</i>

1016
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:24,339
<i>Jay, hurdling maneuver at
mid-field. He's in the clear.</i>

1017
00:59:24,373 --> 00:59:25,674
<i>The ball goes back to Jay.</i>

1018
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:27,409
- Hey, Jay!
- Carlos?

1019
00:59:27,443 --> 00:59:29,277
Go up!

1020
00:59:29,312 --> 00:59:30,512
Ben!

1021
00:59:30,546 --> 00:59:31,713
<i>He passes to prince Ben.</i>

1022
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:33,315
<i>He scores!</i>

1023
00:59:37,353 --> 00:59:38,687
Prince Ben has won it!

1024
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:41,723
<i>What an unselfish play by Jay!</i>

1025
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:45,393
<i>What a team! Incredible!</i>

1026
00:59:45,428 --> 00:59:48,530
<i>And it's the new guys,
Jay and Carlos,</i>

1027
00:59:48,564 --> 00:59:50,599
<i>who set up the prince
for the win here.</i>

1028
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:54,436
What a victory!
An absolutely wonderful end

1029
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:57,339
<i>to one of the best games ever.</i>

1030
00:59:57,373 --> 00:59:59,541
Here they come, folks. The
winners of the first tourn...

1031
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:03,311
Excuse me. Excuse me. Can I
have your attention, please?

1032
01:00:08,651 --> 01:00:10,385
There's something
I'd like to say.

1033
01:00:19,395 --> 01:00:22,397
- Give me an "M"!
- "M"!

1034
01:00:23,533 --> 01:00:26,535
- Give me an "A"!
- "A"!

1035
01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:28,703
- Give me an "L"!
- "L"!

1036
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,441
- What does that spell?
- Mal!

1037
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:35,710
- Come on, I can't hear you!
- Mal!

1038
01:00:35,745 --> 01:00:38,346
I love you, Mal!
Did I mention that?

1039
01:00:38,381 --> 01:00:41,750
Oh...

1040
01:00:41,784 --> 01:00:45,999
- Give me a beat! Whoo!

Did I mention that?

- Chad's my boyfriend now!
- Hey!

1098
01:03:23,479 --> 01:03:25,413
And I'm going
to the coronation with him.

1099
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:28,316
So I don't need
your pity date.

1100
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:30,719
Whoa! Mal! Will you go to
the coronation with me?

1101
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:34,689
- Yes!
- She said yes!

1102
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:37,592
Let's go, Ben.

1103
01:03:37,626 --> 01:03:39,527
The whole team's
waiting for you.

1104
01:03:39,562 --> 01:03:40,795
- Yeah.
- Bye.

1105
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:44,799
Whoo!

1106
01:03:44,834 --> 01:03:46,334
<i>What a victory.</i>

1107
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:48,503
<i>What a day
for the Auradon Knights,</i>

1108
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:51,539
<i>finally winning back the
trophy after so many years.</i>

1109
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:54,842
- I feel really sorry for Audrey.
- You do?

1110
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:57,512
Yeah.

1111
01:03:57,546 --> 01:03:59,647
I feel like if she
were talented like you,

1112
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:03,418
and she knew how
to sew and knew beauty tips,

1113
01:04:03,452 --> 01:04:06,213
that she wouldn't need a prince to
make her feel better about herself.

1114
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:08,690
I guess I am
kind of talented.

1115
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,759
You are definitely gifted.

1116
01:04:10,793 --> 01:04:12,960
- Thanks, M.
- Yeah, yeah!

1117
01:04:13,595 --> 01:04:15,597
<i>And there he is.</i>

1118
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:17,766
<i>Jay, the most valuable player.</i>

1119
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,668
<i>How do you like that?</i>

1120
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:23,000
Hey!

1121
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:30,999
Looking for something?

1122
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:37,385
Thank you, Chad.

1123
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:41,356
It's gratifying to see someone
still respects the honor code.

1124
01:04:42,558 --> 01:04:45,527
It will be my recommendation
that you are expelled.

1125
01:04:45,561 --> 01:04:47,462
- Mr. Delay, I...
- But that isn't fair.

1126
01:04:47,496 --> 01:04:49,497
Obviously she wasn't cheating
since she didn't have that...

1127
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:51,633
- Whatever it is.
- It's called a magic mir...

1128
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:54,536
You're not helping. Stop. Maybe
she needed another pencil.

1129
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:57,505
- Actually, I was...
- Really, don't help.

1130
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,574
- Please.
- Please.

1131
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:01,100
Well, if you can
pass this test,

1132
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:03,999
I'll return your property
and let the matter drop.

1133
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:23,665
For the first time, it's like I'm
more than just a pretty face.

1134
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:25,667
A shocker, huh?

1135
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:29,337
You were pretty
great in there.

1136
01:05:29,371 --> 01:05:32,340
So were you.

1137
01:05:32,374 --> 01:05:35,443
I bet I can get an "A" on the
next test without the mirror.

1138
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:37,779
Yeah. Well, maybe we can get
together and we'll hang out with...

1139
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,315
- Yeah, let's get together.
- There you are!

1140
01:05:40,349 --> 01:05:42,518
I have been looking for you
literally everywhere! 

677
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:43,518
What's wrong?

1141
01:05:43,552 --> 01:05:45,800
Ben just asked me out on...

1142
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:50,625
- ...a date.
- Nice.

1143
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:53,728
- We can handle this. Bye.
- Bye.

1144
01:05:53,762 --> 01:05:56,231
- You're looking a little pale.
- Yeah, of course.

1145
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:58,600
I can fix that with some
gloss and some blush.

887
01:05:57,465 --> 01:05:58,000
No!

1146
01:05:58,634 --> 01:06:01,336
- Mal, I can use the...
- No, no, no.

1147
01:06:12,381 --> 01:06:14,999
Okay. Easy on the blush.

1148
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,800
I don't want to scare him away.

1149
01:06:17,118 --> 01:06:18,800
Not that I could.

1150
01:06:18,801 --> 01:06:22,423
Please. My mom taught me how to
apply blush before I could talk.

1151
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:25,326
Always use upward strokes.

1152
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:31,533
My mom was never really big
on makeup tips.

1153
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:34,435
- I never had a sister.
- Well, now you do.

1154
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:37,500
We're going to need all the family
we can get if we don't pull this off.

1155
01:06:37,501 --> 01:06:40,275
My mother's not a barrel of laughs
when she doesn't get her way.

1156
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:41,999
Just ask Snow White.

1157
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:46,347
- Are you afraid of her?
- Sometimes.

1158
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:49,484
Are you afraid of your mom?

1159
01:06:49,518 --> 01:06:53,421
I just really want her
to be proud of me.

1160
01:06:53,455 --> 01:06:57,091
She gets so angry with me
when I disappoint her.

1161
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:03,064
And sh... yeah, she's my mom,
so I know she loves me...

1162
01:07:03,098 --> 01:07:05,266
In her own way.

1163
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:09,700
Moving on. Come see.

1164
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:11,372
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

1165
01:07:17,999 --> 01:07:20,281
- Oh.
- I know.

1166
01:07:20,316 --> 01:07:23,418
- I look...
- Say it.

1167
01:07:23,452 --> 01:07:28,089
- Not hideous.
- Not even close.

1168
01:07:42,504 --> 01:07:44,700
For the first time,
I understand the difference

1169
01:07:44,701 --> 01:07:46,700
between pretty and beautiful.

1170
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,900
I hope you like bikes.

1171
01:08:26,515 --> 01:08:30,251
Tell me something about yourself
that you've never told anyone.

1172
01:08:30,286 --> 01:08:35,056
Um...
My middle name is Bertha.

1173
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:37,458
- Bertha?
- Yeah.

1174
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:38,800
Bertha.

1111
01:08:38,801 --> 01:08:40,800
Just my mom doing
what she does best.

1175
01:08:40,801 --> 01:08:45,067
Being really, really evil.
Mal Bertha.

1176
01:08:46,901 --> 01:08:49,837
- Mine's Florian.
- Florian?

1177
01:08:49,871 --> 01:08:52,140
- Yeah.
- How princely.

1178
01:08:52,174 --> 01:08:53,300
Oh, that's almost worse.

1555
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:55,176
I mean, you know,
it's better than Bertha.

1179
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:58,513
But it's still not...
Watch your foot. Yeah.

1180
01:08:58,547 --> 01:09:00,900
- Are you good?
- Mm-hmm.

1181
01:09:00,901 --> 01:09:03,151
Now, step up.
There you go.

1182
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:07,999
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1183
01:09:09,258 --> 01:09:10,458
Open.

1184
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:20,201
Go on.

1185
01:09:26,175 --> 01:09:28,242
Mm...

1186
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:32,347
- Is this your first time?
- Mm...

1187
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:37,990
We don't really date
much on the island.

1188
01:09:37,991 --> 01:09:41,990
It's more like...
Gang activity.

1189
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:43,999
Um, I meant,

1190
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,194
is this your first time
eating a jelly donut?

1191
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:48,600
Is it bad?

1192
01:09:48,999 --> 01:09:50,700
You got a...

1193
01:09:50,701 --> 01:09:52,166
Just a...

1194
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:54,999
- I mean, yeah, do this.
- Mm-hmm.

1195
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:56,537
Gone?

1196
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:59,307
You can't take me
anywhere, I guess.

1197
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:02,243
You know, I've done all
the talking. Your turn.

1198
01:10:02,277 --> 01:10:05,346
I really don't know
that much about you.

1199
01:10:05,381 --> 01:10:07,700
Tell me something.

1200
01:10:09,451 --> 01:10:13,221
Well, I'm 16.

1201
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:15,400
I'm an only child.

1202
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:18,100
And I've only ever
lived in one place.

1203
01:10:18,101 --> 01:10:20,400
Me, too. That... We have
so much in common already.

1204
01:10:20,401 --> 01:10:24,298
No. Trust me, we do not.

1205
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:28,600
And now you're
gonna be king.

1206
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,444
- Yeah.
- What?

1207
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:35,999
A crown doesn't
make you a king.

1208
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,247
Well, it kind of does.

1209
01:10:39,281 --> 01:10:42,216
No, it...

1210
01:10:42,251 --> 01:10:44,500
Your mother
is mistress of evil

1211
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,155
and I've got the poster parents
for goodness.

1212
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:51,325
But we're not
automatically like them.

1213
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,462
We get to choose
who we're gonna be.

1214
01:10:54,496 --> 01:10:57,198
And right now,

1215
01:10:57,232 --> 01:11:00,535
I can look into your eyes and
I can tell you're not evil.

1216
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,999
I can see it.

1217
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:10,800
- Let's go for a swim.
- Hm? What? Uh...

1218
01:11:10,801 --> 01:11:12,313
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

1219
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,500
I think I'm just gonna
stay here.

1220
01:11:14,501 --> 01:11:15,700
No, no, no. Come on.

1221
01:11:15,701 --> 01:11:17,200
I think I'm gonna stay behind

1222
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:18,286
and try a strawberry.

1223
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,850
I've literally never tried
a strawberry before.

1224
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,258
Mm! Mm...

1225
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:26,999
Don't eat all of them.

1226
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,095
Okay.

1227
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:31,000
Ooh!

1228
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,534
Mm.

1229
01:11:47,382 --> 01:11:50,500
Are those little crowns
on your shorts?

1230
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,487
Maybe.

1231
01:11:59,228 --> 01:12:03,397

Ben?

1266
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:35,116
Ben!

1267
01:14:55,303 --> 01:14:58,506
Ugh!

1268
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,274
You scared me!

1269
01:15:00,308 --> 01:15:02,309
- You... you can't swim?
- No!

1270
01:15:02,344 --> 01:15:04,280
You live on an island!

1111
01:15:04,281 --> 01:15:06,280
Yeah, with a barrier around it, 
remember?

1271
01:15:06,314 --> 01:15:07,350
Ugh!

1234
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:09,350
And you still tried
to save me.

1272
01:15:09,999 --> 01:15:12,666
Yeah. And do you
thank me? No!

1273
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,089
All I get is soaking wet!

1274
01:15:15,123 --> 01:15:19,393
And, uh, this fancy rock.

1275
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:22,063
It's yours.

1276
01:15:22,097 --> 01:15:24,131
Make a wish and throw it
back in the lake.

1277
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:33,374
What...

1278
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:55,262
Uh, Mal...

1279
01:15:55,297 --> 01:15:57,500
I told you that I loved you.

1280
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,503
What about you?

1281
01:16:04,306 --> 01:16:06,507
Do you love me?

1282
01:16:16,351 --> 01:16:19,053
I don't know
what love feels like.

1283
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:31,365
Maybe I can teach you.

1284
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:42,109
Children, excuse me.

1285
01:16:42,144 --> 01:16:44,245
Um, as you know, uh,

1286
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:47,800
this Sunday is family day
here at Auradon prep.

1287
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,085
And because your parents
can't be here due to,

1288
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:53,420
uh, distance,

1289
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:57,358
we've arranged
for a special treat.

1290
01:17:02,264 --> 01:17:05,900
I don't see anything,
nor do I hear.

1291
01:17:05,999 --> 01:17:07,334
- Kids!
<i>- Is it...</i>

1292
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:10,203
- Is it... is...
- Press enter.

1293
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:12,900
Can I please see a remote?
Is this thing on?

1294
01:17:12,901 --> 01:17:14,300
- Ugh, it's broken.
- Ugh!

1295
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:15,576
I hate electronic equip...

1296
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:19,700
- Oh!
- Evie, it's mommy. Oh!

1297
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:23,050
Look how beautiful.
Oh, you know what they say,

1298
01:17:23,084 --> 01:17:25,319
the poison apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

1299
01:17:25,353 --> 01:17:29,800
- Don't you mean the weeds?
- Ooh! Who's the old bat?

1300
01:17:29,801 --> 01:17:32,092
This is fairy godmother.

1301
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:35,062
Still doing tricks
with eggplants?

1302
01:17:35,096 --> 01:17:38,500
I turned a pumpkin
into a beautiful carriage.

1303
01:17:38,501 --> 01:17:42,900
You really couldn't give Cinderella
till one a.m.? I mean, really.

1304
01:17:42,901 --> 01:17:46,207
What, the hamsters had to be
back on their little wheels?

1305
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:49,800
They were mice! They were
not... they were mice.

1306
01:17:49,801 --> 01:17:51,278
- They were not... 
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

1307
01:17:51,313 --> 01:17:53,080
- They were mice.
- Hi, Mom.

1308
01:17:53,114 --> 01:17:54,500
Mal!

1309
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:57,318
I m-m-miss you.

1310
01:17:57,352 --> 01:17:59,800
You children are never
far from our thoughts.

1311
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:00,354
I got it.

1312
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:03,100
How long must mommy
wait to see you?

1313
01:18:03,101 --> 01:18:05,000
Um, there's a big coronation
coming up.

1314
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:07,900
I think sometime probably
sometime after... that.

1315
01:18:07,901 --> 01:18:10,364
- When?
- Friday, 10 a.m.

1316
01:18:10,498 --> 01:18:12,600
You sure I can't
see you before that?

1317
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:16,800
I don't know what I'll do if I don't
get my hands on that magic wan...

1318
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:20,800
You... you little nugget
that I love so much.

1319
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,177
Yes, I completely
understand, Mother.

1320
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:26,999
Carlos, is that a dog?

1321
01:18:28,116 --> 01:18:31,200
Oh, yes, yes,
baby, I do understand.

1322
01:18:31,201 --> 01:18:33,999
It would make the perfect
size for earmuffs.

1323
01:18:34,721 --> 01:18:36,700
He's the perfect size
for a pet.

1324
01:18:36,701 --> 01:18:37,526
Oh!

4345
01:18:37,527 --> 01:18:40,400
This dog loves me,
and I love him.

1325
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:43,130
- And FYI, your dog is stuffed!
- Oh!

1326
01:18:43,164 --> 01:18:48,068
- So give it a rest!
- Oh-ho! Burn!

1327
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:51,600
Oh! Why don't you go sell
a toaster, you two-bit salesman!

1328
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:54,400
People who talk to stuffed
animals shouldn't throw stones.

1329
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:57,077
<i>Oh, well, people who sell toasters
shouldn't use mixed metaphors.</i>

1330
01:18:57,112 --> 01:18:58,345
Enough!

1331
01:18:59,999 --> 01:19:02,548
I'm so sorry.

1332
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:06,020
- Thanks for the special treat.
- Of course.

1333
01:19:10,258 --> 01:19:12,393
M?

1334
01:19:12,427 --> 01:19:14,400
What do you think our parents
are gonna do to us

1335
01:19:14,401 --> 01:19:17,031
if we don't pull this off?

1336
01:19:17,065 --> 01:19:21,700
I think they will be
quietly disappointed in us,

1337
01:19:21,701 --> 01:19:24,104
but ultimately...

1338
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:26,373
Proud of us
for doing our best.

1339
01:19:26,408 --> 01:19:28,042
Really?

1340
01:19:28,076 --> 01:19:30,477
No, I think we
are definitely goners.

1341
01:19:30,512 --> 01:19:32,379
Yeah.

1342
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,285
Okay, we all know
what this looks like.

1343
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,300
So it'll be up on the dais
under the beast's spell jar,

1344
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:42,900
and we'll be
coming in from here.

1345
01:19:42,901 --> 01:19:44,458
I will be in the very front.

1346
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:46,200
You all will be up
in the balcony.

1347
01:19:46,201 --> 01:19:47,394
- Okay.
- Carlos?

1348
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:50,297
Okay, so I'll find our limo,
so we can break the barrier,

1349
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:52,600
and, uh, get back on the
island with the wand.

1350
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:55,069
- Perfect. Evie?
- Yeah?

1351
01:19:55,103 --> 01:19:56,990
You will use this
to take out the driver.

1352
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:58,800
Two sprays and he'll
be out like a light.

1353
01:19:58,999 --> 01:19:59,999
Okay.

1354
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,221
M?

1355
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:16,500
You wanna break
Ben's love spell?

1356
01:20:18,559 --> 01:20:20,260
Yeah.

1357
01:20:20,295 --> 01:20:22,096
You know, for after.

1358
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:23,564
I don't...

1359
01:20:26,301 --> 01:20:28,502
I've just been thinking,

1360
01:20:28,536 --> 01:20:31,105
you know, when the villains
finally do invade Auradon,

1361
01:20:31,139 --> 01:20:33,507
and begin to loot

1362
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:35,442
and kick everyone
out of their castles

1363
01:20:35,477 --> 01:20:38,112
and imprison their leaders

1364
01:20:38,146 --> 01:20:40,600
and destroy all that is
good and beautiful,

1365
01:20:40,601 --> 01:20:44,151
Ben still being in love with me
just seems a little extra...

1366
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:47,999
...cruel.

1367
01:20:53,528 --> 01:20:55,329

Mm.

1414
01:23:57,478 --> 01:24:00,147
- Just here?
- Ready?

1415
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,800
Oh, by the way,
I have a new girlfriend.

1416
01:24:03,801 --> 01:24:05,219
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1417
01:24:05,253 --> 01:24:06,700
Well, I never
wanted to say anything,

1418
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:09,089
but I always thought that Audrey
was a little self-absorbed.

1419
01:24:09,123 --> 01:24:11,400
A fake smile,
kind of a kiss-up.

1420
01:24:11,401 --> 01:24:12,800
Do we know your
new girlfriend?

1421
01:24:12,801 --> 01:24:15,500
On the count of three.
One, two...

1422
01:24:15,501 --> 01:24:16,800
Well, sort of. Mal!

1423
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:19,099
I gotta go, okay?

1424
01:24:19,133 --> 01:24:20,700
- Three!
- Huh?

1425
01:24:23,137 --> 01:24:25,600
- Mal? Mal.
- Uh...

1426
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,600
I wanna introduce
you to my parents.

1427
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:30,400
Ben.

1428
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,500
This is Mal.
From the island.

1429
01:24:35,501 --> 01:24:37,400
- Mm...
- My girlfriend.

1430
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

1431
01:24:41,222 --> 01:24:43,489
I was thinking maybe
she can join us for lunch.

1432
01:24:43,523 --> 01:24:44,800
Of... course.

1433
01:24:44,801 --> 01:24:46,525
Any friend of Ben's...

1434
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,999
Um, I actually came
with my friends.

1435
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,999
Well, you should invite them.

1436
01:24:52,567 --> 01:24:56,400
- Because the more the merrier!
- Yeah, I'll go grab them.

1437
01:24:56,401 --> 01:24:58,600
Uh, how about a game
of croquet before lunch?

1438
01:24:58,601 --> 01:25:00,400
- Huh? Of course.
- Game on.

1439
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:02,442
Game on.

1440
01:25:02,477 --> 01:25:04,100
- Have you played before?
- No.

1441
01:25:04,101 --> 01:25:05,245
No? You'll be fine.

1442
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,247
Whoa.

1443
01:25:07,282 --> 01:25:08,415
Come on, dude.

1444
01:25:08,449 --> 01:25:10,150
- Here, stand up.
- Come on, dude.

1445
01:25:10,184 --> 01:25:11,218
Stand here.

1446
01:25:11,252 --> 01:25:12,900
Hey, get them!
Hey, get them!

1447
01:25:12,901 --> 01:25:14,221
Nice!

1448
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,225
- Hello there.
- Hi.

1449
01:25:18,259 --> 01:25:21,261
Now, have we met?

1450
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:24,100
No, I don't think so.
I'm new.

1451
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:25,999
I'm sort of like a...
Transfer student.

1452
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,600
- Oh, yes.
- Grammy.

1453
01:25:27,601 --> 01:25:30,900
Oh, Audrey!
Give grammy a kiss, dear.

1454
01:25:32,273 --> 01:25:35,375
- "Grammy"?
- Sleeping beauty's mother.

1455
01:25:37,145 --> 01:25:39,300
Grammy, I don't think you want
to be talking to this girl.

1456
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,349
Unless you feel like taking
another hundred-year nap.

1457
01:25:42,383 --> 01:25:43,700
What?

1458
01:25:46,287 --> 01:25:47,900
You!

1459
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:54,600
How are you here?

1460
01:25:55,196 --> 01:25:58,600
And how have you
stayed so young?

1461
01:25:58,232 --> 01:26:01,600
Queen Leah, it's okay. Maleficent
is still on the island.

1462
01:26:01,601 --> 01:26:03,136
This is her daughter, Mal.

1463
01:26:03,171 --> 01:26:05,990
Don't you remember my proclamation
to give the new generation a chance?

1464
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:09,200
A chance to what, Ben?
Destroy us?

1465
01:26:10,278 --> 01:26:12,700
Come on.
You remember, don't you?

1466
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:16,400
The poison apples.
And the spells.

1467
01:26:17,285 --> 01:26:18,700
Spells.

1468
01:26:19,554 --> 01:26:22,189
My daughter...

1469
01:26:22,223 --> 01:26:24,257
Was raised by fairies

1470
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:27,327
because of
your mother's curse.

1471
01:26:27,362 --> 01:26:31,164
So her first words,
her first steps,

1472
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:34,400
I missed it all!

1473
01:26:37,171 --> 01:26:39,072
- You mustn't trust her.
- I'm so so...

1474
01:26:39,107 --> 01:26:40,700
Go away! Stay away from her!

1475
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:44,144
- Don't do this, Chad.
- What?

1476
01:26:44,178 --> 01:26:46,400
They were raised
by their parents, Ben.

1477
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:48,800
What do you think villains
teach their kids? Huh?

1478
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:52,219
Kindness? Fair play?
No way, okay? Uh-uh.

1479
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:54,500
You stole another
girl's boyfriend.

1480
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,425
- Hey, hey!
- Oh. You enjoy hurting people.

1481
01:26:58,459 --> 01:27:04,030
And you, you're nothing but
a gold digger and a cheater.

1482
01:27:04,065 --> 01:27:05,800
Mirror, mirror, in my hand,

1483
01:27:05,801 --> 01:27:08,600
who's the biggest
jerk in the land?

1484
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:10,404
What? Come on!

1485
01:27:10,438 --> 01:27:12,239
Back off, Chad. All right?

1486
01:27:12,273 --> 01:27:14,274
- Back off!
- Chad!

1487
01:27:14,308 --> 01:27:17,600
Chad? Chad!
Evie did something to Chad!

1488
01:27:17,601 --> 01:27:19,446
- Wake up.
- Check if he's okay.

1489
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,249
Come on, Mal.

1490
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:24,317
- Guys!
- Jay!

1491
01:27:24,352 --> 01:27:26,100
Chad, wake up!

1492
01:27:27,555 --> 01:27:29,089
Come on, Chad.

1493
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,400
I feared something
like this would happen.

1494
01:27:34,401 --> 01:27:37,500
- This isn't their fault!
- No, son.

1495
01:27:38,232 --> 01:27:39,600
It's yours.

1496
01:27:44,272 --> 01:27:46,106
Mom?

1497
01:27:54,315 --> 01:27:58,151
What happened?
I had this dream...

1498
01:28:12,066 --> 01:28:14,800
Hey, guys.
How is everyone?

1499
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,037
Yeah?

1500
01:28:17,071 --> 01:28:19,600
Hey, listen.
Forget about it. All right?

1501
01:28:19,601 --> 01:28:22,242
It was nothing.
Forget about it. Let it go.

1502
01:28:22,276 --> 01:28:25,250
Tomorrow, after the coronation, I
promise everything will be okay.

1503
01:28:27,348 --> 01:28:28,800
I have to go.

1504
01:28:31,419 --> 01:28:32,452
I'll see you guys later.

1505
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,160
Listen, Evie, I wanna talk about
earlier today. I just...

1234
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:39,560
Doug!

1506
01:28:40,194 --> 01:28:41,495
- It's my fault, Doug. I'm sorry.
- No, it's mine.

1507
01:28:41,529 --> 01:28:43,330
- Doug!
- What?

1508
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:48,235
- Doug...
- Sorry, I can't.

1509
01:28:48,269 --> 01:28:51,204
Okay.

1510
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:54,074
How long does she
think that's gonna last?

1511
01:28:54,108 --> 01:28:57,444
Mal is just the bad girl infatuation.
Yeah.

1512
01:28:57,478 --> 01:29:00,700
I mean, he's never gonna
make a villain a queen.

1513
01:29:06,087 --> 01:29:10,056
Beware, forswear,
undo Jane's hair.

1514
01:29:13,528 --> 01:29:15,495
Ew!

1515
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:17,900
There's a lot more
where that came from.

1516
01:29:17,901 --> 01:29:19,600
Excuse me,
who do you think you are?

1517
01:29:19,601 --> 01:29:21,467
Do I look like I'm kidding?

1518
01:29:30,278 --> 01:29:32,700
I'm really looking
forward to tomorrow.

1519
01:29:34,415 --> 01:29:37,600
Let's grab that wand

01:31:12,763 --> 01:31:14,897
- I have something for you.
- For me?

1542
01:31:14,932 --> 01:31:15,932
Yeah.

1543
01:31:15,966 --> 01:31:17,833
It's just for later, you know,

1544
01:31:17,868 --> 01:31:19,802
when you need strength.

1545
01:31:19,836 --> 01:31:21,704
Some carbs
to keep up your energy.

1546
01:31:21,738 --> 01:31:23,706
Always thinking.

1547
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:25,875
But I can't wait.

1548
01:31:25,909 --> 01:31:28,678
- No!
- Mm. Mm...

1549
01:31:28,712 --> 01:31:29,946
Mm! This is really good.

1550
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:32,882
- Uh, do you...
- Mal?

1551
01:31:32,916 --> 01:31:35,618
- Do you feel okay?
- You bet.

1552
01:31:35,652 --> 01:31:39,689
Would you say that
you're still in... that...

1553
01:31:39,723 --> 01:31:42,725
That you have very strong
feelings for me?

1554
01:31:42,759 --> 01:31:43,826
I'm not sure.

1555
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:46,300
I mean, let's give
the anti-love potion

1556
01:31:46,301 --> 01:31:47,697
a few minutes to take effect.

1557
01:31:47,731 --> 01:31:49,699
- Yeah...
- Okay.

1558
01:31:51,034 --> 01:31:52,735
What?

1559
01:31:52,769 --> 01:31:54,604
What? You knew?

1560
01:31:54,638 --> 01:31:57,100
That you spelled me? Yeah.

1561
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,300
- Yeah, I knew.
- I'm... I can explain myself.

1562
01:31:59,301 --> 01:32:02,645
No, look, it's fine. I mean, you had
a crush on me. I was with Audrey.

1563
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:03,946
You didn't trust that it
could happen on its own.

1564
01:32:03,981 --> 01:32:06,716
- Am I right?
- Yes.

1565
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,517
You're so right.

1566
01:32:09,953 --> 01:32:11,687
So, then,
how long have you known?

1567
01:32:11,722 --> 01:32:13,756
Since our first date.

1568
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:15,758
Your spell washed away
in the enchanted lake.

1569
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:19,729
So then what?
You've just been...

1570
01:32:19,763 --> 01:32:21,497
Faking it since then?

1571
01:32:29,806 --> 01:32:31,941
I haven't been
faking anything.

1572
01:32:47,691 --> 01:32:50,626
- Well, if it isn't...
- My daughter.

1573
01:32:50,661 --> 01:32:53,529
- Looking like some kind of...
- Princess!

1574
01:32:53,563 --> 01:32:56,866
<i>Now, let's see
who this beauty is wearing.</i>

1575
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:00,603
- Evie.
- Evie! That's my dau... Evie!

1576
01:33:00,637 --> 01:33:03,773
Someone named Evie
designed her gown.

1577
01:33:03,807 --> 01:33:06,200
- That's my daughter!
- Oh, wow. She sewed a dress.

1578
01:33:06,201 --> 01:33:07,677
Meanwhile,
my girl duped a prince,

1579
01:33:07,711 --> 01:33:09,478
and she's this close
to grabbing the magic wand.

1580
01:33:09,513 --> 01:33:11,614
Bitter, party of one.
Bitter, party of one.

1581
01:33:11,648 --> 01:33:12,848
It's happening, people!

1582
01:33:12,883 --> 01:33:15,618
It's happening!
I say, gird your loins!

1583
01:33:15,652 --> 01:33:17,586
Gird your loins!

1584
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:19,789
Villains,
our revenge begins today.

1585
01:33:36,573 --> 01:33:38,574
About the other day,
I just...

1586
01:33:38,608 --> 01:33:40,710
I told Ben this
wasn't going to be easy.

1587
01:33:40,744 --> 01:33:42,845
You also taught me that a king
has to believe in himself.

1588
01:33:42,879 --> 01:33:44,914
- Even when it isn't easy.
- I did?

1589
01:33:44,948 --> 01:33:48,951
I... how very wise of me.

1590
01:33:48,985 --> 01:33:52,688
Ben, we are very
proud of you.

1591
01:33:52,723 --> 01:33:55,200
- You keep listening to your heart.
- Thanks, Mom.

1592
01:33:57,728 --> 01:33:59,300
You're gonna make
a fine king.

1593
01:34:10,507 --> 01:34:12,842
Wish me luck.

1594
01:35:20,544 --> 01:35:22,545
Don't blow it, kiddo.

1595
01:36:11,928 --> 01:36:13,200
Do you solemnly swear

1596
01:36:13,201 --> 01:36:14,803
to govern the peoples
of Auradon

1597
01:36:14,831 --> 01:36:19,200
with justice and mercy
as long as you shall reign?

1598
01:36:20,737 --> 01:36:22,638
Oh, grab the thing already!

1599
01:36:22,672 --> 01:36:25,300
I do solemnly swear.

1600
01:36:26,843 --> 01:36:30,646
Then it is my honor and my joy

1601
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,882
to bless our new king.

1602
01:36:34,584 --> 01:36:36,652
- Yes!
- Oh!

1603
01:36:36,686 --> 01:36:38,487
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1604
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,729
Oh!

1605
01:36:50,967 --> 01:36:54,670
The barrier is broken!
We're free!

1606
01:36:57,007 --> 01:37:01,777
Scepter! Now!

1607
01:37:12,589 --> 01:37:13,789
Child, what are you doing?!

1608
01:37:13,823 --> 01:37:16,200
If you won't make me beautiful,
I'll do it myself!

1609
01:37:17,494 --> 01:37:19,862
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

1610
01:37:19,896 --> 01:37:21,764
Take cover!

1611
01:37:24,734 --> 01:37:26,769
Careful, Mal!

1612
01:37:34,544 --> 01:37:37,200
- Mal, give me the wand.
- Stand back.

1613
01:37:38,815 --> 01:37:41,583
- It's okay.
- Ben, I said stand back!

1614
01:37:41,618 --> 01:37:43,886
I told you so!

1615
01:37:45,989 --> 01:37:47,723
- Let's go!
- Revenge time.

1616
01:37:47,757 --> 01:37:51,560
- You really want to do this?
- We have no choice, Ben!

1617
01:37:51,594 --> 01:37:54,663
- Our parents...
- Your parents made their choice.

1618
01:37:54,698 --> 01:37:56,498
Now you make yours.

1619
01:38:07,677 --> 01:38:09,478
I think I want to be good.

1620
01:38:09,512 --> 01:38:11,580
- You are good.
- How do you know that?

1621
01:38:11,614 --> 01:38:13,482
Because...

1622
01:38:13,516 --> 01:38:15,200
Because I'm listening
to my heart.

1623
01:38:20,757 --> 01:38:22,925
I want to listen
to my heart, too.

1624
01:38:26,896 --> 01:38:30,699
And my heart is telling me
that we are not our parents.

1625
01:38:32,502 --> 01:38:36,538
I mean, stealing things
doesn't make you happy.

1626
01:38:36,573 --> 01:38:39,742
Tourney and victory pizza
with the team makes you happy.

1627
01:38:39,776 --> 01:38:41,543
Yeah!

1628
01:38:41,578 --> 01:38:44,947
And you, scratching dude's
belly makes you happy.

1629
01:38:44,981 --> 01:38:46,882
Who would've thought?

1630
01:38:48,818 --> 01:38:50,753
And Evie...

1631
01:38:50,787 --> 01:38:53,555
You do not have to play dumb
to get a guy.

1632
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:56,792
You are so smart.

1633
01:38:56,826 --> 01:38:59,828
And I don't want to take
over the world with evil.

1634
01:38:59,863 --> 01:39:02,798
It doesn't make me happy.

1635
01:39:02,832 --> 01:39:04,700
I want to go to school.

1636
01:39:07,637 --> 01:39:09,400
And be with Ben.

1637
01:39:11,574 --> 01:39:14,877
Because Ben makes me
really happy.

1638
01:39:19,482 --> 01:39:22,600
Us being friends
makes me really happy.

1639
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:25,754
Not destroying things.

1640
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:31,560
I choose good, you guys.

1641
01:39:38,668 --> 01:39:40,836
I choose good, too.

1642
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:46,875
I choose good.

1643
01:39:47,977 --> 01:39:50,846
So, just to be clear,

1644
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,715
we don't have to be worried
about how really mad

1645
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:55,918
our parents will be?

1646
01:39:55,952 --> 01:39:58,620
Because they're gonna
be really, really mad.

1647
01:39:58,655 --> 01:40:00,556
Your parents
can't reach you here.

1648
01:40:03,793 --> 01:40:07,500
Okay, then. Good.

1649
01:40:09,833 --> 01:40:11,800
Come on.

1650
01:40:32,822 --> 01:40:36,500
- I'm back!
- It can't be.

1651
01:40:36,993 --> 01:40:38,861
Go away, Mother.

1652
01:40:38,895 --> 01:40:42,598
She's funny.
Oh!

1653
01:40:42,632 --> 01:40:46,802
I'm so... You're very funny.
Here.

1654
01:40:46,836 --> 01:40:48,637
Wand me. Chop chop.

1655
01:40:48,671 --> 01:40:50,873
No!

1656
01:40:50,907 --> 01:40:53,642
- Bibbidi-bobbidi...
- Boo.

1657
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:04,820
Psych.

1658
01:41:04,854 --> 01:41:07,923
Ooh.

1659
01:41:07,957 --> 01:41:11,727
Ooh, in another time,
in another time.

1660
01:41:11,761 --> 01:41:16,498
♪ Evil like me,
don't you wanna be mean... ♪

1661
01:41:16,533 --> 01:41:17,733
Ow!

1662
01:41:17,767 --> 01:41:19,100
Oh. Oh, no.

1663
01:41:19,101 --> 01:41:23,705
Someone needs to pluck
their nose hairs.

1664
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:26,642
Where shall we begin?

1665
01:41:26,676 --> 01:41:28,610
I know.

1666
01:41:28,645 --> 01:41:31,400
Why don't we start
by getting rid of this?

1667
01:41:32,715 --> 01:41:34,716
Perfect fit!

1668
01:41:35,451 --> 01:41:37,719
Oh, excuse me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

1669
01:41:37,754 --> 01:41:38,854
The horns, the horns!

1670
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:42,200
Aw...

1671
01:41:42,201 --> 01:41:43,892
Falling in love is weak...

1672
01:41:45,795 --> 01:41:47,963
And ridiculous.

1673
01:41:47,997 --> 01:41:51,200
- It's not what you want.
- You don't know what I want!

1674
01:41:52,769 --> 01:41:57,700
Mom, have you ever once
asked me what I want?

1675
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:59,875
- I'm not you!
- Oh, obviously.

1676
01:41:59,909 --> 01:42:01,843
I've had years and years
and years and...

1677
01:42:01,878 --> 01:42:04,746
Years of practice being evil.
You'll get there.

1678
01:42:04,781 --> 01:42:06,300
No, I will not.

1679
01:42:07,584 --> 01:42:09,551
And I really wish that you

1680
01:42:09,586 --> 01:42:11,587
had never gotten
there yourself.

1681
01:42:12,956 --> 01:42:17,759
Love is not weak
or ridiculous.

1682
01:42:17,794 --> 01:42:19,928
It's actually really amazing.

1683
01:42:19,963 --> 01:42:22,631
I know one thing,
young lady.

1684
01:42:22,665 --> 01:42:24,900
You have no room for love
in your life!

1685
01:42:26,769 --> 01:42:28,904
And now I command,
wand to my hand!

1686
01:42:31,941 --> 01:42:34,843
Ha! It worked!

1687
01:42:34,877 --> 01:42:38,780
I hardly think so. Frankly, this
is tedious and very immature.

1688
01:42:38,815 --> 01:42:40,649
Give me the wand.
Give me the wand!

1689
01:42:40,683 --> 01:42:43,619
Hold on, Mal. Maybe good really
is more powerful than evil.

1690
01:42:43,653 --> 01:42:46,999
Oh, please!
You're killing me. Arf!

1691
01:42:48,756 --> 01:42:50,759
Oh! Oh, the breath!

1692
01:42:50,793 --> 01:42:53,064
The breath! Get off me!

1693
01:42:57,698 --> 01:42:59,768
Gaston should be jealous.

1694
01:43:02,203 --> 01:43:03,905
Enough!

1695
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:09,478
You all will regret this!

1696
01:43:20,623 --> 01:43:22,658
Come on.
Run, Jay, run!

1697
01:43:29,532 --> 01:43:30,966
Hurry, Jay.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1698
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,868
- Jay!
- Watch it, Jay!

1699
01:43:32,902 --> 01:43:36,638
Jay, come on!
Please, Jay! Jay!

1700
01:43:36,673 --> 01:43:38,707
Aah!

1701
01:43:38,741 --> 01:43:40,909
Magic mirror,
show your bright light!

1702
01:43:44,847 --> 01:43:47,649
Behind me, E!
Leave my friends alone!

1703
01:43:49,986 --> 01:43:52,621
This is between
you and me, Mother.

1704
01:43:55,825 --> 01:43:58,860
The strength of evil
is good as none,

1705
01:43:58,895 --> 01:44:00,962
when stands before
four hearts as one.

1706
01:44:00,997 --> 01:44:04,800
The strength of evil
is good as none,

1707
01:44:04,834 --> 01:44:07,636
when stands before
four hearts as one.

1708
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:09,938
The strength of evil
is good as none,

1709
01:44:09,972 --> 01:44:13,675
when stands before
four hearts as one!

1710
01:44:29,992 --> 01:44:32,527
Oh!

1711
01:44:34,931 --> 01:44:36,765
- What just happened?
- I have no idea.

1712
01:44:36,799 --> 01:44:37,899
- Did you do it?
- I don't know.

1713
01:44:37,934 --> 01:44:40,736
No, no, no, no.
Your mother did.

1714
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:43,972
She shrank to the size
of the love in her heart.

1715
01:44:44,006 --> 01:44:46,742
That's why it's so itty-bitty.

1716
01:44:46,776 --> 01:44:48,977
Is she gonna
be like that forever?

1717
01:44:49,011 --> 01:44:51,880
Well, forever is a long time.

1718
01:44:51,914 --> 01:44:54,616
You learned to love.

1719
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:56,300
So can she.

1720
01:44:58,554 --> 01:45:00,300
I believe this belongs to you.

1721
01:45:01,824 --> 01:45:04,826
And I believe this...

1722
01:45:04,861 --> 01:45:06,661
Belongs to you.

1723
01:45:08,965 --> 01:45:12,567
You all have earned yourselves
an "A" in goodness class.

1724
01:45:14,537 --> 01:45:17,739
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

1725
01:45:17,774 --> 01:45:20,642
Okay, okay! Oh!

1726
01:45:20,676 --> 01:45:22,477
We kinda got this
all wrapped up here.

1727
01:45:22,512 --> 01:45:25,547
- Oh...
- Yeah, let's go.

1728
01:45:28,718 --> 01:45:31,820
Oh!

1729
01:45:31,854 --> 01:45:35,690
- Next time, I rescue you, okay?
- Yeah.

1730
01:45:35,725 --> 01:45:37,526
Let's not let there
be a next time, okay?

1731
01:45:44,567 --> 01:45:46,300
I will be right back.

1732
01:45:48,871 --> 01:45:50,405
I love you.

1733
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:52,874
But you are on
a major time-out.

1734
01:45:52,909 --> 01:45:55,844
Don't be too hard on Jane.

1735
01:45:55,878 --> 01:45:59,848
I was the one who put all
that crazy stuff in her head.

1736
01:46:02,618 --> 01:46:05,300
You are beautiful...

1737
01:46:06,589 --> 01:46:08,758
Inside and out.

1738
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,400
Your mom got that right.

1739
01:46:11,901 --> 01:46:13,200
I guess
I did get pretty lucky

1740
01:46:13,201 --> 01:46:17,599
- in the mother department.
- Yeah, I guess so.

1741
01:46:30,913 --> 01:46:32,781
- Hey!
- Help!

1742
01:46:33,815 --> 01:46:35,617
Careful!

1743
01:46:35,651 --> 01:46:37,000
