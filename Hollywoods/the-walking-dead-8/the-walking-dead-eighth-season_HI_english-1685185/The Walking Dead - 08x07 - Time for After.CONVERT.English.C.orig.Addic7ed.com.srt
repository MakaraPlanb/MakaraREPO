1
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:16,767
Previously on AMC's
"The Walking Dead"...

2
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:18,635
I need to see the Sanctuary.

3
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:19,669
We both do.

4
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,304
We got a lot more work to do.

5
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:26,943
One of our own did this...
is doing this, right now.

6
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:33,483
You need to see Dr. Carson 2.0 A.S.A.P.

7
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:34,484
I do.

8
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:36,953
Your choice... is to forget Negan,

9
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,555
switch sides again.

10
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:40,315
No.

11
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:46,923
It's not too late for you.

12
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:49,442
My offer still stands.

13
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:53,129
You can join us...

14
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:54,956
or you can die.

15
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,710
Turn.

16
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:53,506
Why? Why the pictures?

17
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:56,565
Sculpt you, after.

18
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,241
- After what?
- After.

00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:19,157
_

21
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:43,613
I'm well-aware you're
the fifth columner.

22
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:47,379
Green duffel, red paint, workers' guns.

23
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:51,173
Doesn't require Turing-grade decryption

24
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,178
to grok the truth
that you're the traitor

25
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:54,773
creeping and colluding with AHK.

26
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:57,679
It's an acronym I've concocted...

27
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,281
Alexandria, Hilltop, Kingdom.

28
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:00,622
I considered going with KAH,

29
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:02,344
but it remains a hair too onomatopoeic.

30
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,675
I've been charged by no
less than Negan himself

31
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,786
with... cracking the very calamity

32
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:10,081
you more than likely had
a heavy hand in creating.

33
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:15,984
So I need you to cease and desist

34
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:18,288
all betrayals and backstabbery,

35
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:20,950
fronting and Judas-ness A.S.A.P.

36
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:25,901
In exchange, I offer to keep what I know

37
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:28,003
from Negan and the others.

38
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:49,788
The Saviors are finished.

39
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,851
Negan's finished.

40
00:05:55,518 --> 00:05:57,050
And this place...

41
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,296
what it's been...

42
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,804
that's all over.

43
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:07,109
Food and water's runnin'
low, workers are angry,

44
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:09,286
the Saviors, they're gettin' scared.

45
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,413
And this place is gonna fall,

46
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,728
and all you have to do
to be on the winning side

47
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:17,219
is to stand down.

48
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:20,262
All you have to do is nothing.

49
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:21,667
Wait.

50
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:24,272
Let it play out.

51
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:26,479
Can you do that?

52
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:34,629
You've seen what happens here...

53
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,091
heard the screams...

54
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,299
smelled the burning skin.

55
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:48,037
You don't got blood on your hands yet,

56
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:50,149
but that's comin'.

57
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:55,157
Once you do those things,
you become those things,

58
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:57,008
and there's no goin' back.

59
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,773
No forgettin' it.

60
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,705
What cranks my shaft is bein' safe.

61
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:09,169
And here... me bein' safe

62
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:11,309
means a whole lot of
other people are safe.

63
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:13,876
I think about that a great deal.

64
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:27,623
Yes, I'm Negan...

65
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:33,808
and it ain't perfect,
but we are Saviors.

66
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,836
We save.

67
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,120
Like I said...

68
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,213
your cloak-and-dagger's on the Q.T.

69
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,819
All I ask is that you do
nothin' that results in harm

70
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:58,220
to anyone inside these walls,

71
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,055
and it'll stay that way.

72
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:35,955
What do you think?

73
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,095
A day.

74
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,130
Maybe two.

75
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:57,880
Eugene.

76
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,782
I could use a little help.
Can you come in?

77
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:05,801
He's getting worse.

78
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,920
It's an infection.

79
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,571
Maybe more than one.

80
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:15,698
It's attacking his organs.

81
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,866
It's only a matter of
time until one fails.

82
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:19,902
- Just wish we had some damn meds.
- Mm.

83
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:21,737
I wish he hadn't assisted

84
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:24,035
in the ill-conceived
caper to trap us in here.

85
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:26,508
I also wish for Razzles,

86
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:28,761
but if wishes were
horses and all that...

87
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:32,514
- What, you think this is his fault?
- It is.

88
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,816
Not the whole of it,

89
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:35,505
but he was a member of the campaign.

90
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:38,320
I do get it...

91
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:40,656
but I shan't forget it.

92
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:44,093
- Would you sit with him?
- How's that?

93
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:45,728
I'm gonna head to the marketplace,

94
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:47,529
see if they have any herbs down there,

95
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:49,178
try some Eastern medicine on him.

96
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,701
He shouldn't be alone.
And he's your friend.

97
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:54,282
Traveling companion.

98
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:56,572
Okay. Do you want him to die?

99
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,498
No.

100
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,467
I'll be back soon.

101
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:25,292
Sit.

102
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:28,219
You look worse than me.

103
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,073
Mm.

104
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,299
I don't appreciate that,

105
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:34,837
because you look like a
potato and shit casserole.

106
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:39,062
Sit.

107
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:25,947
Are you gonna help me get
Dr. Carson out of here?

108
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:29,431
Given that this building
is currently surrounded

109
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:31,172
by a Wilkes-Barre of walkers,

110
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:34,837
I don't see an escape attempt...
without putting to use

111
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:36,638
the same flawed technique of innards

112
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:39,208
which landed you in your
status-quo piss-poor condition.

113
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,568
What you may have
forgotten in your request

114
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:43,936
is that I am a small person

115
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,704
who does not stick his neck out

116
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,378
for anyone other than himself.

117
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,708
I stick firmly within my lane

118
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:52,231
without any need for a
signal, hand or automatic.

119
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:56,831
All I want is for you
to do the right thing.

120
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:59,636
And what is said definition on that?

121
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:02,348
Can't say I ever sussed it out.

122
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:05,324
Right for some can be
downright horrific for others,

123
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,737
and knowing that has kept me vertical

124
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:08,332
when so many have gone horizontal.

125
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:14,174
It requires faith, trusting yourself.

126
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:20,205
Believing that God is inside of you...

127
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,507
guiding you...

128
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:26,639
and knowing that he has
a plan for all of us.

129
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,947
Is that so hard?

130
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,222
It's absurd.

131
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,359
Is it?

132
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,074
You're a man of science...

133
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:42,161
who not too long ago...
would've found it

134
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:45,415
impossible to believe
that the dead could walk.

135
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:51,336
So maybe...

136
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:54,640
maybe it's not impossible to believe

137
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:58,644
that you will know
what the right thing is

138
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,612
when the time comes.

139
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:02,728
And then...

140
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:09,188
you will... you'll act.

141
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,826
Got something.

142
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:43,197
Looked like a truck, but I
lost visual from the water tower.

143
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,415
It's one of ours.

144
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:11,917
Tanya, hello.

145
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:14,543
You said a week. It's been a week.

146
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:19,670
Our deal? My boombox?

147
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:23,340
- Well, yes, I mean...
- Did you fix it?

148
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:26,710
A-Are you serious?

149
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,078
Yeah.

150
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:29,700
Well, it's not ready.

151
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:31,478
Our neck is in the
noose of the deceased,

152
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,212
and it is tightening
with every ticktock.

153
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:36,058
Are you... not distressed
that we're trapped?

154
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:38,759
I was already trapped here.

155
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,324
You've got until tomorrow, Eugene,

156
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,101
and then we renegotiate.

157
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,095
Wait.

158
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:50,467
Would it be possible to take
possession of the second bottle

159
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:52,519
despite the delivery delinquency?

160
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:56,039
The deal was one bottle up front

161
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:58,038
and one bottle after you fix it.

162
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,365
I need it.

163
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:06,249
You making it into
jet fuel or something?

164
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:10,487
I've taken to throwing 1.5 fluid
ounces down my gullet most P.M.s

165
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:12,089
as a necessary requirement

166
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:14,384
to catching some
increasingly elusive Z's.

167
00:15:17,228 --> 00:15:19,596
Ergo, I need the giggle juice.

168
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:33,897
I get it.

169
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:36,418
I need help sleeping, too.

170
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:37,918
I don't get it.

171
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:39,750
Yes, you do.

172
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:42,285
You help them, Eugene.

173
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:43,839
You help him.

174
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,616
I tried to stop this.

175
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,361
Me and Frankie, we came to you,

176
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:52,729
and we asked you for your help.

177
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:56,733
You could've changed this
place into something else,

178
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,201
something better.

179
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,437
But you took care of you,

180
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:03,467
and now you've got to live with that.

181
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,477
I hope this helps.

182
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:09,546
But it won't.

183
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:14,946
Negan wants you.

184
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:22,759
Our people are gonna
be at the Sanctuary soon,

185
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:24,327
asking for their surrender.

186
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,398
We're almost there.

187
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:29,156
That's why we do it.

188
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,937
We make it happen.

189
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:34,060
So we cover you with crossfire
from the upper windows,

190
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:36,573
you crash the truck into the walkers

191
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:37,766
and through to the building.

192
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,310
Yep, crack it open, Savior buffet.

193
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:43,980
You know the workers will
make it away, up the stairs?

194
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:46,427
They're on the other side of the
building. They should make it.

195
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:47,651
You sure?

196
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:48,919
After we do this,

197
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,420
their only choice is to give up.

198
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:52,823
It's risky. They could
see the truck comin'.

199
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,591
There weren't any more weapons

200
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:56,193
at the Saviors' warehouse, right?

201
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:58,094
No more rockets for the RPG's.

202
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,518
- We work with what we got.
- You got me.

203
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:05,335
Other snipers, too.

204
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:08,035
Saviors see you comin',
we got you covered,

205
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,359
whatever it takes.

206
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:11,875
I want it done.

207
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:14,277
I want them done.

208
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:16,479
Good.

209
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:18,002
So, we doin' this or what?

210
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:20,458
W-Why don't we just wait
it out like we planned?

211
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:23,453
Michonne's right.

212
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:25,466
What you're talking about is
risky. Things could go bad.

213
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,734
The truck with the speakers

214
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,892
almost took all those walkers away.

215
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:30,160
It almost did go bad.

216
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:31,461
Something else could.

217
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:34,051
Even if it don't, we don't got 
the Kingdom fighters no more.

218
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,044
I mean, if the Saviors
want to put up a fight,

219
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:38,057
we don't got the numbers
to make 'em surrender.

220
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:40,070
That's why Rick's
talking to the Scavengers.

221
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:42,239
You got shot. They lied to us.

222
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:44,936
- You... You believe 'em now?
- I believe in Rick Grimes.

223
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,377
I could've done something...

224
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,145
sooner, to end this.

225
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:52,048
I knew about those weapons at Oceanside,

226
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:53,162
and I waited.

227
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:56,186
I didn't do shit about it.

228
00:17:56,547 --> 00:17:57,880
With or without you,

229
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:00,223
I'm not letting that happen again.

230
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:01,916
Then it's without me.

231
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,201
I'm out.

232
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,532
We got some cars parked
near the east-side lookout.

233
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,685
You can take one and go home.

234
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:21,578
You staying?

235
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,014
You good with all this?

236
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,531
I helped get this started.

237
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:28,222
Got to see it through.

238
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:32,079
You think it's easier
to come out here and risk

239
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:34,531
than to stay back there and wait.

240
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:37,827
And I get it... I used
to believe that, too.

241
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:41,111
Thing is sometimes,
you just have to wait.

242
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:43,629
Sometimes you don't get to know.

243
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:45,547
I just wish it didn't take

244
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:47,602
seeing Sasha walk out of
that coffin to realize it.

245
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:55,912
Come on. Let's go.

246
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:23,224
If things don't get fixed soon,

247
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,287
a lot of people are gonna die.

248
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,525
My people.

249
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,775
Not me, of course.

250
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:32,148
I'm livin' no matter what.

251
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:33,950
I am too good at this shit.

252
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:35,352
But others...

253
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,739
I can't have that.

254
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:41,271
I don't want to see people
get shot up, chewed up,

255
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:42,454
and chewing up the rest.

256
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:45,703
I don't want to see
you get eaten, Eugene.

257
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:51,386
This place,

258
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:56,698
it's about pooling and
organizing strength.

259
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:00,439
And you...

260
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,642
my friend, are strong.

261
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,201
That spongy organ between your
eyes and your spectacular mullet

262
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,475
is strong,

263
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,889
and I just want to make
sure that you know...

264
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:18,123
that I know that.

265
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:20,959
Consider me made.

266
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:25,288
Our pages are utterly and
completely one and the same.

267
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,367
Eugene...

268
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,569
I was going for a handshake.

269
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:54,125
Stand up.

270
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:00,920
Now, I can see where you'd be confused,

271
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,189
as I rarely do that shit.

272
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:06,308
A handshake is a sign of mutual respect.

273
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:10,864
Not many people get that from me.

274
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:19,539
There's work that needs getting to.

275
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:27,400
Hey, cut that engine.

276
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:30,578
Any closer, you'll draw
walkers from the yard.

277
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:44,932
Here.

278
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:52,258
You take fire from the
windows, we fire back.

279
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:57,947
Come on.

280
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,466
There's a spot for cover by the chutes.

281
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,089
You up for this?

282
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:17,600
I came here 'cause I wanted
to see things for myself.

283
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:22,113
I wanted to know that
things were gonna work.

284
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:24,941
But you know what?

285
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:28,789
I don't get to know that.

286
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,694
None of us do.

287
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:35,027
What I do know is that
things are working now.

288
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,083
So maybe...

289
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:39,885
we just need to trust

290
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:42,087
that things are gonna keep working,

291
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:44,408
because this...

292
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,093
what we're about to do...

293
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:51,135
it's not worth risking us.

294
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,701
It is for me.

295
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,105
Just is.

296
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:08,548
I hope it works.

297
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:13,191
I-I really, really do,
but I-I can't do it.

298
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,532
I just can't.

299
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:26,532
Then you shouldn't.

300
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:01,791
We got Morgan and the snipers.

301
00:26:02,202 --> 00:26:03,602
We can do this.

302
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:06,117
Yeah.

303
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,720
We will.

304
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:27,066
Audio recording for transcription.

305
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,192
Emergency operations
manual, first entry.

306
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,909
Countermeasure approach
for fence incursion.

307
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:37,549
High pop of undead, good 40,
50 deep to the former fence.

308
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:43,681
Note to accompany schematics for
audio glider emergency binder.

309
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,557
Audio glider activated for sound,

310
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:49,383
utilizing music as 96
decibel redirection,

311
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:53,121
drawing active deceased along
with it away from all exits,

312
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,341
allowing immediate free passage
for permanent redirection,

313
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,732
if successful.

314
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,768
Scratch the if...
when... When successful.

315
00:27:03,804 --> 00:27:05,236
Hell, yes.

316
00:27:09,592 --> 00:27:11,225
Don't turn around.

317
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:33,398
I'm here.

318
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:34,815
I'm ready.

319
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:39,828
South lookout... ready for go.

320
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:42,443
East lookout, ready.

321
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,078
North lookout, ready.

322
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:50,415
West lookout, ready.

323
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:58,630
Get up, back away from that thing.

324
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,430
Back away from it!

325
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,925
I'm attempting to save people, Dwight.

326
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,447
And killin' me is killin'
a great many innocents.

327
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:27,051
When this bird slips its surly bounds,

328
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:29,454
it's gonna Pied Piper
away their cold corpses

329
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:31,289
and... free this place.

330
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:34,937
And Negan will kill
Rick and Daryl and Rosita

331
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:36,494
and all your old friends.

332
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,697
They're former traveling
companions, nothing more.

333
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,735
I'm working with them

334
00:28:43,913 --> 00:28:47,369
to keep them and the people here alive.

335
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:49,943
We can get rid of Negan.

336
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,876
Just Negan.

337
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:54,879
And we're almost there.

338
00:28:56,608 --> 00:28:58,817
Negan ain't the dyin' type, Dwight.

339
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:02,420
- Oh, but you are, Eugene.
- I am.

340
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:05,602
That's exactly why I've not
yet stepped back, as it were.

341
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:10,819
By my reckoning, I have
two selects on facin' my fate.

342
00:29:11,846 --> 00:29:13,832
One, I abort launch on this glider,

343
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:15,333
don't free this place

344
00:29:15,368 --> 00:29:17,435
from the stranglehold
of cold teeth/tongues,

345
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,103
and Negan will likely execute me

346
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:21,366
as what he considers
to be a personal favor.

347
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:24,342
Or I could go for what's
behind door number two,

348
00:29:24,377 --> 00:29:25,910
take my chances being shot in the back

349
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:27,912
by a sometime-ally, despite any injury

350
00:29:27,948 --> 00:29:29,446
I may have caused in the past

351
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,485
by delivering a chomp
down on your chode.

352
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:03,648
Now!

353
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,888
Daryl, you're clear to the south.

354
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,746
You and Tara should head home.

355
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,124
Let's go! Move it! Let go!

356
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:44,516
Fall back! Move!

357
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,341
Move!

358
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:51,703
Fall back! Move! Move!

359
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,417
Move! Move!

360
00:32:57,163 --> 00:32:58,639
The answer is no!

361
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:01,373
I will never, not on your Nelly,
be on board with your plan.

362
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,278
Your invite is declined.

363
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,501
I will not end up like Sasha or you.

364
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,126
You both made your choices,

365
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,148
what I imagine most will
calculate as the right thing,

366
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,542
rolled your D20s and came up dead

367
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:12,933
and seemingly soon to be.

368
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,139
I cannot do the same.

369
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:16,872
Now, judge me if you choose,
but I'm seeing 20 for 20,

370
00:33:16,897 --> 00:33:19,041
I'm feeling 10 for 10,
I'm receiving 5 by 5

371
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,799
that staying safe means staying alive,

372
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:22,745
and I'm A-okay with
doing whatever it takes

373
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,013
to lock that down.

374
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:25,548
So I will obey Negan.

375
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,461
I will not cover for
anyone's U-turn on loyalties,

376
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:29,018
and I will damn well make sure

377
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:31,620
that Dr. Carson stays
cozy, comfy right here

378
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:33,861
in case I ever require
his healing expertise!

379
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,663
And I won't feel bad about it.

380
00:33:37,864 --> 00:33:40,064
Because I will survive.

381
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:42,481
It's in my biological imperative.

382
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:45,294
It's all I know how to do.

383
00:33:52,294 --> 00:33:54,913
It'll take an ass-load of ammo.

384
00:33:56,272 --> 00:33:57,711
It will.

385
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,475
Even with shot discipline
and P and Q minding.

386
00:34:02,186 --> 00:34:06,255
Can my bullet maker
fill my guns back up?

387
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:12,836
If you give my machines to
me or me to my machines...

388
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:16,699
that is an affirmative.

389
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:24,907
You do realize the storm of
shit I'm gonna dump on Rick

390
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:29,512
as soon as I am clear of the
shit storm he dumped on me.

391
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,680
I do, indeed.

392
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:33,983
Goddamn, Eugene.

393
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:36,285
How does it feel

394
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,287
to be the second-most
important person here?

395
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:42,427
How does it feel to
save these good people?

396
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,094
It feels great.

397
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,298
Got something else of urgency for you.

398
00:34:49,718 --> 00:34:51,434
Nother item solved.

399
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,102
More than a way out

400
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:55,320
and a promise of bullets on the way?

401
00:34:56,541 --> 00:35:02,144
Jesus, Eugene, you... are magnificent.

402
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,645
I am.

403
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,431
So, what is it?

404
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:10,971
Tell me.

405
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:15,524
What?

406
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,326
We have the stairs.

407
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:20,296
But the dead ones
have the lower level...

408
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:21,530
The whole thing.

409
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:22,727
Not much longer.

410
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,242
See, Eugene has solved
us a way out of this mess.

411
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:31,240
And... he actually says he has a topper.

412
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,071
Yeah?

413
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:43,052
I think I could fix the intercom system.

414
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:45,241
Which, uh...

415
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:49,363
would absolutely change the
face of communications here.

416
00:35:51,096 --> 00:35:52,707
That's it?

417
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:54,581
Sorry.

418
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:57,199
That kind of thing, uh...

419
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:58,942
well, cranks my shaft.

420
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,934
I'll leave you to the last action item.

421
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:34,902
Time for after.

422
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,808
Subdue!

423
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,622
I'm walking out now,

424
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:37,935
and me walking out means all of you die.

425
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:42,150
My people... There's a lot of them...

426
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:46,481
Won't attack today, but we will attack.

427
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:54,945
You can play your games,
draw your pictures,

428
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:59,162
sculpt whatever shit you
want, but I am leaving!

429
00:40:01,728 --> 00:40:03,402
After that...

430
00:40:04,284 --> 00:40:06,466
maybe you should just run.

431
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:27,547
We done?

432
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:30,718
Yes.

433
00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:46,647
Join you.

434
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:49,229
What then?

435
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,203
The Sanctuary is surrounded.

436
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:54,630
Walkers.

437
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:57,237
20 deep around the compound.

438
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:59,017
You'll come with me there...

439
00:40:59,972 --> 00:41:01,641
we'll wait till the others meet us.

440
00:41:01,677 --> 00:41:05,090
When they do, we'll ask the
lieutenants to surrender.

441
00:41:05,115 --> 00:41:07,339
All of us, together.

442
00:41:09,158 --> 00:41:12,547
Then I kill Negan, me alone.

443
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:18,725
We have a deal?

444
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:23,701
After, Saviors' things our things.

445
00:41:24,645 --> 00:41:26,304
Yes and yes.

446
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:28,268
It'll be all of ours.

447
00:41:28,303 --> 00:41:29,903
You'll get a fourth.

448
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:31,903
- Half.
- A fourth.

449
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:36,145
Fourth, and I sculpt you after.

450
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:39,479
Stand for me, those off.

451
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:43,850
These off, no sculpting.

452
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:48,204
My boots and my clothes now.

453
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,180
Fourth.

454
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:55,629
Fourth.

455
00:42:58,627 --> 00:43:02,262
Snipers, report in.

456
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,270
This is Rick Grimes.

457
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:12,140
Does anybody copy?

458
00:43:58,463 --> 00:44:03,068
