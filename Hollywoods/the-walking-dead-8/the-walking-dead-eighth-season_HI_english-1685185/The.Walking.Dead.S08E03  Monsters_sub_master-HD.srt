553
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:48,074
[Sobbing] He's there.

554
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:49,642
Eric's there.

555
00:34:49,677 --> 00:34:50,810
[Sniffles]

556
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:53,045
I can't...

557
00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:56,549
I can't...

558
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:59,118
I can't just let him...

559
00:34:59,154 --> 00:35:00,820
Aaron...

560
00:35:00,855 --> 00:35:03,256
that's not him.

561
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:04,724
[Sobbing]

562
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,959
Okay.

563
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:08,494
Oh!

564
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,929
Oh.
We gotta go.

565
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:11,964
No. No.

566
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,766
Come on.

567
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,492
Scott: Guns aren't here.

568
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,609
We gotta go right now, people!

569
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:31,511
They're gonna
pull away the herd,

570
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,413
but we aren't taking
any chances!

571
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:47,227
[Baby crying]

572
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:51,698
Tobin: She was inside?

573
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,633
She was.

574
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:55,253
[Engine starts]
I have a --

575
00:35:55,373 --> 00:35:57,465
I have a stop to make,
and Daryl's got his bike.

576
00:35:57,585 --> 00:36:00,440
Maybe she can go back
with you or Scott...

577
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:02,876
Aaron:
She can go with me.

578
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:10,484
I can, uh,
t-take her to the Hilltop.

579
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,986
She'll be safe there.

580
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:18,091
Aaron.

581
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:19,760
You sure?

582
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:22,229
Eric and I were gonna go up...

583
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:23,730
[Cries]

584
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:27,901
We were gonna go there after
and update Maggie.

585
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:33,273
So...that's what
I'm gonna do.

586
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:38,745
[Voice breaking] Please.

587
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,147
[Whispering] I have to.

588
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:42,349
Yeah.

589
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:49,189
Her name's Gracie.

590
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:52,926
[Vehicle doors close]

591
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,195
[Engine starts]

592
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,330
Hey, Gracie.

593
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:01,668
Daryl: See you back home.

594
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,336
Sure you wanna talk
to them assholes alone?

595
00:37:03,372 --> 00:37:05,305
[Grunts] Yeah.

596
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,873
That's how it gets done.

597
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:08,149
All right.
You're gone too long,

598
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:09,377
I'm gonna come lookin' for you.

599
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:11,178
That's the plan.
[Gunshots]

600
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,796
Hey!

601
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,732
Hey!

602
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:36,303
You're alone.

603
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,138
You got to be.

604
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,006
There's not enough room
for two of you

605
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:42,509
behind that tree.

606
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:44,477
And there's a herd coming.

607
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:48,915
I'm just sayin'.

608
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:50,851
Hey, I tell you what...

609
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:59,025
...we'll make you a deal.

610
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:03,363
You drop your gun
and come on out --

611
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:05,832
you tell us
what we need to know.

612
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,501
You do that,

613
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,769
you can take a car.

614
00:38:09,805 --> 00:38:11,771
You go. You live.

615
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:14,774
How about it?

616
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,445
Todd: [Voice breaking]
Why should I trust you?

617
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,749
'Cause I'm giving you my word.

618
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:26,853
There's not a lot
that's worth much these days,

619
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,689
but a man's word...

620
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,791
that's got to mean something,
right?

621
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,729
O-O-Okay.

622
00:38:49,778 --> 00:38:51,478
Todd:
W-What do you wanna know?

623
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:55,215
Rick: You ever have any

624
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,053
M2 Browning
.50-caliber guns here?

625
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,088
We did. For a while.

626
00:39:02,124 --> 00:39:03,823
What happened to 'em?

627
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:06,259
They got sent to
another outpost yesterday.

628
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:09,596
Which one?

629
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:11,097
It was Gavin's --

630
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,133
it's west of here.

631
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,043
Can I, uh --
Can...Can I go?

632
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:31,351
Which team's at Gavin's?

633
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:53,173
Everyone is accounted for,
Your Majesty.

634
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,144
Carol: Ezekiel?

635
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:02,782
Not one.

636
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:08,555
We need to sweep the compound.

637
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,558
Your counsel, your plan.

638
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:13,460
Let me take a look...

639
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,964
Alvaro: If we're gonna
be here a while,

640
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,066
might as well take care of them.

641
00:40:20,102 --> 00:40:22,168
We should do it either way, man.

642
00:40:32,914 --> 00:40:35,882
We or they.

643
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,717
One or the other.

644
00:40:37,753 --> 00:40:40,086
It cannot be --

645
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:44,090
Scatter, now!

646
00:40:44,126 --> 00:40:45,158
Cover the King!

647
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,260
[ Gunfire ]

648
00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:48,561
Ezekiel: No!
