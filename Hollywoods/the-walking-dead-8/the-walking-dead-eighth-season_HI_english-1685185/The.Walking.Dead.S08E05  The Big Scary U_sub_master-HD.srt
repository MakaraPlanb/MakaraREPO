1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,160
<i>Previously on amc's</i>
<i>"the walking dead"...</i>

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,750
The hilltop stands
with negan and the saviors.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,820
Aah!

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,230
We got the guns.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,470
I hope you got
your shittin' pants on.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,840
I might die.

7
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,650
I very likely will die.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,920
I'm not asking to live.

9
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,820
You've given me redemption,

10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,120
And it's that which makes me
no longer fear death.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,490
What I fear...

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,800
Is a fruitless death.

13
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,670
What I ask for...

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,340
After you have given me
so much...

15
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,610
Is purpose.

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,400
Wakey, wakey, eggs pancakey,
gregory.

17
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,800
No thank you?

18
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,340
No "yay!"?

19
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,270
These cakes are made
from scratch by yours truly.

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,440
I used genuine hilltop sorghum.

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,280
Milled it myself.

22
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,680
You... you... you did?

23
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,310
Uh-huh.

24
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,150
There is a lot of love
on this tray, gregory,

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,190
Because I wanted
to express love to you.

26
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,390
'Cause you did the right thing.

27
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,320
I told you if things started
to feel hinky at the hilltop

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,230
To come see me.

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,660
A-and I did.

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,160
With zero hesitation.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,300
Yes.

32
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,230
You went
to the satellite outpost

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,400
As I instructed.

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,370
Which was
incredibly impressive.

35
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,470
You told me that already.

36
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,470
I did?

37
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,010
Three times.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,380
Listen, you came to see me.

39
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,510
And though I was already away,

40
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,550
Dealing with that...
Rank betrayal,

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,860
Which was unknown to you...

42
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,560
Oh, indeed, it was unknown.

43
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,030
It was, indeed, unknown.

44
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,060
And you waited for me.

45
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,700
'Cause I wanted
to tell you about...

46
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,440
Well, hilltop and alexandria,
the kingdom.

47
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,270
But you were finding out
at that point

48
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,340
In alexandria, right?

49
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,510
Gregory, you don't need

50
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:56,420
To explain yourself
over and over again.

51
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,880
Hey.

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,690
Hear me when I say,

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,860
I'm telling you,
you did the right thing.

54
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,060
Every step of the way.

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,130
Why did you bring me here?

56
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,740
I brought you here

57
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,970
Because we now stand
on the precipice of greatness.

58
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,240
You said you could solve
the problem.

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,480
Today's the day, gregory.

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,350
You fill your belly up
with my love,

61
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,320
And then you solve it.

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,890
Aye, aye.

63
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,990
Ah.

64
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,460
Well, I, uh...

65
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,900
I'd just like to start by saying

66
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,170
Thank you
for having me here today.

67
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,810
Negan, let me lay this down
straight for you.

68
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,280
I know how it is...

69
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,350
Negotiating the slippery,
steep terrain

70
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,690
Of managing resources
and the population

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,290
And the big, scary you.

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,960
But you might know,
it's called the unknown.

73
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,970
Listen,
I-i mean it when I say it...

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,710
Negan, I don't like killing
people any more than you do.

75
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,770
I like killing people.

76
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,210
Oh.
Well, I...

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,380
I say it's about killing
the right people.

78
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,150
So, you kill the right people
at the right time...

79
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,160
Everything falls into place.

80
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,030
Everybody's happy.

81
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,300
Well, some people
more than others.

82
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,600
But you kill one,

83
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
And you could be saving
hundreds more.

84
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,880
And that is what
we are all about.

85
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,980
We save people.

86
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,750
That's...

87
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,220
That's why you're called
the... the saviors. Oh.

88
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,420
Gonna grab a smoke.

89
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,550
Now?

90
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,030
You don't want to hear this?

91
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,160
Don't need to.

92
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,400
Tell me where to go and what
to do, I'll make it happen.

93
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,440
Where were we, gregory?

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,410
Oh, that's right...

95
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,250
You were telling me that
you don't like to kill people,

96
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,720
And I was saying that I do...
under the right circumstances.

97
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,590
Well, this...
this situation

98
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,120
That we...
we find ourselves in,

99
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,360
This... this conflict...

100
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,560
I can stop it
before it even gets started.

101
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,030
I mean, here it is.

102
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,070
I go to my people,
and I... i tell them

103
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,770
If... if you're joining
with this...

104
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,310
This misled crusade,

105
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,480
You're no longer
citizens of the hilltop.

106
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,980
You're out on your asses.

107
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,480
You're still their guy?

108
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,560
They still listen to you,
gregory?

109
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,130
Can you exile people?

110
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,660
The hilltop is my house.

111
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,230
I'm still the guy.

112
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,730
I've always been the guy.

113
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,470
Huh.

114
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,000
If you're still the guy,

115
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,810
If, indeed,
you have always been the guy,

116
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,340
Then why the hell
didn't you know about the widow

117
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,610
Leading an army of your people

118
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,820
Straight up my ass
in alexandria?

119
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,530
You know what I think, gregory?

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,340
I think you're playing
both sides.

121
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,340
I think you are
a thin-dicked politician

122
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,640
Threading the needle
with your thin, thin dick.

123
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,710
Now, is listening to you
the right way to go,

124
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,590
Or is it the right place
and time for something else?

125
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,460
No, no.
Not trying to do that.

126
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,890
No, not...

127
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,730
I was... wasn't aware
of things

128
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,230
Until they were already in...
in motion.

129
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,170
N-no hesitation.

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,740
Allegiance, right there,
the whole thing.

131
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,870
I just... i-i didn't know until
I-i knew, you know?

132
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,080
Gregory, hey.

133
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,810
I believe you.

134
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,420
Now make negan
believe you, huh?

135
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,590
Hmm?

136
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,760
The hilltop is mine.

137
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,070
I let a fox into my hen house.

138
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,610
She and her people took
advantage of my generous nature.

139
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,110
I see that now,
and I will fix it.

140
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,220
If we go in
with the right stage picture,

141
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,350
A thick and veiny show of force

142
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,020
Surrounding gregory
when he lays down the law,

143
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,930
I think things go back
to copacetic.

144
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,030
If they don't,
we take a flyer on the place

145
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,370
And kill everyone there.

146
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,640
Unfortunate play,

147
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,440
But the other communities
will get the message,

148
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,640
And we achieve equilibrium.

149
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,980
Plan a.

150
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,080
Plan b...

151
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,650
People are a resource.

152
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,120
Money on the table.

153
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,160
People are the foundation

154
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,770
Of what we are building here!

155
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,580
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

156
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,790
Are you confused
about who we are?

157
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,690
Are you confused
about who is in charge?

158
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,630
Are we backsliding, simon?

159
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,700
Please,
tell me we're not backsliding.

160
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,880
We're not backsliding.

161
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:07,680
This is a pronounced event
and a fragile moment.

162
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,020
Hell, yes, it is.

163
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,060
We need to win it all.

164
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
Plan a

165
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,700
Is taking the rick, the widow,
and king assface alive

166
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,240
And making them dead

167
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,910
In a very, very public
and instructive way.

168
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,050
We kill the right people
in the wrongest way possible,

169
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,850
And we make them all watch!

170
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,200
Should we get
our people out there?

171
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,200
Line 'em up, light 'em up?

172
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,840
No.

173
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,040
They got some sort
of hillbilly armor.

174
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,010
We'd just be wasting metal
on metal.

175
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,110
And the rpg is stashed
at the cache, so...

176
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,380
Let's have ourselves
a little chat.

177
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,590
Simon, bring your new
little friend.

178
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,190
We may need him to say
some words.

179
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,390
Gregory, you're on deck.

180
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,800
Gary, put three and three
in the windows.

181
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,930
Tell them to stay the hell down
till we need them.

182
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,540
Well, shit.

183
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,040
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,040
Jesus christ.

185
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,280
I was in a meeting.

186
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,140
Well, that's handy.

187
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,980
This one still has a full clip.

188
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,720
There wasn't any point
in firing it.

189
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,490
I didn't have enough.

190
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,320
Yeah, but you could've gone down
fighting, you big baby.

191
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,190
I'm just pulling your dick,

192
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,560
Breakin' your balls
a little bit.

193
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,230
You done good.
Smart play.

194
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,170
Let's get you properly
on your ass.

195
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,150
Your friend rick is an asshole.

196
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,290
You're an asshole.

197
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,990
Yeah.

198
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,860
I am.

199
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,600
But he's gonna
get people killed.

200
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,200
By you.

201
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,170
See, I killed the widow's
husband and the ginger.

202
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,840
But I didn't <i>get</i> them killed.

203
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,540
That was your boy rick.

204
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,110
Big difference.

205
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,390
You know, I saw you stop
for that gregory idiot.

206
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,360
You were there.
You saw the whole thing.

207
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,500
You heard his little speech.

208
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,600
Why would you stop
for that bearded prick?

209
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,010
What I fear
is a fruitless death.

210
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,950
Jesus christ.
You got to be kiddin' me.

211
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,250
He split
on your creepy little ass.

212
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,890
The point of your life would
be saving that dickhead?

213
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,120
That wouldn't be it.

214
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,930
There had to be some reason
I did what I did.

215
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,340
Maybe this is the reason.

216
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,410
What?

217
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,980
I think...

218
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,750
I'm here to take
your confession.

219
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:08,780
Your people
back in the chemical plant...

220
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
Did you win?

221
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,330
No one did.

222
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,730
The hell's
that supposed to mean?

223
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,870
The hell's
that supposed to mean?

224
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,380
Everyone's dead.

225
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,810
Bullshit.

226
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,520
There's no one else?
You're the only one?

227
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,650
Me.

228
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,490
The king.

229
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,230
The axe man.

230
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,530
And a short-haired psycho lady.

231
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,200
You did this.

232
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,200
My people...

233
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,580
Your people...

234
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,180
They're all gone.

235
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,620
Damn.

236
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,530
And now... Me, too.

237
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,490
We can wait it out
a little bit,

238
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,890
See if my people
can figure something out.

239
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,830
One thing
that is sure as ass...

240
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,960
If my people think I'm dead...

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,470
A lot of folks are gonna die
in there.

242
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,070
Why?

243
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,640
Listen to me.

244
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,610
I don't have shit to confess.

245
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,480
Except maybe the fact
that I rubbed one out

246
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,820
Right where you're sitting
just to calm down a bit.

247
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,890
Let me ask you something.

248
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,530
Why'd you become a priest?

249
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,140
I love god, and I love people.

250
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,040
I wanted
to bring them together.

251
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,310
To help people through
their difficult times.

252
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,310
To help them through
their weaknesses.

253
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,110
Well, look at that.

254
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,050
That's my thing.

255
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,850
I like to help people
through their weaknesses, too.

256
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,520
Been doing it one way or another
my whole life.

257
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,960
How do you help people?

258
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,730
You want to know why people
are gonna start dying in there?

259
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,300
Because I'm not there
to stop it.

260
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,490
We have to assume negan's dead.

261
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,400
I'm negan.

262
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,670
And as I understand it,
everyone in this room is.

263
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,070
Now, I realize there's a lot
of stress in the air,

264
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,540
But just to clarify,

265
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,610
Are you saying
you're someone else, regina?

266
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,410
No.

267
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,340
Good.

268
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,350
We should send
the fence crew out.

269
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,180
Grab a few others,

270
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,420
We get 40 workers,
standing back to back.

271
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,520
No.
We get them out with pipes,

272
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,660
They clear a path...

273
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,630
Just enough
for a small team...
inadequate.

274
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,800
What?

275
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,470
The numbers you suggest
aren't adequate.

276
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,810
Given the current sro density
of the herd surrounding us,

277
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,810
40 workers armed with
melee weapons in the
formation you propose

278
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,280
Would be overcome,
closed in on,

279
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,040
And macked upon
within a few minutes.

280
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,750
Yeah.
That's right.

281
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,780
We use the workers
as a distraction

282
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,950
To get a small team
past the herd.

283
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,620
They can warn the outposts

284
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,420
And then come back
with the fat lady.

285
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,560
Add to the approach's
slim chances of success,

286
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,960
It's likely the play would lead
to widespread unrest,

287
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,660
Pitting the workers
against the soldiers

288
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,330
When we're running
out of food and fuel,

289
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,200
Upsetting our already precarious
apple cart.

290
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,940
Maybe all we need to do
is put you out there, eugene.

291
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,180
Maybe it would motivate
the answer man

292
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,350
To come up with a solution.

293
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,120
Regina, he's right.

294
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,990
The workers have the numbers,

295
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,120
And we need to keep them
on our side.

296
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,460
We need to keep them in line.

297
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:24,100
Even if we get a few of ours out
and somehow clear the crowd,

298
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,170
They have snipers
all around the building.

299
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,170
So right now, let's deal
with the other part.

300
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,140
Someone in here made
everything out there happen.

301
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,480
We're having our little
crisis-management meeting

302
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,120
About the rebellion
in alexandria,

303
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,150
Us three outpost heads,

304
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,150
And that's when they pile
this crap on us?

305
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,960
That's when they cut us off?

306
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,890
Come on.

307
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,500
They knows all and sees all.

308
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:00,530
Sometimes it doesn't take
a gun.

309
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,970
The right kind of rat...

310
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:09,180
Can kill plenty of people
with just some talk.

311
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,010
But it's not gonna be us,

312
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,720
And it doesn't have
to be the workers.

313
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,420
Dwight,
you got to face reality here.

314
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,190
No, simon, we keep what's ours,

315
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,660
And we don't give up
a damn thing.

316
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,260
We get out.

317
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,360
And I don't want to hear
backbiting

318
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,660
Or pissing or moaning
from you two.

319
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,700
You got a problem with that,
come at me.

320
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,400
Hmm?

321
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,070
You can't lead the saviors
out of here, I will.

322
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,570
Yes, my boy.

323
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Yes!

324
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,240
And...

325
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,610
We're gonna find that subhuman
coward that did this to us,

326
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,180
And we're gonna kill him

327
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,250
Very slowly
in front of everyone here

328
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,750
Over the course
of a few very long days.

329
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,070
Good meeting, people.

330
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,400
Now let's make today
the best today it can be.

331
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,750
I'd like to express
my sincere thanks

332
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,620
For your support
at the recent confab.

333
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,260
I was doing my level best
to stay fully on the dl,

334
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,630
But sometimes the mouth-brain
neuronal connection experience

335
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,230
Is a misfire, and foot met mouth
at an unavoidable velocity.

336
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,730
You were right in there.

337
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,170
If you didn't say it,
I would've.

338
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,670
As a token of my appreciation,

339
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,270
I brought you some primo cukes
from my private stash.

340
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,140
I'd like you to accept these
as a sign of my faith

341
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,480
That we will, in fact,
find a way out of this pickle.

342
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,710
Pun intended.

343
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,280
Thanks for stopping by.

344
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,290
Hmm.

345
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,160
Hold up. It's...

346
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,490
It's still wet.

347
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,300
My apologies.

348
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,530
You diy'd these?

349
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,400
That's right.

350
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,810
Mm.

351
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,520
I fully understand
the reasoning

352
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,690
Behind yours truly being
prime suspect

353
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,490
In pretty much any
benedict arnold type situation.

354
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,130
And in light of that,

355
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,170
I'm doubly grateful
to have you watching my six.

356
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,470
You were right back there.

357
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,470
I didn't say
anything more than that.

358
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,120
You helped the weak
before this?

359
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,700
Kids.

360
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,700
You don't show them the way,

361
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,570
Well, they turn out
like garbage.

362
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,110
Little assholes
become great big ones,

363
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,570
So you show them the way.

364
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,780
Adults, they need it, too...

365
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,510
The government, laws,
religion, guilt.

366
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,550
People are weak.

367
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,190
Everyone?

368
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,550
Everyone.

369
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,290
You're weak.

370
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,790
Killing the innocent.

371
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,890
Right<i> and</i> goddamn wrong.

372
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm weak,
but me "killing the innocent"?

373
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,970
That ain't why, gabey.

374
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,050
We'll wait a little bit longer,

375
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,780
See if my people
can pull it together.

376
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,720
Why are you weak?

377
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,730
That's the wrong question.

378
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,060
It is<i> how</i> I am weak.

379
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,560
You see, the thing is,
I am also strong.

380
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,230
Everyone is a mix.

381
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,240
You can use your weaknesses
to drive your strength,

382
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,440
And obviously,
I am strong as shit.

383
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,540
I took this place,

384
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,080
And it was
a damn free-for-all...

385
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,080
A loose confederation
of assholes,

386
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,250
An army made up
of gangs of animals,

387
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,790
And I brought it all together.

388
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,230
The last guy that was in charge,
he wasn't in charge of shit.

389
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,690
He allowed people to be weak.

390
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,000
I don't.

391
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,970
I make them strong,
which makes this world strong.

392
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,200
You're gonna see, gabey.

393
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,810
See, I'm gonna make you
my new special project.

394
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,980
Gonna make you
nice and strong, too.

395
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,350
We're gonna find
your special purpose.

396
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,380
Hell yes, we are.

397
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,850
I'm strong.

398
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,290
I've killed.

399
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,790
I was at the satellite station.
I was a part of that.

400
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,460
Oh.

401
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,070
Then you killed my people
while they were sleeping.

402
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,370
Well, look at you,
swinging your dick.

403
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,010
Sure, gabe.

404
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,550
That's strong.

405
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,010
But that's not
what I'm talking about.

406
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,190
Tell me how you're weak.

407
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,530
We might be dead soon.

408
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,330
You may be dead.

409
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,830
Wouldn't you want to confess
before all that happens?

410
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,370
Wouldn't you want absolution
before that?

411
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,900
Forgiveness?

412
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,510
Costs you nothing more
than saying the truth aloud.

413
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,250
You don't think
you have anything to confess?

414
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,550
People you've killed?

415
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,620
I haven't killed
anyone that didn't need it.

416
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,360
The workers you treat
like slaves.

417
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,930
It's an economy.

418
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,860
Some people win,
some people lose,

419
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,200
But no one's a slave,
no one's going hungry,

420
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,470
And you couldn't say that
before all this.

421
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,770
Carl told us about your wives.

422
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:47,440
The women you pressure
into marrying you?

423
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,420
Every one of those ladies
made a choice.

424
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,390
Was there a first?

425
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,290
One before all of this?

426
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,600
A wife you promised
to have and to hold,

427
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,000
Forsaking all others?

428
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,800
One you told that lie to?

429
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,500
Lucille, give me strength.

430
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,820
All right, gabe!

431
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,190
No one's coming for us.

432
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,560
You took your shot... shots.

433
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,640
It's time to go.

434
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,800
Hey.
Give me a hand with this.

435
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,840
Yep.

436
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,840
Got it?
Yeah.

437
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,130
We can use these now.

438
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,760
What?

439
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,960
Well, think about it.

440
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,860
There ain't no kingdom no more.

441
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,600
Yeah.

442
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,340
We know what we got to do.

443
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,940
We blow open the sanctuary,
let the walkers flood in.

444
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,270
They'll surrender.

445
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,540
It'll be done.

446
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,680
Hell, we could end this
by sundown.

447
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,520
They have workers in there,
right?

448
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,220
Families, too.

449
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,790
Are there?

450
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,890
We'll hit the south side
of the main building.

451
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,660
The workers live
in the north side.

452
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,830
They'll be up the stairs
before the walkers even get in.

453
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,240
What if they don't?

454
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,540
There are people in there
who aren't fighters.

455
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,740
Doing this could change that.

456
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,910
Make them pick up guns
and stand by the saviors.

457
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,910
And if the saviors
don't surrender,

458
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,980
Maybe everyone fights us.

459
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,090
And we don't have
the kingdom anymore.

460
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,390
We're not doing this.

461
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,900
No.

462
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,070
<i>You</i> ain't doing this.

463
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,450
There's a plan,
and everyone's sticking to it.

464
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,350
Not everyone.

465
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,550
There's a lot of our people
that are dead, rick.

466
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,790
Things change, man.

467
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,390
Negan and that other group,
this is on them.

468
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:28,030
If people die,
it's their fault, not ours.

469
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,130
Daryl, we can't do this.

470
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,600
And we got our own people
to look after.

471
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,970
We're not doing this.

472
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,370
Hey.
I'm not letting you do this.

473
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,810
Ohh!

474
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,980
This ain't your choice.

475
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,270
Hell.

476
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,440
Unh!

477
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,620
Aah!

478
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,430
Daryl!

479
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,360
Get up!

480
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,300
There's a plan.

481
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,840
We got to see it through.

482
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,640
We gotta win.

483
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,170
Yeah, we gotta.

484
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,280
Choke hold's illegal, asshole.

485
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,380
Mm-hmm.
Yes, it is.

486
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,590
Looks like I'm walking.

487
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,190
Yep.

488
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,830
I'll meet you when I'm done
with the last play.

489
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,930
You sure about doing it?

490
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,670
Yeah, I am.

491
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,780
We have lucille
to help us get to the sanctuary.

492
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,420
We have that gun.

493
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,950
We should use it.

494
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,690
Most importantly, gabriel,
we have each other.

495
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,220
People are a resource.

496
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,460
We make it inside, we live.

497
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:46,280
We can take a chance,
we can "gut up,"

498
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,710
Play dead ones
across the courtyard.

499
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,220
Or...

500
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,790
Or I can just kill you,
but that is not what I want.

501
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,560
What I want
is for you to work with me.

502
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,860
That is all I ever want.

503
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,940
I've killed before,
but that's not my greatest sin.

504
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,810
No.

505
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,810
I locked my congregation
out of my church

506
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,150
When this all just started.

507
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,450
I listened to them die...
As I cowered.

508
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,190
I failed them.

509
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,860
I failed god.

510
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:39,860
And every day,
I work to lessen that failure,

511
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,500
To be of service and purpose.

512
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:53,040
Now I offer you
the assurance of a pardon,

513
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,850
Penance, and absolution.

514
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
I will go with you.

515
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,490
I will show you
that working together as equals

516
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:08,460
Is the only true way
to grace, to a future.

517
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,960
I will do this...
If you confess.

518
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,030
Jesus, gabe.

519
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,900
What you did,

520
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:26,140
That is some horrible,
cowardly, spineless shit.

521
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,510
But I guess that's what
a confession's supposed to be,

522
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,710
Right?

523
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,260
My first wife was a real wife.

524
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:46,430
My only real wife.

525
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:50,100
Till death did us part.

526
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,240
It was before this.

527
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,350
I lied to her,
I screwed around on her.

528
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,020
And she was sick.

529
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,020
And when she went...

530
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,760
When she went,
it was during this.

531
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,900
I couldn't put her down.

532
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,740
That is how I was weak.

533
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,250
That is what I will confess.

534
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,480
Because, yeah, maybe we do
bite the big one here.

535
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,290
You're forgiven.

536
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,100
Thanks.

537
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,570
You can keep your gun.

538
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,650
Sucks, gabe, but it looks like
we got to risk eating it...

539
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,980
By eating it.

540
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,580
I don't understand.

541
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,290
You ever done this trick
with the guts before?

542
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
Mm-hmm.

543
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,930
These are putrid,
decaying organs,

544
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,700
Dead blood, piss, and shit

545
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,970
That have been cooking all day
in the virginian sun.

546
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,440
None of your people
ever gotten sick from this?

547
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,710
We're from georgia.

548
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,680
Look at you lucky shits.

549
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,230
Let's make some noise.

550
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,200
Hey!

551
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,100
Hey!
Aah!

552
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,900
Hey!

553
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,370
Oh, damn.

554
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,050
Now, we were due for a delivery
today from my place.

555
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,220
Spotters haven't seen anything.

556
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,820
Yeah, the transport truck
would've turned around,

557
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,890
Seeing the state of things,

558
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,460
But nothing's come up
any of the roads.

559
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:40,700
Chem outpost
doesn't miss deliveries.

560
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,630
Something happened.

561
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,800
That rick guy happened.

562
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,470
Our outposts are getting hit
while...

563
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,740
What is it?

564
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,010
They're coming up the stairs.

565
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,480
Walkers?

566
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,080
The workers.

567
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,820
They said
we'd have to shoot them.

568
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,040
Workers are designated to stay
on the ground level.

569
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,170
Jesus christ.

570
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:26,180
Specifically,
their activity is constrained

571
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,850
To the factory floor
and the outdoor gardens.

572
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,120
It's too hot down there.

573
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,380
And we sure as hell
ain't going outside.

574
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,920
When you gonna fix the power?

575
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,090
It doesn't need fixing.

576
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,790
We're conserving fuel.

577
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,230
Mm?
It's a shared sacrifice.

578
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,130
Oh.
You're sharing now.

579
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,430
Oh.

580
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,770
That sort of tone
is not gonna work for me...

581
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,300
Hey, everyone, everyone!

582
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,800
Look,
we're gonna get through this.

583
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,910
Okay?
We just need some more time.

584
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,640
We need some more water!

585
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,880
There are young people,
old people!

586
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,710
We're rationing that out, too.

587
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,480
We work, you protect us.

588
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,220
That was the deal.

589
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,650
That's how
it was supposed to work.
Yeah.

590
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,920
We need water!

591
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,920
Do you have a plan
for getting us out?!

592
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,160
You heard the man!

593
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,090
You all need to get back
to the factory floor.

594
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,060
Where's negan?

595
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,060
Is he dead?

596
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,640
Answer the question.

597
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:30,540
Everyone has to return
to the factory floor now!

598
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,210
I'm not going anywhere.

599
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,680
I need to correct you
on that point.

600
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,410
Where's negan?!
Gun!

601
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,920
I am negan!

602
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,360
Anyone else want a bullet?

603
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,360
Anyone?

604
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,780
Ah, regina.

605
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,680
Now, why'd you have to go
and do that?

606
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:20,190
I am guessing that a lot of you
fine folks thought

607
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:25,630
I was dead, chewed up,
never to be crapped out again.

608
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:30,230
Well, here's a little refresher
on who the hell I am.

609
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,000
I wear a leather jacket,
I have lucille,

610
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,070
And my nutsack is made of steel.

611
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:40,380
I am not dying
until I am damn good and ready.

612
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,980
Now, if you'll all excuse me,

613
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,380
I am in deep need of a sandwich,
a shower,

614
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,350
And some of that, uh,
wilting lion orchid

615
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,430
Deep-tissue shit that frankie
learned in san francisco.

616
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,360
Hell,
I might do it all at once.

617
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,770
But after that, we have some
serious business to attend to.

618
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,940
Like talking
to my right-hand man.

619
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,940
You see, we got to figure out

620
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:16,180
How all this could've happened
like it happened.

621
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,720
And then...

622
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,050
Well, and then
we're gonna get back

623
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,320
Doing what we have always done.

624
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,790
We will save people.

625
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:32,560
Thank you, negan.
Thank god for you.

626
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,040
And that is why I am here.

627
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:47,040
Gentlemen,
gently take him to number 2.

628
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,640
Gently.

629
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,490
Good news is, I figured out

630
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,290
Where that asshole's gun
came from.

631
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,400
And the bad news?

632
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,330
They're ours.

633
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:19,800
Stolen from the armory.

634
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,600
A worker couldn't have gotten
this many guns

635
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,740
Without us knowing about it.

636
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,740
They couldn't have got one.

637
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,510
No, one of our own did this...
<i>is</i> doing this, right now.

638
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:31,780
Tell me how we find him, simon.

639
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:37,420
We... Find when
the munitions went missing.

640
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,490
Through that, we get an idea
of the how,

641
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,630
Which hopefully leads us
right to who.

642
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,330
But we start with when.

643
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,350
Yo.

644
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,420
Dr. Smartypants.

645
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,400
Big, big chance here.

646
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,000
You solve this thing

647
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,570
With the bad-smelling
convention outside,

648
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,210
I will make you
very, very happy.

649
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,210
But even if you try your best

650
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,080
And I know you try your best

651
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,250
But you don't figure
something out...

652
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,190
I assure you,
I will kill you quickly

653
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,560
So you don't have to see
all the awful, horrific things

654
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,990
That are gonna go down here when
we run out of food and water.

655
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,030
What I'm saying...

656
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,300
Is that I got your back
either way.

657
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,770
You got mine?

658
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,500
Gabriel, it's eugene porter.

659
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,900
Dr. Eugene porter here.

660
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:08,170
We were, uh... Neighbors,
traveling companions.

661
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,770
We've eaten dog together, so...

662
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,380
I imagine that joins us
in some manner for life.

663
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,920
I'm here to formally welcome you
to the sanctuary.

664
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,150
In our current state of siege,
the prickly heat alone

665
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,650
Might be enough
to turn you off the place,

666
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,820
So I took it upon myself

667
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,360
To... Bring you
some welcome-wagon items

668
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,660
In hopes of providing
some relief.

669
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,700
Gabriel?

670
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,820
You need to see
dr. Carson 2.0 a.S.A.P.

671
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,290
I d... i do.

672
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,360
That's why I'm here.
That's why...

673
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,800
It's the reason we're here,
I think.

674
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,900
I think it's...

675
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:18,010
Carson... Is maggie's doctor.

676
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,240
W-we have to get him
out of here.
