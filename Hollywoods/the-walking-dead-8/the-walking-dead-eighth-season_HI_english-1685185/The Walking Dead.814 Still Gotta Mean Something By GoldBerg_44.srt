171
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,520
I took a chance on someone,

172
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,970
thought I was doing the right thing,

173
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,910
and all I did was punch
myself in the dick.

174

I am sorry for this.

175

I'm sorry that you lost all you had.

177

I came out here to keep an eye on you.

Yeah, I've seen it.

It's pretty much our only guess.

224
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,030
There'd been some talk
about trying to get out,

225

but it was just talk, nothin' specific.

226

Thinkin' they had a plan's
giving 'em too much credit.

227
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,430
They saw an opening, and they took it.

228

What if it was you?
How'd you get back there?

229
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,880
You're on foot, there's
probably someone injured.

230
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,790
Maybe you need a place to
hole up and figure things out.

231
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,590
There's an old dive bar three
miles off Edgehill Parkway.

232
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,560
Some of them, uh, took me there once.

233
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,430
They wanted my expert
opinion on what it'd take

234
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,100
to turn the place into an outpost.

235
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,570
It's between here and there,

236
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,340

it's not for nothing...
Can you do me a favor?

don't kill any more of
them than you have to.

243
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,960
When it went bad last night,
they... they made a choice.

244
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,460
It was the wrong choice.

245
