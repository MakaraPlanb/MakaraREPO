00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:04,046
Previously on AMC's
"The Walking Dead"...

2
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:08,796
Save him. Like you saved me.

3
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:11,232
- Wait.
- I liked you, Ezekiel.

4
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:14,529
Your people are gonna look
up at the sanctuary fence,

5
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:17,338
and they're going to
see their king is dead.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,123
We can't just let them have this place.

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,162
We can.

8
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:22,176
All we need to do is survive tonight.

9
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:42,962
"My mercy... prevails...

10
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:45,332
over my wrath."

11
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:54,809
Jerry!

12
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,210
S'up, Jude?!

13
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:58,712
Hey, Rick.

14
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,347
Everything okay?

15
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:02,567
Just came for some of
that butternut skillet cake

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,485
you guys make.

17
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:07,188
You rode out from the
Kingdom for dessert?

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,556
Hells yah.

19
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:11,481
You got roped into masonry duty.

20
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:15,570
Siddiq, man.

21
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:17,565
Dude's impossible to say no to.

22
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,533
Back to it.

23
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:55,536
Just go!

24
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:56,937
You don't have to do this.

25
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,772
Are you okay?

26
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,510
Yeah.

27
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,658
It's just 'til I can talk to my dad.

28
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:59,159
If he's not back soon,
we'll meet him there.

29
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:02,062
Hopefully, they'll be with him.

30
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:03,348
What about Michonne?

31
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,400
Ah.

32
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:58,332
You seeing this?

33
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,160
North copies. Got shots here.

34
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:03,143
West, too. What are they doing?

35
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:05,285
They'll run outta ammo
before they run outta walkers.

36
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:07,247
I got eyes on it.

37
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:09,149
South out.

38
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,844
They're trying to make a path.

39
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,395
Blocking out the walkers with bodies.

40
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:39,513
They're gonna get out.

41
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:40,948
Man, we need to tell everybody...

42
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:48,622
South down!

43
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,770
Get out! Everybody, get out now!

44
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:34,768
Hey! Hey!

45
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:04,608
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

46
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:21,057
I see it.

47
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,625
It got tripped up on my wire.

48
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:23,960
I got it.

49
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:30,967
The cottage is just ahead,
out of the tree-line.

50
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:32,559
It's got a wrought-iron fence.

51
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:34,337
There's food and water inside.

52
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:35,965
The Saviors don't know about it.

53
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,277
You'll be safe there

54
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,175
until I make it back with Ezekiel.

55
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:42,345
You versus all of them?

56
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:44,413
Yeah.

57
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,349
They don't stand a chance.

58
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:48,951
It's not just Carol.

59
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:50,152
I'm going, too.

60
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,122
No. You're not.

61
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:54,899
They killed my brother.

62
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:56,792
And I'm not gonna let 'em kill you.

63
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:58,427
I can do it.

64
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,696
I can help you.

65
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:02,365
Morgan taught me the stick.

66
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:03,633
You taught me the gun.

67
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:05,701
It's not happening.

68
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,375
Come on.

69
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:46,976
I-I don't...

70
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:48,477
Dad.

71
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:56,652
- How...
- Dad...

72
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:00,723
it's all right.

73
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,858
It's gotta be.

74
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,701
I wasn't sure if you'd
make it back before...

75
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:16,129
But just in case, you know...

76
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,355
I wanted to make sure I
was able to say goodbye.

77
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:29,001
No. It's them. It's them.

78
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:32,188
They... They don't...

79
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,957
It wasn't...

80
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,764
Carl.

81
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:44,321
No.

82
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:46,543
I got bit.

83
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:53,209
I was bringing someone back.

84
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:56,879
His name's Siddiq.

85
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,381
We saw him at that gas station,

86
00:12:58,383 --> 00:12:59,915
before...

87
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:04,706
It wasn't the Saviors.

88
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:07,050
It just happened.

89
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:19,568
I got bit.

90
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:31,414
Negan's gonna kill you now.

91
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:39,808
I said he's gonna kill you.

92
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:41,978
And there's nothing
I can do to stop that.

93
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:49,131
Hey. You hear me?

94
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:52,368
I ferried my people to freedom.

95
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,081
What befalls me now matters not.

96
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,916
No. It matters, idiot.

97
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:02,011
I liked you, Ezekiel.

98
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:04,213
You got it.

99
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:06,615
You got that you couldn't do better

100
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:07,855
than you had it.

101
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:10,986
You accepted things for what they were,

102
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:13,723
and you didn't get any
big ideas in your head.

103
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:21,130
And then Rick went and
planted one right in there.

104
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:26,836
And here we are.

105
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:28,804
Shit's getting shittier.

106
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,539
And you're gonna die.

107
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:35,177
I made a choice I could live with.

108
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:38,147
Now it's your turn to do the same.

109
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:58,834
Henry!

110
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:11,849
Hey.

111
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:13,883
They don't have enough people

112
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:14,950
to guard all the walls.

113
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:16,363
No, but they do have people.

114
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:18,917
- And they have Ezekiel.
- I saw him.

115
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,190
They got him on the
other side of this place.

116
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:23,759
We can take them.

117
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:24,977
One by one.

118
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,695
No, if we hit one of them,

119
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:28,531
that could call them all.

120
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,432
It's better just to
avoid them until we can't.

121
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:32,034
Henry.

122
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:34,403
He's here, too.

123
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,105
Where?

124
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:37,773
Did you see him? Do they have him?

125
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:40,309
Yeah, I saw him run this
way, and then he was gone.

126
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:42,036
But he'll hide.

127
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,905
He won't take them on face-to-face.

128
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,449
We have to do this now.

129
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,385
So if we have to take
them, we take them.

130
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:05,497
Is that better?

131
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:08,002
Yeah...

132
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:09,738
Thanks.

133
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:16,642
I, um, I got these.

134
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,377
They're over-the-counter,

135
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:22,848
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.

136
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,149
They'll, um...

137
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,017
They'll help a little with the fever.

138
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:32,725
They did for my mom and dad.

139
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,893
Please take them.

140
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,197
Your son...

141
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:39,898
he should have them.

142
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,971
You're a doctor?

143
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:55,914
I was a resident... before.

144
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,551
Yeah.

145
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,987
Your name is Siddiq?

146
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,771
Yes.

147
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,494
Did you know he was a doctor?

148
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:10,896
Is that why you brought him back?

149
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:14,566
He wasn't gonna make it alone.

150
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:17,502
He needed us.

151
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,672
That's why.

152
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:26,033
He was the one at the gas station.

153
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:36,855
Shh!

154
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:38,590
Water. Give him water.

155
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:42,428
Easy. You got it?

156
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,065
Slowly, slowly.

157
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:58,556
Make it stop.

158
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,249
Make them stop.

159
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:09,788
- I can't.
- You can.

160
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,283
You're one of them.

161
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:12,925
They'll listen to you.

162
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,897
Please.

163
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:25,003
Please.

164
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,190
You said that Hilltop's safe, right?

165
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,189
Yeah.

166
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:50,596
We need to get everybody there.

167
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,353
We can get Carl there.

168
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:57,669
And they think all of
you got away in the woods.

169
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:00,839
They're out there, looking.

170
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:04,009
They saw us go West,
so we won't go West.

171
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:07,171
Your best chance is to stay here

172
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:08,680
until they're gone.

173
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:10,041
No.

174
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:11,344
They find us here, we're dead.

175
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:13,118
They're almost done.

176
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,722
They gotta be.

177
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:20,159
It wasn't about destroying the place.

178
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:24,663
They don't have the ammo for that.

179
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,498
After they let up,

180
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,367
after they're gone,

181
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:30,569
that's when we go.

182
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:47,019
Okay.

183
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:48,353
We wait.

184
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:02,401
You sure going to
Hilltop's the best plan?

185
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:05,604
You got a better one?

186
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:09,119
All of you in one place, together...

187
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:11,330
All of us together...

188
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,514
We'll be their worst damn nightmare.

189
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,627
If we don't go through 'em,

190
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,404
we gotta go through the courtyard.

191
00:20:52,832 --> 00:20:54,298
Exposed.

192
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:58,502
This is it.

193
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,441
This is it.

194
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:31,668
You want me to just do it?

195
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,171
No.

196
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,687
No. No.

197
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,931
Got all of 'em.

198
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,866
They could've found Henry.

199
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:05,369
I know.

200
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:08,105
I'm not worried about them.

201
00:22:12,274 --> 00:22:14,307
Come on, boys.

202
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,315
Get the damn gum off your shoes.

203
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:17,684
Let's go!

204
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:26,423
Is it gonna go bad, Ezekiel?

205
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:30,794
Is this going to turn
into something else?

206
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:33,130
You are the author of this night, Gavin.

207
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:39,035
Its close shall be
fashioned by your start.

208
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,412
You left.

209
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:53,784
You were supposed to be resting.

210
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,321
I'm not tired.

211
00:22:57,323 --> 00:22:58,655
Yeah.

212
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:00,757
You look great.

213
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:07,240
It's gotta stop, Michonne.

214
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:12,060
It's not supposed to be like this.

215
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,474
I know it can be better.

216
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:33,423
Sounds like they're letting up.

217
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:37,861
Looks like you were right.

218
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:40,530
They're leaving.

219
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:42,666
Maybe.

220
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,979
Want me to go take a look?

221
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:00,183
Hey. Hey.

222
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,641
There.

223
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,385
sure as shit gonna beat

224
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:36,720
living in that chemical dump.

225
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,188
Hell, you want that room.

226
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,524
You're gonna have to fight me for it...

227
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,059
Leave it.

228
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:54,037
Leave it.

229
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:00,844
Hey.

230
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,258
Let's go.

231
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:36,313
Leave some room for Ezekiel.

232
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:40,255
Get him a pillow or something.

233
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:41,590
It's gonna be his last ride.

234
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:43,620
Let's at least try to
make him comfortable.

235
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,163
You try, and you try, and you try,

236
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:55,132
and you hope, and you
hope, and you hope.

237
00:25:55,134 --> 00:26:00,103
Just wantin' things
to finally just settle.

238
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:03,159
Achieve some goddamn,
hard-fought equilibrium.

239
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,975
But, no.

240
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:09,813
It always comes down to this.

241
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:15,619
It always has to get dark and ugly...

242
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:17,187
and inhuman.

243
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:23,026
You know I don't like this, right?

244
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:24,666
It is not too late

245
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:27,664
to walk back from something decided.

246
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:31,501
You did,

247
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:33,302
and look where it got you.

248
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,774
Duke. Paulie. Where you at?

249
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:46,883
Stop pickin' dingles, grab your walkie,

250
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:48,427
and respond!

251
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:57,401
Gomez?

252
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:04,668
Gomez!

253
00:27:11,642 --> 00:27:16,011
It is not too late to walk
back from something decided.

254
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:19,850
Shit. There it is.

255
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:22,152
Get him inside. Now!

256
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:07,178
I calibrate this cooker properly,

257
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:09,639
we'll be lousy with
baked apples ad infinitum.

258
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:13,514
It would be my honor

259
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:15,683
if you considered to
be the sous to my chef.

260
00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:18,752
Or I could be said sous,
and you shall surely chef.

261
00:28:18,754 --> 00:28:20,254
'Til then,

262
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:22,456
this Golden Delicious
has your name on it.

263
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:25,693
Thanks, Eugene.

264
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:27,261
Thanks.

265
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:00,794
The Saviors are gone.

266
00:29:00,796 --> 00:29:02,296
We can get everyone to Hilltop.

267
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:03,998
We can get Carl there.

268
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,229
Carl? No.

269
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,636
Daryl can get one of the cars.

270
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:10,871
Carl won't make...

271
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:14,104
He can't leave here.

272
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:16,176
- I have to stay with him.
- Rick.

273
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:18,312
He can't.

274
00:29:18,314 --> 00:29:20,547
I have to stay.

275
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,065
We'll both stay.

276
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,377
Will you...

277
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:34,982
Will you take Judith?

278
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:40,434
She needs to be there.

279
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:41,869
If she...

280
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:44,271
If...

281
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:45,406
happens...

282
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,907
I'll take her.

283
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,777
I'll get her there. I'll keep her safe.

284
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,926
I got this.

285
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:56,328
Let me say goodbye.

286
00:30:17,573 --> 00:30:20,607
You be good, okay?

287
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,576
For Michonne.

288
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:24,190
For Dad.

289
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:30,876
You gotta honor him.

290
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:32,820
Listen when he tells you stuff.

291
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:38,325
You don't have to always.

292
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:41,728
Sometimes, kids got to
show their parents the way.

293
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:04,251
This was Dad's before it was mine.

294
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,320
Now it's yours.

295
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,825
I don't know... Just...

296
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:14,261
Just having it and...

297
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:16,196
It always kept Dad with me.

298
00:31:19,602 --> 00:31:21,768
It made me feel as strong as him.

299
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:30,811
It helped me.

300
00:31:30,813 --> 00:31:33,013
Maybe it'll help you, too.

301
00:31:41,157 --> 00:31:43,323
Before Mom died...

302
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:50,664
she told me that I was
gonna beat this world.

303
00:31:54,003 --> 00:31:55,335
I didn't.

304
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,240
But you will.

305
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:04,645
I know you will.

306
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:10,417
Here we go.

307
00:32:19,194 --> 00:32:21,394
These people.

308
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:25,199
You saved them all.

309
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:27,100
That's all you, man.

310
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,027
You were helping me honor my mom...

311
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:56,029
Not just yours.

312
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:58,732
Mine, too.

313
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,270
You brought me here.

314
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,823
You gave me a chance.

315
00:33:08,477 --> 00:33:12,813
I know I can never repay you...

316
00:33:12,815 --> 00:33:14,982
but I can honor you

317
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:19,453
by showing your people, your f-friends,

318
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,788
your... your family

319
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:28,262
that what you did wasn't for nothing.

320
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:29,763
That it mattered.

321
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:33,300
That it... That it meant something.

322
00:33:36,272 --> 00:33:37,971
Because it did.

323
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:42,142
So that's what I'm gonna do.

324
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:49,182
I'm gonna honor you, Carl.

325
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:58,678
Congratulations.

326
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:01,991
You're stuck with us.

327
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:40,944
Okay.

328
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:43,447
There can't be a lot of 'em
'cause there aren't a lot left.

329
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,749
We got room for us
and controlled access.

330
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,751
Force projected on the doors, now!

331
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:52,875
We end this, whatever the hell it is.

332
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:54,577
I gotta settle this shit

333
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,794
under the penalty of that goddamn bat.

334
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,797
You don't.

335
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,134
Shut up about that, okay?

336
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:05,202
This is it!

337
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:07,288
It is too late.

338
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,707
I'm the "author," you're the dead man,

339
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:12,943
and that's how it's gonna be.

340
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,546
You think I can be someone else?

341
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:18,315
This is who I am.

342
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:22,041
I live, you die... This is what this is!

343
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:24,991
The petty compromises
I made to avoid conflict

344
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:26,223
were always done

345
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,359
in the name of saving my people's lives.

346
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,663
Now I realize...

347
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:35,632
I was saving yours.

348
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,568
No more.

349
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:09,533
Give up, or he's dead.

350
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,786
Aah!

351
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,998
Jesus.

352
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:05,982
Morgan, we should take our leave.

353
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:07,684
We don't need to go.

354
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:09,553
All of them are dead.

355
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:45,355
You okay?

356
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:50,661
I don't want you to be sad after this.

357
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:52,829
- Carl...
- Or angry.

358
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:59,336
You're gonna have to be strong.

359
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,738
For my dad.

360
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,974
For Judith.

361
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:09,146
For yourself.

362
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,690
I will.

363
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,928
Don't carry this.

364
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,030
Not this part.

365
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,871
You're my best friend, Michonne.

366
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:42,913
You're mine, too.

367
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:47,017
You're mine.

368
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:03,400
I need your help.

369
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,302
With what?

370
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,772
Getting him out of here.

371
00:40:50,355 --> 00:40:51,822
We need to stop.

372
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:56,559
The house up ahead. We can make it.

373
00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:59,296
It's okay. Just put me down here.

374
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:00,464
It's okay.

375
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:02,799
- No. We'll make it.
- Please.

376
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:07,537
There.

377
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:30,410
Thanks... for...

378
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:32,785
For getting me here.

379
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,719
I'm... I'm sorry.

380
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:37,961
I-I just...

381
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:40,015
I didn't... I didn't want you out there.

382
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,250
- I-I...
- No.

383
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:45,268
No... for getting me here.

384
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,868
For... For making it

385
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:53,376
so I could be who...

386
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:55,612
Who I wound up.

387
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,297
Back at the prison...

388
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:16,299
when we got attacked...

389
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:23,740
there was a kid,

390
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:26,343
a little older than me.

391
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:28,612
He had a gun.

392
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,351
He was...

393
00:43:34,353 --> 00:43:37,921
He was starting to put it down,

394
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:40,924
and I-I s...

395
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:43,128
I shot him.

396
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:48,832
He was... He was giving it up,

397
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:53,336
and I... I just...

398
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:55,272
I shot him.

399
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,111
I think about him.

400
00:44:01,113 --> 00:44:03,204
What I did to him

401
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,882
and how...

402
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:11,821
How easy it was to just... kill him.

403
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,027
You're sick!

404
00:44:19,398 --> 00:44:22,999
Only a sick man would do it like this.

405
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:28,305
You think I wanted this?

406
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:30,840
There wasn't a lot on the menu.

407
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:33,510
I ran a good crew.

408
00:44:33,512 --> 00:44:35,178
I kept my word.

409
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,547
You ask Ezekiel... I kept my word!

410
00:44:42,387 --> 00:44:44,329
You... You could...

411
00:44:44,332 --> 00:44:46,489
You could go back to the Hilltop.

412
00:44:46,491 --> 00:44:47,665
It's still standing.

413
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:49,859
They're keeping them going.

414
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:51,361
Just turn around.

415
00:44:57,647 --> 00:45:00,381
You think you can beat Negan?

416
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,606
You can't.

417
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,178
We can go back to how it was.

418
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,274
We can go back...

419
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,084
No.

420
00:45:16,187 --> 00:45:20,856
Carl, no.

421
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:22,792
No.

422
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:30,433
What happened...

423
00:45:30,435 --> 00:45:32,602
what you'd lost...

424
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,874
All those things you had to...

425
00:45:39,144 --> 00:45:40,477
All those thing you had to do...

426
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,746
You... You... You... You were just...

427
00:45:42,748 --> 00:45:44,914
You were just a boy.

428
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:47,584
And you saw it.

429
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:50,887
What it did.

430
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:55,992
How... How easy it got.

431
00:45:55,994 --> 00:46:00,630
You just killed all those
men because of the kid?!

432
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:11,341
Killing me won't make any of it go away.

433
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:17,080
You'll still wake up to
the same shit tomorrow.

434
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:22,519
Get up.

435
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:24,118
Up.

436
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:25,152
Ugh! Aah!

437
00:46:28,427 --> 00:46:32,529
That's why you changed...

438
00:46:32,531 --> 00:46:36,599
why you brought those
people from Woodbury in...

439
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:42,172
You brought them in, and
we all lived together.

440
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:46,676
We were enemies.

441
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,512
You put away your gun.

442
00:46:49,514 --> 00:46:54,217
You did it so I could change,

443
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:59,956
so I could be who I am now.

444
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:06,129
What you did then...

445
00:47:06,131 --> 00:47:10,500
How you... How you stopped fighting...

446
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:13,670
it was right.

447
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,542
It still is.

448
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:25,815
It can be like that again.

449
00:47:25,817 --> 00:47:28,551
You can still be like that again.

450
00:47:33,663 --> 00:47:35,396
Morgan.

451
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,561
Morgan, cease this.

452
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:41,231
Relent.

453
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:45,902
Ending him is the coward's way.

454
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,705
We've won.

455
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:50,440
We don't have to kill him.

456
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,911
He will see what he has wrought,

457
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,946
and all of it will be his to live with.

458
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:06,371
I can't be who I was.

459
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:07,933
It's different now.

460
00:48:07,936 --> 00:48:10,004
You can't kill all of 'em, Dad.

461
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:14,531
There's gotta be something after.

462
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:18,034
For you... and for them.

463
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,941
There's gotta be something after.

464
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:29,712
Morgan, stop it.

465
00:48:29,714 --> 00:48:32,549
You don't want to do
this. You don't have to.

466
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:36,738
You told me we can be better than them.

467
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:38,555
You said that to me.

468
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,626
You don't want to do this.

469
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:45,662
I know it. I can see it.

470
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,266
I have...

471
00:48:53,405 --> 00:48:55,171
I have to.

472
00:49:00,745 --> 00:49:02,779
I have to.

473
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:44,354
I know... you can't see it yet...

474
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:48,157
how it could be.

475
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,062
But I have...

476
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:58,134
You have a beard.

477
00:49:58,136 --> 00:50:02,372
It's... It's bigger...

478
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,407
and grayer...

479
00:50:05,644 --> 00:50:08,378
Michonne's happy...

480
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,147
Judith is older,

481
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:15,151
and she's listening to the
songs that I used to before...

482
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:19,129
Alexandria's bigger.

483
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:21,090
There's...

484
00:50:21,092 --> 00:50:24,427
There's new houses...

485
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:28,598
crops...

486
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,366
and people working.

487
00:50:33,004 --> 00:50:36,506
Everybody living...

488
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:38,608
helping everybody else live.

489
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,449
If you can still be who you were...

490
00:50:46,451 --> 00:50:48,418
that's how it could be.

491
00:50:52,202 --> 00:50:53,923
It could.

492
00:50:58,029 --> 00:51:00,196
Carl.

493
00:51:00,198 --> 00:51:04,100
It was all for you.

494
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:09,605
Right from the start.

495
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:15,878
Back in Atlanta, the farm...

496
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,084
Everything I did, it was for you.

497
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:25,621
Then, at the prison, it
was for you and Judith.

498
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:27,066
It still is.

499
00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:28,491
It's gonna be.

500
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:32,628
And nothing... Nothing
is gonna change that.

501
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,467
I want this for you, Dad.

502
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,808
I'm gonna make it real, Carl.

503
00:51:47,811 --> 00:51:49,078
I promise.

504
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,348
I'm gonna make it real.

505
00:52:10,771 --> 00:52:13,606
Henry.

506
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:16,809
It's okay.

507
00:52:16,811 --> 00:52:19,045
It's all right.

508
00:52:19,047 --> 00:52:22,081
Don't look at him. You look at me.

509
00:52:23,638 --> 00:52:26,005
I had to.

510
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:28,775
You were supposed to
stay at the cottage.

511
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,489
This wasn't what you
were supposed to do.

512
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:32,058
This wasn't for you. Carol.

513
00:52:41,642 --> 00:52:45,344
Henry.

514
00:52:45,347 --> 00:52:47,247
All will be resolved.

515
00:52:53,275 --> 00:52:55,475
All will be resolved.

516
00:52:59,515 --> 00:53:02,616
Carl... I'm sorry.

517
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:09,341
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

518
00:53:11,827 --> 00:53:14,995
A father's job is to protect his son.

519
00:53:17,466 --> 00:53:18,575
Love.

520
00:53:21,837 --> 00:53:25,439
It's just to love.

521
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,721
No. No.

522
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:50,163
Carl...

523
00:53:50,165 --> 00:53:52,733
It... It... It... It should be...

524
00:53:52,735 --> 00:53:54,713
I know. I know.

525
00:53:54,716 --> 00:53:57,130
Somebody you love.

526
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:01,668
When you can't do it yourself.

527
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,838
But I still can.

528
00:54:08,717 --> 00:54:10,489
I grew up.

529
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:18,558
I have to do this.

530
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,093
Me.

531
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:33,173
I love you.

532
00:54:33,175 --> 00:54:36,576
I love you, too.

533
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:50,123
I love you, Dad.

534
00:54:57,099 --> 00:55:00,734
I love you, Carl.

535
00:55:00,736 --> 00:55:02,469
I love you so much.

536
00:55:10,746 --> 00:55:12,879
I'll make it real.

537
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:16,771
I will.

538
00:55:16,885 --> 00:55:18,418
I will.

539
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,126
Good morning.

540
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:03,864
Well, good morning to you, darlin'.
