just killing other people.

59

Well, you think
we're gonna be out there,

60

77

Eric and I used to take
trips like this...

78
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,840
back when we were
looking for people

79
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,180
to bring to Alexandria.

80
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,380
We drove to the Hilltop
just a few days ago

81
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,950
and...helped armor
those cars.

82
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,060
He was always right there,
where you are now.

83
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,190
I was just...

84
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,390
remembering that.

85
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,330
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,100
I need to make sure
he died for a reason.

87
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,840

88
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,740

89
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,740

about Oceanside.

90

91
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,650
I hope so.

92
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,420
We got to try not to scare them.

93
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,520
Tara said that, up until her,

94
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,450
they killed on sight.

95
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,590
It's going to be a risk.

96
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,000

be a part of this.

97
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,900

98
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,270

99
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,070
We should've brought guns
for them.

100
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,910

to those guns.

00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,170
We can stop this.

352
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh, now you want to talk?

353
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,840
See, your dad had it
that I died,

354
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,280
He gave my people a choice.

355
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,550
Not me.

356
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,750
Now we're gonna need
a new understanding.

357
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,450
Apologies, punish--

358
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,050
Kill me.

359
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,130
What did you say?

360
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,300
If you have to kill someone,

361
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,570
if there has to be punishment,

362
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,610
then kill me.

363
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,310
I'm serious.

364
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,380
You wanna die?

365
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,320
No, I don't.

366
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,660
But I will.

367
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,790
It's gonna happen.

368
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:12,500
And i-- if me dying
could stop this,

369
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,430
if it can
make things different --

370
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,910
for us, for you,
for all those other kids --

371
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,370
it'd be worth it.

372
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,650
I mean, was this the plan?

373
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,350
Was it supposed to be this way?

374
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,090
Is this who you wanted to be?

There's one person here

who has to answer
for all of this.

400
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,210
Ezekiel.

401
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,780
I need him.

402
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,710
We haven't found him yet.

403
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,980
I don't expect anyone
to give him up.

404
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,920
But I will say,
to do yourselves a favor

405
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,420
and cooperate now.

406
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,830
We didn't see
any goons with dreadlocks

407
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,900
back at what was left
of the homestead,

408
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,000
so he's gotta be here.

409
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,740
There are rules,
and he broke them!

410
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,580
And if you do not
give him up right now,

411
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:43,120
this...moves into
something traumatic.

412
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,620
I don't want that.

413
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,530
Don't make this any worse
than it already is.

414
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,600
There's goddamn kids here.

415
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,770
They don't need
to see this shit.

416
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,550
All right.

417
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,350
You got five minutes.

418
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,990
Then it's Negan's way.

419
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,590
And that's on you.

420
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,630
Not me.

421
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,700
How'd you get out?

422
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,040
Three guesses.

423
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,440
Well, let's just say
we figured it out.

424
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,520
What'd you do to the others --
Oh, yes!

425
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,220
That's exactly
where I was going next.

426
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,990
Right now, Kingdom is getting
its innards splayed out

427
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,890
for the world to see.

428
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,190
And the Saviors will be taking
possession of that property,

429
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,360
starting tonight.

430
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,600
Same with Alexandria.

431
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,530

make it complicated.

that you are the one

to make things right.

Who, by the way,

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,620
I was admittedly skeptical of,

448
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,990
but, man, worked out
like gangbusters.

449
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,960
He helped us get
out of the situation

450
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,790
with the masses of the cold
and impolite.

451
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,600
And now my guys are leading
the rest of the herd away.

452
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,000
So...

453
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,070
this can go one of two ways.

454
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,110
One,
I can kill this likable gent

455
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,010
on his knees over there,

456
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,410
drag you out of this car,

457
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,320
and put you in this box.

458
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,520
Hmm?

459
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,660
In which you will not
suffocate to death...

460
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,430
like your friend.

461
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,470

462
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,970
And then we take you to Hilltop,

463
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,340
gather everyone up,

464
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,740
and kill you
in front of the whole place.

465
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,540
And then drag you
back to Sanctuary

466
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,680
and put on the spike
in front of HQ.

467
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,780
And then my people
will lead the walker herd

468
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,020
to the Hilltop

469
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,020

00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,930
However, on a personal note,
it is my sincere opinion

570
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,100
that venturing from
the confines of this infirmary

571
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,270
will be a fatal mistake.

572
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,740
The doctor is more than capable
of returning on his own.

573
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,570
You, on the other hand,
will likely succumb to illness

574
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,310
or bodily rending en route.

575
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,280
But I know that that's
the stratagem you're choosing,

576
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,540
and it's a dirty game.

577
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,650
Will one of you please tell me

578
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,120
what the hell is going on?

579
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,220
Gabriel believes
he's on a mission from God

580
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,890
to return you to Hilltop

581
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,960
to tend to the birthing
of Maggie and Glenn's child.

582
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,990
Look, he --
he can't go anywhere.

583
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,430
That is a conversation

584
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,130
the two of you need
to have sotto, solo.

585
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,230
I'm just here to inform you

586
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,600
that the guard
at the Northside gate is OOC.

587
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,300
What you choose to do or not do
with that knowledge

588
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,070
is none of my beeswax
or card stacks.

589
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,940

You killed a guard?

590
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,510
No.

591
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,180
His coffee was compromised.

592
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,180
He's currently riding
a porcelain bus

593
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,020
with laxative and melted
sugar-free-gum-induced diarrhea.

594
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,090
In fact,
unless he was fleet of foot,

595
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,820
he may very well be

596
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,700
catastrophically crapping
his khakis right now.

597
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,030

598
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,400
