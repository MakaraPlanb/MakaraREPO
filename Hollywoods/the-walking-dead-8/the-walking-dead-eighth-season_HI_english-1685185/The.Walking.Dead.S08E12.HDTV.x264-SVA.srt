Not true.

watermills, silos,
hand-drawn schematics,

689

guides to refining grain,
creating lumber, aqueducts...

690
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:35,068

Was to go on to Hilltop

752
00:44:00,624 --> 00:44:04,350
and put the fear of God in these people

753
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:07,080
so that, finally, once and for all,

754
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:09,183
they get with the program.

755

But after what just happened,
what they did to Negan,

756
00:44:17,272 --> 00:44:23,276

need from them is beyond them.
