662
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,530
- <font color="#ff00ff">[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS]</font>
- How did he die?

663
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,030
Was it us?

664
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,950
Was it the grenades?

665

<i>The fire?</i>

666
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,970

I, um... I am sorry.

678
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,730
You know, I wanted him
to be part of things.

679
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,130
I had plans.

680
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,060
He... That kid...

681
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,240
That kid was the future.

685
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,520
<i>Why are you fighting?
Why are you making this so hard?</i>

686
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,590
Carl is dead because of you.

687
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,340
Because you couldn't leave shit
well enough alone.

688
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,280
<i>I mean, hell, maybe he woulda
died some other way.</i>

689
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,600
<i>Any one of us can get our ticket
punched at any second.</i>

690
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,100
but in this case...

691
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,480
in this case...

692
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,520
he is dead because of you.

693
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,110
Because you weren't there

694
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,080
to stop him from doing something stupid.

<i>But someone is.</i>

702
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,020
You see, I stop people from dying.

703
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,820
I am the answer.

704
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,740
Now, it may have taken a hard
lesson for you to hear it,

705
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,300
but you should hear it now.

706
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,670
It's time.

707
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,870
Do not let any more
of your shit decisions

You could have just let me

719
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:55,170
I mean, that's why I killed
your friends in the first place.

720
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,170

<i>but you won't.</i>

723

You failed.

724
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,310
You failed as a leader,

725
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,670
and most of all, Rick,
you failed as a father.
