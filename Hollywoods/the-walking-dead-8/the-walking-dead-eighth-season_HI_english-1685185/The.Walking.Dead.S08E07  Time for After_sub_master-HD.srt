forgotten in your request

171
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,620
is that I am a small person

172
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,380
who does not stick his neck out

173
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,050
for anyone other than himself.

174
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
I stick firmly within my lane

175
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,880
without any need for a
signal, hand or automatic.

176
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,450
All I want is for you
to do the right thing.

177
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,250
And what is said definition on that?

178
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,950
Can't say I ever sussed it out.

179
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,910
Right for some can be
downright horrific for others,

180
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,310
and knowing that has kept me vertical

181
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,900
when so many have gone horizontal.

182
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,720
It requires faith, trusting yourself.

183
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,720
Believing that God is inside of you...

184
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,010
guiding you...

185
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,120
and knowing that he has
a plan for all of us.

186
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,420
Is that so hard?

187
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,690
It's absurd.

188
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,810
Is it?

189
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,520
You're a man of science...

190
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,580
who not too long ago...
would've found it

191
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,810
impossible to believe
that the dead could walk.

maybe it's not impossible to believe

195
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,980
that you will know
what the right thing is

196
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,940

197
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,050

You said a week. It's been a week.

213
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,630
Our deal? My boombox?

214
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,290
- Well, yes, I mean...
- Did you fix it?

215
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,640
A-Are you serious?

216
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

217
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,620
Well, it's not ready.

218
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,390
Our neck is in the
noose of the deceased,

219
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,110
and it is tightening
with every ticktock.

220
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,950
Are you... not distressed
that we're trapped?

221
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,630
I was already trapped here.

222
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,190
You've got until tomorrow, Eugene,

223
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,960
and then we renegotiate.

224
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,940
Wait.

226
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,290
Would it be possible to take
possession of the second bottle

despite the delivery delinquency?

228
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,830
The deal was one bottle up front

229
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,820
and one bottle after you fix it.

230
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,140
I need it.

232
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,220
I've taken to throwing 1.5 fluid
ounces down my gullet most P.M.s

233
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,810
as a necessary requirement

234

increasingly elusive Z's.

235
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,280

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,030
I need help sleeping, too.

239
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,520
I don't get it.

240
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,340
Yes, you do.

241
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,870
You help them, Eugene.

242
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,410
You help him.

243
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,180
I tried to stop this.

244
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,910
Me and Frankie, we came to you,

245
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,260
and we asked you for your help.

246
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,250
You could've changed this
place into something else,

247
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,710
something better.

248
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,930
But you took care of you,

249
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,950
and now you've got to live with that.

250
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,940
I hope this helps.

251
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,000
But it won't.

from the upper windows,

you crash the truck into the walkers

see the truck comin'.

There weren't any more weapons

272
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,430

273
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,330
No more rockets for the RPG's.

I will never, not on your Nelly,

what I imagine most will
calculate as the right thing,

535
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,500
rolled your D20s and came up dead

but I'm seeing 20 for 20,

I'm feeling 10 for 10,
I'm receiving 5 by 5

540
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,710
that staying safe means staying alive,

541
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,650
and I'm A-okay with
doing whatever it takes

542

to lock that down.

543
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,440

544
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,340
I will not cover for
anyone's U-turn on loyalties,

545
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,890
and I will damn well make sure

546

that Dr. Carson stays
cozy, comfy right here

549
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,890
Because I will survive.

550
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,290
