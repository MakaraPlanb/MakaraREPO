00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,296
Hey, kiddo.

3
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:27,465
- What?
- I found something.

4
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,703
You gotta check this out.

5
00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:32,805
"Jumanji."

6
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:36,007
Board game?

7
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,546
Who plays board games?

8
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:14,446
Parry. Parry.

9
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,648
Evade. Blam.

10
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,385
Uppercut.

11
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:19,619
Head slam.
You're dead.

12
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:22,423
Strike. Strike.
Counterstrike. Head slam.

13
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,756
Ka-pow.

14
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:26,892
<i>Get ready. Fight.</i>

15
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:29,562
I got it.

16
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:40,642
"...Benjamin Franklin,

17
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:43,144
"and it was this sense
of national exceptionalism

18
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:46,982
that fueled the spreading
wildfire of westward expansion."

19
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:48,518
Spencer? Honey?

20
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,954
Aah! Mom, what did we say
about the knocking?

21
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:54,890
I'm late for work. You going
to your father's after school?

22
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:56,893
- Yeah, probably.
- Don't forget your EpiPen.

23
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,027
Please, remember,
the world is terrifying.

24
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:00,497
Be careful of everything.

25
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,864
I love you
more than life itself. Bye.

26
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,165
- See you Sunday night.
- Okay.

27
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:12,476
- Later, Mama.
- Eat something.

28
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:13,877
I can't.
I gotta go meet Spencer.

29
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,647
- Spencer Gilpin?
- Yeah, Spencer Gilpin.

30
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,049
He's, uh...
He's been tutoring me.

31
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:20,718
- He's helping get my grades up.
- I love to hear that.

32
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,953
- Little Spencer Gilpin.
- Yeah.

33
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,791
- Your grades gonna be okay?
- That's why I'm getting help.

34
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:28,192
I'd hate for you
to get dropped from the team...

35
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:30,464
I'm not gonna get dropped
from the team.

36
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:34,569
It's... It's gonna
be fine. Okay?

37
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,514
Mm.

38
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,555
Okay.

39
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:58,759
That's cute, right?

40
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:00,598
Yeah.

41
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,457
- Yo.
- Hey, Fridge.

42
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,558
Why you wearing a raincoat?

43
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,859
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's not raining.

44
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,628
Oh, well, it might.

45
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,796
I mean, you never know
what's gonna happen.

46
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,701
- Oy vey.
- What the hell, man?

47
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,304
Do you mind?
Can we speed this up?

48
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,872
Freak House makes me
very uncomfortable.

49
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,845
Here you go.

50
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,579
- You proofread everything?
- Yeah, I proofed it.

51
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,683
And I gave it a beginning...

52
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,019
and an ending
and s-some in the middle.

53
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:55,887
I would've done it myself,
if I had the time or whatever,

54
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,024
- but...
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

55
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:01,060
Hey, man, I was thinking, so...
I mean, it's been really fun,

56
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,597
doing your papers
and your homework and stuff,

57
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:05,832
but I don't know
what you're doing this weekend.

58
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:08,734
- I was thinking maybe we could...
- This weekend. Yeah, ah...

59
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:11,705
- Hey, Fridge.
- Hey.

60
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:14,006
You need a ride?

61
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,109
- I'm going with her.
- You know what?

62
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:20,113
That's actually better for me,
scheduling-wise, too, so...

63
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:21,918
See you later, Refrigerator.

64
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:24,985
Sorry. Sorry.

65
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:27,057
What up, girl?

66
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,659
Whatever.

67
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:32,594
It's not like
I was your best friend

68
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:33,796
for your entire childhood.

69
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:35,364
- That's fine.
- What'd you say?

70
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:40,805
Uh, nothing, sir.

71
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,240
Oh, that guy is super weird.

72
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:46,042
That poor man.

73
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:48,781
So awful what happened
to those people.

74
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,649
I was talking about the kid.

75
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:52,916
What are you doing out here?

76
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:54,788
I was just talking
to my friend.

77
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:57,254
You should be more careful

78
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:58,755
where you loiter,
you hear me?

79
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:00,757
Yes, Mr. Vreeke. I hear you.

80
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,698
This world swallows up
kids like you.

81
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:23,850
It's been over two
hours since I've posted,

82
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:25,985
and he hasn't commented.
He hasn't even liked it.

83
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,154
- You saw it.
<i>- Yeah, gorge.</i>

84
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,989
<i>I don't know
what his problem is.</i>

85
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,126
Thank you. It's not like
I post all the time,

86
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:33,727
just enough
to stay relevant.

87
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:35,162
But it's cute enough
for Noah to...

88
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,200
<i>Hey, there's
some rando behind you.</i>

89
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,934
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:43,872
Bethany, did you just make
a call during a quiz?

91
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:45,407
Yeah. But I finished
my quiz already.

92
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:49,680
Oh, okay. Well, have you noticed
that other people haven't?

93
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:53,849
- So?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Let me back up.

94
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:57,185
You're aware there are other
people in the world, right?

95
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:00,424
Look, um, you know,

96
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:02,991
I'm dealing with something
right now,

97
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:04,994
and I'm no happier
about it than you are.

98
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:07,763
I'm having a crisis,
and Lucinda, I mean,

99
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:09,433
she's supporting me
as a woman,

100
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,770
and it feels like
maybe you should too.

101
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:15,305
- Just hang up the phone.
- Okay, I'll wrap it up.

102
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:18,308
- Bethany, hang it up now.
- Two minutes and we're done.

103
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,178
And that's detention.

104
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,117
All right, keep
those arms pumping.

105
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:25,717
Let's go!

106
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,084
Bethany, you're late.

107
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:28,222
Sorry.

108
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,058
I heard she broke up
with that football guy.

109
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,027
This could be
your opening, Fussfeld.

110
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,196
We're gonna practice

111
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:39,466
catching and throwing.

112
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:42,972
So partner up and grab
a football. Let's move!

113
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,473
Hey, Martha.

114
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:50,043
Martha. You can't
play catch by yourself.

115
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:51,746
Pair up.

116
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,313
Come on. Let's go.

117
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:55,185
No. No, I'm good.

118
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:57,251
Okay.

119
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:03,925
You have to participate
just like everybody else.

120
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:06,227
Otherwise,
why are you even here?

121
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,462
It's a requirement.

122
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,097
- Martha...
- I think it's pointless.

123
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:11,165
Gym class is not gonna get me
into Princeton,

124
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,301
and I don't understand
the obsession with throwing

125
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,937
a ball into a hoop
and, "Touchdown, five points!"

126
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:19,041
Okay. There's a lot wrong
with that, but first of all...

127
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,210
It's physical activity,
which is good for you.

128
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,412
With other people,
also good for you.

129
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:27,049
And if you try it,
you might even have some fun.

130
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:29,519
Fun. That's what
we're doing here? Fun?

131
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:31,221
This is school.

132
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:33,856
We are supposed to be
learning things that matter.

133
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:35,158
- Okay, Martha...
- We don't have

134
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,261
a lot of time in this life,
and I personally

135
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:40,767
don't wanna waste it on being,
like, a gym teacher.

136
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:45,970
- That... That came out wrong.
- Yeah, it sure did.

137
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:47,808
That's detention.

138
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,544
That was hard-core.

139
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,444
Badass.

140
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:56,251
Spencer Gilpin?

141
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:00,956
Have a seat, Spencer.

142
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,032
Miss Mathers?

143
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:15,536
"And it was this sense
of national exceptionalism

144
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:19,574
that fueled the spreading
wildfire of westward expansion."

145
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:22,313
Does that sound familiar,
Mr. Gilpin?

146
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:26,849
- It does not.
- It's the last sentence

147
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,051
of Anthony's paper
on westward expansion.

148
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:31,519
And, coincidentally,
it's the last sentence

149
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:34,892
of your paper on westward
expansion from last year.

150
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,461
That's interesting.

151
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:41,231
Is it?

152
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,500
I think so. I mean,
what are the odds of that?

153
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:46,134
Slim.

154
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:49,072
Yeah, you also
used the same metaphor:

155
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:51,207
"the spreading wildfire,"
in your papers

156
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,944
on the Boston Tea Party,
the Battle of Gettysburg,

157
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,250
and the women's suffrage
movement.

158
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:02,319
It's so hot in this room.

159
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:06,090
Anthony, I know how much
you need to pass my class,

160
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:07,492
but this is not
how you do it.

161
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:10,229
- I will not tolerate cheating.
- Cheating?

162
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:12,397
I didn't... I didn't...
I didn't cheat.

163
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,835
It was my fault.

164
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:16,969
I made him do it.

165
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:22,177
You made him...
have you write his paper?

166
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,110
Yeah.

167
00:11:25,112 --> 00:11:26,647
Mm-hm.

168
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,119
Look.
I'm sorry, okay?

169
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:34,255
No, no,
it's not okay.

170
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:36,989
What the hell, man?
You got me kicked off the team.

171
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:39,091
Yeah, well, you could've
gotten me expelled.

172
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:41,995
It's not like you're the only
one who's living dangerously.

173
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,463
- Living dangerously?
- Yes.

174
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:47,201
This is the most dangerous thing
I've ever done in my life.

175
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:50,305
And now look at me.
I'm paying the price.

176
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,007
Well...

177
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,077
isn't this a fun group?

178
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,016
Welcome to detention.

179
00:11:58,581 --> 00:11:59,616
Yes, Spencer?

180
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,251
I wanna say that I'm sorry.

181
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,619
- Thank you.
- Bentley, all I did was make...

182
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:06,156
Bethany, please.
You're all here for a reason.

183
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,457
You know what it is.

184
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,693
But this is what
you should be thinking about:

185
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,728
Who you are...

186
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,498
in this moment in time,

187
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,435
and who you want to be.

188
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,737
You get one life.

189
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,105
You decide
how you're gonna spend it.

190
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,610
Fortunately...

191
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,647
there is no better place
for self-reflection

192
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,115
than detention.

193
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,953
Get up, everybody. Let's go.

194
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:47,633
We are turning this
into a new computer center.

195
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:50,270
But before we do,
it has to be cleaned out.

196
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:53,072
These old magazines are bound
for the recycling plant.

197
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:55,675
But they have to be prepped
before they go.

198
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:59,513
It seems all the staples
must be removed.

199
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:02,416
Whatever you don't finish today,
you finish tomorrow.

200
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:04,551
- Tomorrow's Saturday.
- Because I wouldn't play?

201
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:06,521
- I don't think that'll work.
- That's fair.

202
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:10,624
- Shut up.
- So I suggest you get started.

203
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:13,163
Choose your weapons.

204
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:21,404
Hey, what the hell
they need with a bowling ball?

205
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,508
Seriously, no reception?

206
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,143
- Okay, can today get any worse?
- Are you gonna help?

207
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:29,613
Or are you too pretty?

208
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:31,514
I'm too pretty.

209
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:39,356
Hey. I was watching you
with Coach Web today.

210
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,225
I wasn't watching you,
I wasn't...

211
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:42,827
Not, like, in a weird way.
I just...

212
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:44,761
I was in the room.
We're in the same class.

213
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:47,832
Um, but I thought you were
saying some really smart things

214
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:51,135
about why P.E. sucks
and, um...

215
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:53,304
about other subjects.

216
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,442
Thanks.

217
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:58,078
Yeah.

218
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,483
Yo. What's this?

219
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,153
- I don't know.
- What is it, like,

220
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:10,490
some type of old-school
Nintendo or something?

221
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:12,225
I don't think so.

222
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,296
I don't recognize it.

223
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:34,649
"A game for those
who seek to find...

224
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:37,520
"a way to leave
their world behind.

225
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,656
Jumanji."

226
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:43,259
Staples, people. Staples.

227
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:44,593
"Jumanji"?
What does that mean?

228
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,629
I have no idea.
Never heard of it.

229
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:51,199
Hm...

230
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:52,703
Uh, which one do I pick?

231
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:55,338
I don't know. I don't
think it matters that much.

232
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,141
"Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough.

233
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:00,411
Pilot and rascal."

234
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:03,381
- It's not working.
- Okay, try another one.

235
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:06,151
"Franklin 'Moose' Finbar."

236
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:07,618
Hm.

237
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,887
He sounds like a badass.

238
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,327
And he's a zoology expert,
which is awesome.

239
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,097
- You pick.
- Okay.

240
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,602
"Dr. Smolder Bravestone."

241
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:26,539
Bethany, you in?

242
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,142
Fine.

243
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,511
I'll be...

244
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:34,648
Shelly Oberon...

245
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,948
the curvy genius.

246
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,786
Hey, yo, Staples, come on.
It's your turn.

247
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:41,289
Uh, no.

248
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,790
- No, thanks.
- Wait. Just for a few minutes?

249
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,793
It'll be fun.

250
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:47,197
She's not big on fun.

251
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,270
Okay. Fine.

252
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:59,408
This may be the
lamest thing I've ever done.

253
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,211
I highly doubt that.

254
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:09,554
<i>Welcome to Jumanji!</i>

255
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,365
What's going on?

256
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:26,306
I think it's shorting out.

257
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,249
Unplug it!

258
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,590
Whoa!

259
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:45,524
What's going on?
What's happening to your hands?

260
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,796
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

261
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:52,634
Spencer!

262
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:55,035
Oh, my God!

263
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:57,607
Oh-oh-oh...

264
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:03,010
Aah!

265
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,880
What the hell, man?

266
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:07,382
Oh, no.

267
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:11,256
Holy shit...

268
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,894
Whoa!

269
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:24,502
Aah.

270
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:46,723
Guys?

271
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:50,430
Guys? Why do I
sound like this?

272
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,307
Where's my hair?

273
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,684
What the...?

274
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:13,490
Oh, God!

275
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,390
Ow, unh.

276
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,443
Huh?

277
00:18:34,544 --> 00:18:36,009
Oh...

278
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:38,616
What kind of stupid-ass...?

279
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,852
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

280
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,489
Who is she?

281
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:49,625
Who are you guys? Huh?

282
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,594
Okay, what the hell?

283
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:53,430
God! Oh, my God!

284
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,864
- Get off of me!
- I am suing...

285
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:57,534
- What's wrong with my voice?
- Get off of me!

286
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,939
- Where am I?
- You're crushing me! Get off!

287
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,643
Get...

288
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,616
What the hell?
What happened to the rest of me?

289
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,152
What is this?
What is this on my back?

290
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,152
What is this?

291
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,623
Oh, my God.

292
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,625
Fridge?

293
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,929
Yeah, I'm Fridge.
Who are you?

294
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,466
I'm Spencer.

295
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:32,038
What? The hell you are.
What is going on? Huh?

296
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,839
I think...

297
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,040
we're in the game.

298
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,477
- Sorry, excuse me?
- What are you talking about?

299
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,078
Somehow, I don't know how...

300
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,482
I think we got, like,
sucked into the game.

301
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:44,652
And we've become the avatars
that we chose.

302
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:48,188
So it's me, Spencer,
but yet I look and sound...

303
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,396
like Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

304
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,768
You're telling me
that you're Spencer?

305
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,670
Yes, yes, yes. That's it.

306
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:05,541
Fridge, I'm Spencer.
Which means you're Moose Finbar.

307
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:07,880
It says it right there
on your vest. And...

308
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,612
- Martha?
- Yeah.

309
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:12,814
You're Ruby Roundhouse.

310
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:16,620
And, Bethany,
you're Professor Shelly Oberon.

311
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,554
Only Shelly must be
short for Sheldon.

312
00:20:18,556 --> 00:20:19,822
What are you talking about?

313
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:21,859
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's right.

314
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:24,127
And you...

315
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:26,196
you're Spencer? You?

316
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:27,731
Yes. Guys, I'm telling you.

317
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,101
I am Spencer. I'm... Aah!

318
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,602
Yep, that's Spencer.

319
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:33,137
Whoa. Whoa!

320
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:35,707
So that means I...

321
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,044
I'm...

322
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:40,645
Wait, Bethany.
Bethany, don't!

323
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:43,484
No!

324
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:48,956
I'm an overweight,
middle-aged man.

325
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,658
Uh, I have a tattoo.

326
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,527
My mom always said she'd
kill me if I ever got a tattoo.

327
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:55,895
What is this?

328
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:57,599
I have one too.

329
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,268
Sometimes.

330
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,637
Wait a second.

331
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,106
Where's my phone?

332
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:09,544
Aah.

333
00:21:09,546 --> 00:21:11,613
Why am I wearing this outfit
in a jungle?

334
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:14,015
Tiny, little shorts
and a leather halter top.

335
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:15,584
I mean, what is this?

336
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:17,952
I look like a living
garden gnome. Where is my phone?

337
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:20,556
- Who cares?
- We are in different bodies!

338
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,990
It doesn't seem like
the most pressing concern

339
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:24,926
- at this moment.
- Really? You don't think

340
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:26,994
this would be a good moment
to make a call

341
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:28,897
or text somebody
or change your status

342
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:30,232
to "stuck in
a video game"?

343
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:33,636
All I'm saying is,
I don't have my Claritin, okay?

344
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:35,572
And I'm allergic to
almost everything.

345
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:36,905
Oh, no.

346
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:39,643
You got allergies,
Spencer? Huh?

347
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:41,645
I don't have the top two feet
of my body!

348
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,348
You guys, this can't
actually be happening.

349
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,916
Maybe we're all in a coma.

350
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:49,887
Together?
We're all in a coma together?

351
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:52,188
It's the only explanation.
That old game machine

352
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,693
must have electrocuted us,
and now we're...

353
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:59,697
- Oh, my God, Bethany!
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!

354
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:01,066
Stop it!

355
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:10,943
Oh, my God! You better get
in there and go save her.

356
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:12,844
I'm not getting in there!
You get in.

357
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:14,880
I'm not going anywhere.
I got a backpack on.

358
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:17,618
You don't get in water with a
backpack. Everybody knows that.

359
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,892
Ow!

360
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,094
What the...?

361
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,700
- Bethany!
- What just...?

362
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,334
Are you okay?

363
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:35,702
That was so intense.

364
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:37,672
I, like, can't even
with this place.

365
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:39,975
- What just happened to you?
- I got eaten by a rhino,

366
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:42,710
and then I fell, like,
a thousand feet from the sky.

367
00:22:42,712 --> 00:22:44,412
Yeah, that's what
it looked like.

368
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,316
That was a hippo.
They're omnivorous.

369
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,816
They're fast as a horse
over short distances,

370
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:51,188
and they have the bite force
of 8100 newtons.

371
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:53,122
How do I know this?

372
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:54,658
You're an expert in zoology.

373
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,425
- What?
- I'm still an old fat guy, right?

374
00:22:56,427 --> 00:22:58,961
- I'm afraid so.
- Wait.

375
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:03,233
Why is everybody okay with this?
I mean, she fell out of the sky.

376
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:04,838
Um, guys?

377
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:12,443
Bethany, get up.
Bethany, get up. Get up!

378
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:19,785
Go, go, go!

379
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:21,987
Go, go, go!

380
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:28,897
Ah! Dr. Bravestone!
Welcome to Jumanji!

381
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:33,300
Don't just stand there.
In you go.

382
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:35,068
- Go, go, go.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:48,382
Dr. Bravestone.

384
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:51,418
Famed archaeologist
and international explorer.

385
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,053
Known across
the seven continents

386
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:54,923
for your courageous exploits.

387
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:56,890
Is there a seat belt?

388
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:59,994
I can't tell you what an honor
it is to finally meet you.

389
00:23:59,996 --> 00:24:03,331
I'm not embarrassed to say
you're more dashing in person.

390
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,367
Um, thanks.

391
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:06,468
Who are you?

392
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,103
Nigel Billingsly
at your service,

393
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:10,372
Ruby Roundhouse,
killer of men.

394
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:12,073
Welcome to Jumanji.

395
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,312
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

396
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:17,413
As you know,
Jumanji is in grave danger.

397
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,317
We're counting on the four
of you to lift the curse.

398
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,052
- Curse?
- What curse?

399
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:25,222
Excuse me.
Have you seen my phone anywhere?

400
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:27,824
Professor Sheldon Oberon.

401
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:29,360
Welcome to Jumanji.

402
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:31,295
Nigel Billingsly
at your service.

403
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:33,898
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

404
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,433
What's with this guy?

405
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:37,236
I think he's an NPC.

406
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:38,770
A what? English, please.

407
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:40,873
A non-player character.
He's part of the game.

408
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,240
So anything we ask him,

409
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:44,543
he only has his programmed
series of responses.

410
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:46,278
Got it. It's all clear now.

411
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,480
Franklin "Mouse" Finbar.

412
00:24:48,482 --> 00:24:50,047
Welcome to Jumanji.

413
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:51,884
It's Moose. It's not Mouse.

414
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:54,386
No, good sir.
I'm quite sure it's Mouse.

415
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:55,954
- Mouse?
- A nickname given

416
00:24:55,956 --> 00:24:58,825
for your diminutive stature
and adorable manner.

417
00:24:58,827 --> 00:24:59,992
I knew you'd be here.

418
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:01,827
Dr. Bravestone
doesn't go anywhere

419
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:03,530
without his trusty sidekick.

420
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:05,131
Sidekick?

421
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:07,134
Ever since Dr. Bravestone
rescued you

422
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:08,536
from the clutches
of a warlord

423
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:11,373
in the jungles of Peru,
you've never left his side.

424
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,540
Right.

425
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,276
Can we go back
to the curse thing?

426
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,811
It's all documented
in the letter I sent you.

427
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:18,413
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

428
00:25:18,415 --> 00:25:19,984
I don't have a let...

429
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,388
Whoa.

430
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:29,959
Right, uh...

431
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,295
"Dr. Bravestone,
I am writing to you

432
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,397
"regarding
the desperate situation

433
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,200
In Jumanji.
We need your help at once."

434
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,168
<i>- Whoa... Guys?
- What's happening?</i>

435
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,138
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

436
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,507
<i>It's a cut scene.
A lot of games have them.</i>

437
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,311
<i>It's like a little movie
to tell you the back-story.</i>

438
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,414
<i>My name is
Nigel Billingsly,</i>

439
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:51,916
<i>Jumanji field guide.</i>

440
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,985
<i>I was hired
by your former partner,</i>

441
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:56,620
<i>now nemesis,
Professor Russel Van Pelt</i>

442
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,360
<i>to lead
a fateful expedition.</i>

443
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,128
<i>You see,
Professor Van Pelt</i>

444
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,465
<i>had come in search
of the fabled Jaguar Shrine,</i>

445
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:10,134
<i>resting place
of the sacred jewel of Jumanji.</i>

446
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,170
<i>As you know
better than anyone,</i>

447
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,005
<i>the jewel was his
great obsession.</i>

448
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,207
<i>And after years of research,
he believed</i>

449
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,210
<i>that he had discovered
its whereabouts.</i>

450
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:19,979
Could it be?

451
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:22,082
Have I finally found it?

452
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:25,286
<i>Van Pelt told me that
he wanted to find the jewel</i>

453
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:27,989
<i>in order to document it
in his writings.</i>

454
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:32,559
- It's real!
<i>- What I did not know</i>

455
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:36,400
<i>was that he intended
to take the jewel for himself.</i>

456
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:47,976
I found it.

457
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:52,116
I found it!

458
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:57,120
<i>Legend tells that the
Jaguar watches over Jumanji</i>

459
00:26:57,122 --> 00:26:59,289
<i>and anyone who dares
to blind him</i>

460
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:02,862
<i>will be consumed
by a dark power.</i>

461
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:05,996
<i>Van Pelt assumed dominion</i>

462
00:27:05,998 --> 00:27:08,097
<i>over all
of Jumanji's creatures,</i>

463
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:11,403
<i>possessing them,
controlling them.</i>

464
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:16,009
<i>And a terrible curse befell
this once-placid land.</i>

465
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,443
<i>I begged him
to put it back,</i>

466
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:21,578
<i>but once he had it
in his grasp,</i>

467
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,384
<i>he could never let it go.</i>

468
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:28,521
<i>So I waited
till they slept that night,</i>

469
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:30,259
<i>and I made my move.</i>

470
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:54,448
Bring me that jewel!

471
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,054
And slaughter anyone
who tries to stop you.

472
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,125
Right, then. Here you go.

473
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:04,994
With the invaluable help
of your associates,

474
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,762
you must use your
complementary skills

475
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:08,730
to return the jewel
to the Jaguar's eye

476
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:11,100
and lift the curse.

477
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:13,436
I'm sure you'll want
to get started right away.

478
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:15,337
- Actually, I think...
- Good luck!

479
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:17,474
The fate of Jumanji
is in your hands.

480
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:21,143
- What? Oh...
- And remember:

481
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:23,381
<i>The goal for you,
I'll recite in verse</i>

482
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:26,016
<i>Return the jewel
and lift the curse</i>

483
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:27,584
<i>If you wish
to leave the game</i>

484
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:32,155
<i>You must save Jumanji
And call out its name</i>

485
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:35,125
Good luck! The fate
of Jumanji is in your hands.

486
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:37,461
- And remember:
- He's saying the same thing over.

487
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:39,095
<i>I'll recite in verse</i>

488
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:41,232
<i>Return the jewel
and lift the curse</i>

489
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:42,433
<i>If you wish
to leave the game</i>

490
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:46,507
<i>You must save Jumanji
And call out its name</i>

491
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:53,178
It's okay. You can handle this.
In real life, people love you.

492
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,713
You can hook up
with anyone you want.

493
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:57,384
Is that what you tell yourself
when you're scared?

494
00:28:57,386 --> 00:28:59,751
Can you not judge me
for two seconds?

495
00:28:59,753 --> 00:29:01,789
I split up with Noah,
I turned into a guy,

496
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:04,524
and I cannot find my phone.
I am allowed to be upset.

497
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:07,661
Dr. Bravestone,
here's a map of Jumanji.

498
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,432
You must go to the bazaar
and find the missing piece.

499
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:12,500
- The bazaar.
- Missing piece of what?

500
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,502
- Cheerio!
- You can't give us a ride

501
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,471
- to the statue?
- And remember:

502
00:29:16,473 --> 00:29:18,440
<i>If you wish
to leave the game</i>

503
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:22,381
<i>You must save Jumanji
And call out its name</i>

504
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,188
- You want to, uh, put this in there?
- No.

505
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,261
Come on, you're the only one
with a backpack, Fridge.

506
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:38,829
So what? We have a map.

507
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:40,830
So now we're supposed
to go and find...?

508
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:42,331
The bazaar, I guess?

509
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,268
So we return the jewel
to the Jaguar statue,

510
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,803
and then we go home.
No problem.

511
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:49,739
Why can't we just leave,
stop the game,

512
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:51,809
without doing
all this stuff?

513
00:29:51,811 --> 00:29:54,314
We have to finish the game.

514
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:57,218
I think...

515
00:29:58,384 --> 00:30:01,321
I think we
have to save Jumanji.

516
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:12,401
Damn, that is a man
right there.

517
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:18,805
Don't
cry, don't cry, don't cry.

518
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:19,872
Don't cry.

519
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:21,342
Ah...

520
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:24,143
There are so many diseases
out here.

521
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:25,578
It's hot.

522
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,815
Okay, this is
what I'm good at.

523
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:30,217
Playing video games.
It's what I do.

524
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,486
It's literally
the main thing that I do.

525
00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:34,555
Play a game like this,
there'll be levels.

526
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:37,358
In order to finish, you gotta
complete all the levels.

527
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,426
Levels are gonna get harder
as we go along.

528
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:40,895
- We complete the levels...
- Do you

529
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:42,730
even know
where we're going?

530
00:30:42,732 --> 00:30:44,598
- Kind of.
- Kind of?

531
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,502
Oh, that's good, then.
We're in good hands.

532
00:30:47,504 --> 00:30:50,373
Okay, the missing piece,
I'm guessing.

533
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,240
That must be
what we're looking for,

534
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:53,509
the missing piece
of the map.

535
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:55,547
The problem is,
there's nothing here.

536
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:01,251
What do you mean?
It's a map, just like he said.

537
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:02,655
It's a map of Jumanji.

538
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:05,422
Cartography.

539
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:07,424
- What's that?
- The study of maps.

540
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:09,559
It was one of
Professor Oberon's skills.

541
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:10,761
Yes. That's right.

542
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:13,397
Oh, so you can't see this,
but I can?

543
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:15,966
The characters we chose,
we all have certain skills.

544
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,969
So there's gotta be
a way to access our...

545
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,141
Oh!

546
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:23,774
Wow.

547
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:25,276
What'd you just do?

548
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:27,545
"Strengths:
Fearless. Climbing.

549
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:29,415
Speed. Boomerang.

550
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:31,916
Smoldering intensity."

551
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:37,523
What the hell are you doing?

552
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:40,630
- What just happened?
- Um, you just smoldered.

553
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:43,332
"Weakness.

554
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:45,931
None"?

555
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:48,668
How'd you do that?
That, uh, list?

556
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,873
Well, I just... I think I just
pressed my enormous left pec.

557
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,311
It's like the boob area.
Let me show you.

558
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:57,511
Get away from me.

559
00:31:57,513 --> 00:31:59,314
At least press it
in front of us...

560
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,449
...so we know exactly how...

561
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:06,354
"Strengths: Karate. T'ai chi.
Aikido. Dance fighting"?

562
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:08,724
Dance fighting?
Is that even a thing?

563
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,592
"Weakness:

564
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:11,860
Venom."

565
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,599
Seriously?

566
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,003
"Paleontology."
What does that even mean?

567
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:22,738
Study of fossils, I think.

568
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,709
- That's kind of cool.
- Says the gorgeous karate badass

569
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,612
to the old fossil guy
who doesn't have any endurance.

570
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,718
I hate this game.

571
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,987
"Weakness: Cake."

572
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:40,024
Yes, cake is my weakness.

573
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:42,727
Along with speed
and strength.

574
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:43,761
Huh...

575
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:45,630
Strength is my weakness.

576
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,999
Hey, can I...?
Quick question.

577
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,800
How is strength my weakness?

578
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,937
Somebody explain that to me.
And why would I need speed?

579
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:55,641
Why would I need to be fast
when I'm being chased

580
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:59,413
by an enormous killer zebra or
some shit in this dumb-ass hat?

581
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:01,781
You're also
a good weapons valet.

582
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,951
- What does that mean?
- Well, I think it means

583
00:33:04,953 --> 00:33:06,787
you carry my weapons
in your backpack,

584
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:10,527
and you give them to me
when and if I need them?

585
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:15,862
You guys. The map,
it's changing.

586
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:17,064
What do you mean?

587
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,666
- What's it say?
- Okay, well,

588
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:20,100
there's not
a lot of information.

589
00:33:20,102 --> 00:33:23,070
But a minute ago, it didn't
say this and now it does.

590
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:26,542
It says,
"The Mighty Roar."

591
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:35,917
I don't like that.

592
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,852
- I'm done.
- What else?

593
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:41,757
Okay. And right here,
it says "From The Deep."

594
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,060
The hippo came from the deep.
The one that...

595
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:47,531
Yes, the thing that did
the thing. That's it. Moving on.

596
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,734
So if "From The Deep"
is the first level,

597
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,669
then "The Mighty Roar" must be
the second level.

598
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:54,705
Which way?

599
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:56,107
Okay.

600
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:58,578
If that is that...

601
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:02,383
and that is here...

602
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,882
Right here, I think.

603
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:19,667
What is this game?

604
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:22,704
Run!

605
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:26,508
Wait!

606
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:32,848
Ha!

607
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:45,663
Come on, legs!

608
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:50,401
Why am I running so slow?

609
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,942
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

610
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,915
Aah!
This sucks!

611
00:35:06,118 --> 00:35:07,786
Split up!

612
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:23,471
Oh, my God.

613
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:40,722
Aah!

614
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,124
Whoa.

615
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,560
Come on!

616
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,263
- Those guys have huge guns.
- Oh, really?

617
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:50,830
Is that what
those are, Spencer?

618
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:52,665
- Let me see your backpack.
- For what?

619
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,868
Inside your backpack,
you have my weapons.

620
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,006
Get down.

621
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,242
Got your weapons?

622
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:03,744
I can't feel no...
What's this?

623
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,046
Oh, yes. Boomerang,
it's one of my strengths.

624
00:36:06,048 --> 00:36:07,581
What are you gonna do with it?

625
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,117
I don't know.
Kill them, I guess.

626
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,150
Kill them with that?

627
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:11,254
You got a better idea?

628
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:12,856
Oh, watch yourself.

629
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,190
Watch this.

630
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:21,564
- Nice work.
- There!

631
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:23,300
Want me to see
if I got a hacky sack

632
00:36:23,302 --> 00:36:25,572
for you to throw
and do nothing with?

633
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,316
Oh!

634
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:42,020
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, no.

635
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:48,629
It worked.

636
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,864
Here they come. We gotta go.

637
00:36:51,866 --> 00:36:53,634
I can't outrun those guys.

638
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:56,768
We gotta go now!

639
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,804
- Get on my back.
- I would rather die.

640
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:00,339
- Jump on my back!
- Nope. I'll die.

641
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:02,074
Put me down!

642
00:37:02,076 --> 00:37:04,814
Spencer! Put me down!

643
00:37:14,223 --> 00:37:16,924
Whew!

644
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:19,596
You have got
to be kidding me.

645
00:37:20,663 --> 00:37:23,033
Oh, no, no, no!

646
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,070
- We have to jump!
- Are you out of your mind?

647
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,372
I would rather do
anything else now but that.

648
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,375
Jump!

649
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,277
- Martha!
- Jump!

650
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:38,815
We gotta jump!

651
00:37:38,817 --> 00:37:40,949
We don't know
how deep that water is.

652
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:42,819
- We gotta go!
- No, no!

653
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:46,692
- You gonna jump. Jump!
- No!

654
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:06,977
Oh! I think
I'm having a coronary.

655
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:08,712
I'm having difficulty
breathing.

656
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:11,416
That was the most
humiliating moment of my life.

657
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:13,418
Don't you do that again.

658
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,253
I took in a lot of water.

659
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:22,094
They got me.

660
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:23,864
Oh, no.

661
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:26,602
Martha?

662
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:36,011
- Wait, what just happened to her?
- Is she dead? Did she die?

663
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:40,882
Wait a second.

664
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:43,117
What the hell is hap...?

665
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,285
Ow!

666
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:46,154
- Get off of my back!
- Are you okay?

667
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:48,222
- I think so.
- Off of me!

668
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:50,891
- Goodness gracious, get off!
- I'm getting off of you.

669
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:52,126
Anybody care if I'm okay?

670
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:54,164
What am I,
a human landing pad?

671
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:58,435
That's what I thought.

672
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,035
We each have
three lives, guys.

673
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,937
These little tattoos
on our arms...

674
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:05,474
Jesus, would you look
at the size of that thing?

675
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,244
- Spencer!
- What?

676
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:10,714
- You were saying?
- It's our life count.

677
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:14,016
Bethany got eaten by a hippo,
so now she only has two lines.

678
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,285
He's right.

679
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:18,791
Wait. What happens
if we use up all our lives?

680
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:22,662
Well, usually
that would mean...

681
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:25,429
...game over.

682
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,164
What do you mean,
"game over"?

683
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,935
Are you saying that
we can actually die in here?

684
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:31,803
I mean, I don't know
for sure, but...

685
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:33,305
You're not sure?
You're not sure,

686
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:36,242
- Mr. Video-Game-Genius?
- I've never been stuck in one!

687
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:41,514
So I'm not certain, but, yes,
I'm afraid we all could die.

688
00:39:43,485 --> 00:39:46,021
That is my big concern
right now.

689
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:52,526
We better find
the missing piece, then.

690
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:54,698
Okay.

691
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:58,799
It looks like
there's a village

692
00:39:58,801 --> 00:40:00,501
on the other side
of this mountain.

693
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:02,537
Maybe that's the bazaar.

694
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:05,009
- Let's do it.
- Wait.

695
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,075
I gotta take a leak first.

696
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:11,247
I've been
dreading this all day,

697
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:13,847
but so do I.

698
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:16,988
Can I come with you
and you show me how it's done?

699
00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:20,355
I may need your help.

700
00:40:20,357 --> 00:40:26,162
Uh, yeah, sure.
Yeah, I'm... I'll help you out.

701
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
So how do we do this?

702
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:32,434
Uh. Easy.
You just, uh...

703
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:34,871
You unzip, take it out,
fire away.

704
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:38,846
Remember to aim.
It's very important.

705
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:43,446
My God, you guys,
there is literally a penis

706
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:44,948
attached to my body
right now.

707
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,551
Martha,
come look at my penis!

708
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:48,353
No, thanks.

709
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:51,189
- This the first you've seen it?
- Yes. I didn't wanna look.

710
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,891
I looked at mine
the first 20 seconds here.

711
00:40:53,893 --> 00:40:55,360
I'm happy to report
that I was able

712
00:40:55,362 --> 00:40:57,898
to bring one thing
from the outside world.

713
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:00,566
Are you...? What are you doing?

714
00:41:00,568 --> 00:41:01,933
- Are you looking?
- Sorry.

715
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:03,201
You don't look over!

716
00:41:03,203 --> 00:41:05,437
Yeah, you never look.
It's a thing.

717
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:07,339
Okay, good boy.

718
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,342
We're gonna take this
nice and slow,

719
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:10,609
and nobody's gonna get hurt.

720
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:12,413
- Now what?
- Now blast off.

721
00:41:12,415 --> 00:41:13,912
And aim.
Don't forget to aim.

722
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:16,015
What is with you and aiming?
What happened?

723
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,618
Can we not talk about this?

724
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,520
Wow, wow, wow!

725
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,922
Oh, this is
so much easier!

726
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:24,425
It's cool, right?

727
00:41:24,427 --> 00:41:27,060
Yeah, because you have,
like, a handle.

728
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:29,530
The fact that I'm not
Instagramming this

729
00:41:29,532 --> 00:41:31,234
right now is insane.

730
00:41:34,104 --> 00:41:36,204
- This looks all right.
- Up ahead!

731
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:58,095
Bravestone.

732
00:41:58,097 --> 00:42:00,166
Him and that whole lot.

733
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:02,870
They got away?

734
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:05,238
We lost them in the jungle.

735
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,008
I should have known.

736
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,011
H-how do you mean, sir?

737
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:16,282
I will summon every creature
and every soldier

738
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,349
to hunt them down.

739
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:21,088
Reclaim what is mine.

740
00:42:24,426 --> 00:42:25,861
Find them.

741
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:31,430
Be careful
of the ground, guys.

742
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:34,167
It's uneven. I'd hate
for anybody to twist an ankle.

743
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:36,337
- I did that once...
- Please stop talking?

744
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:38,939
- Okay, sure. No problem.
- Please!

745
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:40,641
- Can I borrow your jacket?
- Yeah, sure.

746
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:42,143
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?

747
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:44,411
I feel like I'm wearing
a bikini at school.

748
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,681
I did that once.
They sent me to the office.

749
00:42:46,683 --> 00:42:48,114
Of course.

750
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:49,983
Noah likes it
when I show some skin.

751
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,687
It's like the key
to our relationship.

752
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:53,421
Ew.

753
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:57,293
Judgy much? Seriously, I can't
even open my mouth around you.

754
00:42:57,295 --> 00:43:00,697
You don't even know me, but you,
like, decided you hate me.

755
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:03,201
Oh, wait a minute.
I don't hate you.

756
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:07,270
- You don't?
- No.

757
00:43:07,272 --> 00:43:09,572
Look, I just think
you live in, like,

758
00:43:09,574 --> 00:43:11,040
the "hot popular girl"
bubble.

759
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:12,608
Where everybody
either treats you

760
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,678
like a princess
or like an object.

761
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,920
Maybe it makes you a little...
self-absorbed or something?

762
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:24,988
That's fair.

763
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,090
But do you think maybe
the reason why you're

764
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:29,594
so judgy is because
you're, like, afraid that

765
00:43:29,596 --> 00:43:31,062
people aren't gonna
like you,

766
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:33,130
so you decide
not to like them first?

767
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:35,169
No.

768
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:39,039
Maybe. Maybe.

769
00:43:40,006 --> 00:43:42,207
Okay, then.

770
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,079
I'm just saying,
you're a babe. Own it.

771
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,713
Thanks.

772
00:43:48,715 --> 00:43:50,683
I guess.

773
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:00,494
So sick of this game.
Just stay out of my way, Spencer.

774
00:44:00,496 --> 00:44:02,329
What are you mad at me for?

775
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:04,465
Why? Are you
seriously asking me that?

776
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,266
You got me
kicked off the team.

777
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,503
Then you got me stuck in
whatever... Whatever this is.

778
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:11,540
And you wonder
why we not friends no more.

779
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:13,475
This is why
we're not friends anymore?

780
00:44:13,477 --> 00:44:16,310
You didn't wanna get stuck
in Jumanji? I don't think so.

781
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:18,446
We're not friends
because I'm not cool enough

782
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,381
to hang out with you,
so you pretended

783
00:44:20,383 --> 00:44:22,618
not to even know me anymore,
until you needed me

784
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,288
to do your homework because
you couldn't do it yourself.

785
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,822
No wonder
you don't know anything

786
00:44:26,824 --> 00:44:28,224
about westward expansion.

787
00:44:28,226 --> 00:44:30,592
Okay, you see that?
You know what?

788
00:44:30,594 --> 00:44:32,195
I'm not stupid,
Spencer.

789
00:44:32,197 --> 00:44:34,265
I asked you to do me
one simple favor.

790
00:44:34,267 --> 00:44:35,632
Do my homework, so I don't

791
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:38,234
get kicked off the team,
and you messed that up.

792
00:44:38,236 --> 00:44:40,537
Now I can't do the one thing
that I'm good at,

793
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:42,807
and it's all your fault.

794
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:45,246
I should kick
the shit out you right now.

795
00:44:53,487 --> 00:44:54,619
I'd like to see you try.

796
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:56,024
What did you say?

797
00:44:57,824 --> 00:45:00,292
Oh, okay.

798
00:45:00,294 --> 00:45:01,826
I see what's going on here.

799
00:45:01,828 --> 00:45:03,463
Guys.

800
00:45:03,465 --> 00:45:05,832
You think because you...
You, what, 6'4 ", 6'5",

801
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:07,365
270 pounds of pure muscle,

802
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:09,135
I'm supposed
to be afraid of you?

803
00:45:09,137 --> 00:45:10,507
Is that what you think?

804
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:13,175
Maybe.

805
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:19,313
Let me tell you something.

806
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:21,114
You're still
the same annoying kid

807
00:45:21,116 --> 00:45:23,453
I've been trying to shake
since seventh grade.

808
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:26,253
Ain't nothing changed.

809
00:45:26,255 --> 00:45:29,456
Don't let this new body
get your butt whupped.

810
00:45:34,764 --> 00:45:36,234
Dumb-ass.

811
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,839
- No!
- Spencer!

812
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,674
Spencer!

813
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,278
- You killed him!
- Fridge, you lunatic!

814
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,450
Chill out. He'll be back.

815
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:10,136
Don't call me a dumb-ass.

816
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:13,203
Don't push me.

817
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:14,605
Or what, Spencer?

818
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:16,477
Or I'll push you back.

819
00:46:24,884 --> 00:46:26,387
- Oh!
- Oh!

820
00:46:28,957 --> 00:46:30,493
Did you just smack me?

821
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:33,560
You gonna smack me?

822
00:46:33,562 --> 00:46:36,963
- Fridge, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

823
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:38,699
Huh? You wanna smack...?

824
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:41,403
Oh, no, no, no!

825
00:46:42,572 --> 00:46:43,572
Enough.

826
00:46:44,806 --> 00:46:46,510
We can't waste lives.

827
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,211
We need each other.

828
00:46:49,213 --> 00:46:53,747
Like it or not,
we have to do this together.

829
00:46:56,954 --> 00:46:58,787
Could you say that
one more time, please?

830
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:01,623
- We have to do this together?
- But with the smolder.

831
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:05,493
Do you have control of that,
or does that happen naturally?

832
00:47:05,495 --> 00:47:07,496
It just happens naturally.

833
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,329
What are we supposed
to be doing?

834
00:47:38,331 --> 00:47:39,898
Looking for
the missing map piece.

835
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,599
So we just start
asking for it?

836
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:44,270
No, I think we look around,
scope the place out,

837
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:46,339
but most importantly, guys,

838
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:48,243
be discreet.

839
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,745
Rations! Get your rations!

840
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:54,446
Does anyone have any money?
I'm literally starving.

841
00:47:54,448 --> 00:47:57,584
Rations! Get your rations!

842
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:59,718
Rations!

843
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,988
Guys, I think the game
is trying to tell us

844
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,055
to keep our health up.

845
00:48:03,057 --> 00:48:05,025
We need to eat.

846
00:48:05,027 --> 00:48:06,760
Okay, stop doing that.

847
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,362
Oh, my God, this is so good.

848
00:48:08,364 --> 00:48:10,365
I haven't had bread
since I was, like, 9.

849
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:11,499
Are you serious?

850
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:13,602
How do you think
I got these abs?

851
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:15,540
Let me try some of that.

852
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:18,242
Mm.

853
00:48:19,475 --> 00:48:21,810
Wait, what...?
What is this?

854
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:23,078
That's my famous pound cake.

855
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,315
Cake?

856
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:27,784
Bethany, you said
this was bread.

857
00:48:27,786 --> 00:48:30,386
It's been so long,
I forgot what it tastes like.

858
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:31,853
How do you forget what...?

859
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:34,056
What's hap...
Something happening to me?

860
00:48:34,058 --> 00:48:35,591
- No.
- Am I... Am I shaking?

861
00:48:35,593 --> 00:48:37,059
- Huh-uh.
- Am I breaking out?

862
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:38,927
No.

863
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:41,096
- Am I still black?
- Yes.

864
00:48:41,098 --> 00:48:44,801
Okay. Okay, right?

865
00:48:44,803 --> 00:48:46,970
We're fine.
Everything is fine.

866
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:48,473
Yeah, no, no, no,
it's okay.

867
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:50,442
It probably just meant
that I love cake.

868
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:52,409
That I couldn't resist it.
Yeah.

869
00:48:52,411 --> 00:48:54,511
Hey, it's all good...

870
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:09,095
God!

871
00:49:09,097 --> 00:49:11,997
Oh! Ow!

872
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:13,770
What the hell? Ugh!

873
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:17,002
Like I said,
important to be discreet.

874
00:49:17,004 --> 00:49:18,471
Hey, you also said eat.

875
00:49:18,473 --> 00:49:20,107
Rations!
Get your...

876
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:21,744
You better
shut your ass up!

877
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:25,846
Dr. Bravestone.
Thank goodness you're here.

878
00:49:25,848 --> 00:49:27,047
Jumanji needs you.

879
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:30,784
Uh. Thanks. Good to be here.

880
00:49:30,786 --> 00:49:32,452
Ask about
the missing piece.

881
00:49:32,454 --> 00:49:34,588
Oh, right.
Hi. I'm Bethany.

882
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,759
I mean...
Professor Shelly, something.

883
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:39,159
I'm a map doctor,

884
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:42,730
and I have this map that,
like, has a missing piece.

885
00:49:42,732 --> 00:49:45,100
Dr. Bravestone.
Thank goodness you're here.

886
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:46,436
Jumanji needs you.

887
00:49:46,438 --> 00:49:47,703
Rude.

888
00:49:47,705 --> 00:49:50,476
We need to find
the missing piece.

889
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:27,647
<i>What you need
is in the basket</i>

890
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,450
<i>One false move,
you're in a casket</i>

891
00:50:30,452 --> 00:50:33,785
<i>Trust one another,
and never blink</i>

892
00:50:33,787 --> 00:50:37,627
<i>The missing piece
is not what you think</i>

893
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:39,992
Oy vey.

894
00:50:39,994 --> 00:50:41,895
Good luck, mighty hero.

895
00:50:41,897 --> 00:50:44,197
- Jumanji needs you.
- Jumanji needs him. We know.

896
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:46,403
You said it several times.

897
00:50:51,807 --> 00:50:55,776
So thinking there's a, um...

898
00:50:55,778 --> 00:50:58,246
A snake in there
or something?

899
00:50:58,248 --> 00:50:59,680
Yep.

900
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,583
Sounds like
a Bravestone thing to me.

901
00:51:01,585 --> 00:51:03,486
Why would this be
a Bravestone thing?

902
00:51:03,488 --> 00:51:05,254
You're the hero.
You heard what he said.

903
00:51:05,256 --> 00:51:06,857
"Jumanji needs you."
Now, get.

904
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:24,509
I don't wanna do this!

905
00:51:24,511 --> 00:51:25,676
Just go.

906
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:48,567
Black mamba!

907
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:50,537
That's a black mamba.

908
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:53,070
A quarter milligram of its venom
is enough to kill an adult.

909
00:51:53,072 --> 00:51:55,274
You'll feel a tingling
in your mouth and extremities,

910
00:51:55,276 --> 00:51:57,810
followed by a fever, foaming
at the mouth, and ataxia,

911
00:51:57,812 --> 00:51:59,579
which means
loss of muscle control.

912
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:01,147
- How do I know that?
- What do we do?

913
00:52:01,149 --> 00:52:03,617
- See anything else in there?
- I didn't have time.

914
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:05,018
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

915
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,721
"Trust one another
and never blink." Never blink.

916
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:10,791
You guys, I think
it's a staring contest.

917
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:12,294
- What?
- What are you talking about?

918
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,229
- Think about it. "Never blink"?
- Guys, I think she's right.

919
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,897
At camp,
they used to tell us

920
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:19,200
if you see a rattlesnake,
don't move. I think someone

921
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,903
has to make direct eye contact
and not blink.

922
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,838
And then Spencer
will reach in and grab

923
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,308
- whatever else is in there.
- What? Why me again?

924
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,643
- Because you're Bravestone.
- Okay, fine.

925
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:32,016
Who's good at staring
and not blinking?

926
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:35,218
I'm amazing at it.

927
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,186
Then this is your moment.

928
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:42,661
Come on, Bethany.

929
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:48,535
Okay.

930
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:53,072
Just say when.

931
00:52:55,942 --> 00:52:57,044
Now.

932
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:07,285
Oh!

933
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:09,557
What do we do?

934
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:13,326
You gotta defang it.

935
00:53:13,328 --> 00:53:15,962
I gotta what?

936
00:53:15,964 --> 00:53:17,663
You gotta pull
his mouth back

937
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:19,632
from the blind spot
to disorient it.

938
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:21,634
But be very careful
of the venom gland

939
00:53:21,636 --> 00:53:23,736
and the exposed
secondary venom duct.

940
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,271
Then you gotta
snap its teeth...

941
00:53:27,844 --> 00:53:29,342
...out of its head.

942
00:53:29,344 --> 00:53:31,981
Oh, oh!

943
00:53:34,117 --> 00:53:36,851
I guess it wasn't
a staring contest.

944
00:53:36,853 --> 00:53:40,121
"Trust each other
and never blink."

945
00:53:40,123 --> 00:53:42,188
You trusted me.

946
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,392
You trusted me,
and I defanged the snake.

947
00:53:44,394 --> 00:53:46,329
I did it.
I did that.

948
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:48,964
Yeah.
Yeah, you did it.

949
00:53:48,966 --> 00:53:50,400
Thank you.

950
00:53:50,402 --> 00:53:53,005
Oh, yeah. Sure.

951
00:54:03,314 --> 00:54:04,948
You guys?

952
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,417
This does not look like
a piece of a map.

953
00:54:07,419 --> 00:54:10,854
The missing piece
is an elephant?

954
00:54:10,856 --> 00:54:13,823
Oh, wait, there's something
written on the wrapping paper.

955
00:54:13,825 --> 00:54:17,127
"When you see me,
begin the climb."

956
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:21,035
"Begin the climb"?
When you see an elephant?

957
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,036
I defanged a snake.

958
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,975
So keep your eyes
peeled for an elephant, I guess?

959
00:54:29,977 --> 00:54:32,244
That's, like,
the next level of the game?

960
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:39,920
Hey!

961
00:54:39,922 --> 00:54:41,224
Run!

962
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:47,793
Oh, God.

963
00:54:47,795 --> 00:54:49,832
Watch out!

964
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:53,267
Jump!

965
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:55,072
- Jump.
- Go, go, go!

966
00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:57,106
Hey!

967
00:55:03,346 --> 00:55:08,149
I have to warn you, I think
I'm a very strong puncher.

968
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:09,220
Parry.

969
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:13,054
Parry. Parry. Evade. Block.

970
00:55:13,056 --> 00:55:14,356
Uppercut.

971
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:19,265
Oh. Oh.

972
00:55:20,365 --> 00:55:22,097
Duck! Head smash!

973
00:55:24,337 --> 00:55:25,337
Kerpow!

974
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:30,206
Duck! Block!

975
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:31,712
Ka-blam!

976
00:55:33,111 --> 00:55:35,779
Evade! Punch!

977
00:55:35,781 --> 00:55:38,416
Wall toss!

978
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,822
That is insane.

979
00:55:48,329 --> 00:55:51,095
Let's do this.

980
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,097
Do what?

981
00:55:53,468 --> 00:55:56,171
Put... Put it
in my backpack.

982
00:55:57,205 --> 00:55:59,906
Dodge! Head slam!

983
00:55:59,908 --> 00:56:01,140
Throw through ceiling!

984
00:56:26,437 --> 00:56:28,904
Hello, doctor.

985
00:56:28,906 --> 00:56:31,009
Been a long time.

986
00:56:33,543 --> 00:56:37,316
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

987
00:56:38,517 --> 00:56:40,216
We just wanna go home.

988
00:56:45,324 --> 00:56:47,558
Come on! Come with me! Hurry!

989
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,925
Get him!

990
00:56:56,402 --> 00:56:57,871
Come on.

991
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,845
Down here.
Come on. Quick!

992
00:57:20,629 --> 00:57:22,094
Shh!

993
00:57:22,096 --> 00:57:23,463
Okay.

994
00:57:23,465 --> 00:57:26,467
I need you to follow me
and do exactly as I say.

995
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:29,336
Let's move.

996
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:32,072
Oh, my God, you guys,
I am so stoked you are here.

997
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,408
- You have no idea. So stoked.
- You are?

998
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,410
I mean, I saw you
guys in the bazaar,

999
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,245
and I thought
to myself, "No way."

1000
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,046
Then I was like,
yeah, that's...

1001
00:57:40,048 --> 00:57:41,986
Backs against the wall!

1002
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:44,988
Oh, my goodness!

1003
00:57:47,424 --> 00:57:49,126
Let's keep moving.

1004
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:52,661
- Watch your step in here.
- Um, who are you?

1005
00:57:52,663 --> 00:57:54,130
And who do you think
we are?

1006
00:57:54,132 --> 00:57:56,132
Right.
Sorry, okay, my bad.

1007
00:57:56,134 --> 00:57:58,199
Um. Let me back up
a little bit here.

1008
00:57:58,201 --> 00:58:00,370
Wait, are you the pilot?
"Seaplane" somebody?

1009
00:58:00,372 --> 00:58:02,305
- Yeah, that's me.
- Wait a minute.

1010
00:58:02,307 --> 00:58:04,374
You're the other
character that was taken.

1011
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:07,544
- So you're in the game too?
- Stay off the white bricks...

1012
00:58:07,546 --> 00:58:09,011
- What?
- And freeze.

1013
00:58:09,013 --> 00:58:10,680
- Aah!
- Oh!

1014
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:18,690
So gnarly.

1015
00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:21,296
This game sucks.

1016
00:58:23,396 --> 00:58:24,998
Hup!

1017
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:33,174
All right. Get this plank.

1018
00:58:37,545 --> 00:58:40,079
Follow me.

1019
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:42,614
Careful.
It's a horrible way to die.

1020
00:58:42,616 --> 00:58:44,920
Oh, God.

1021
00:58:46,488 --> 00:58:48,089
There you go. All right.

1022
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,365
Come on.

1023
00:58:57,766 --> 00:59:00,301
I got it, I got it.
I just defanged a snake.

1024
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,239
Give me
a little respect.

1025
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,345
Okay.

1026
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,960
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1027
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:28,535
Come on.

1028
00:59:41,213 --> 00:59:44,114
Anyway, I'm Alex.

1029
00:59:44,116 --> 00:59:46,184
Spencer Gilpin.

1030
00:59:46,186 --> 00:59:49,287
Martha, Fridge and Bethany.

1031
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:51,656
Bethany? You're a girl?

1032
00:59:51,658 --> 00:59:54,225
Woman.

1033
00:59:54,227 --> 00:59:56,464
In real life, you'd probably
wanna hit that.

1034
01:00:03,272 --> 01:00:06,009
They got away.
Looks like they had help.

1035
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:08,775
Seaplane.

1036
01:00:08,777 --> 01:00:11,047
He must've crawled out
of his hole.

1037
01:00:12,215 --> 01:00:14,548
I'm sorry, boss.

1038
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,486
It won't happen again.

1039
01:00:19,456 --> 01:00:21,689
I know it won't.

1040
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:37,340
What are you making?

1041
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,508
Margaritas. It's actually
one of my strengths.

1042
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,244
That and piloting,
although I did get shot down

1043
01:00:42,246 --> 01:00:44,481
by a couple orangutans
in fighter jets,

1044
01:00:44,483 --> 01:00:46,619
so maybe not
that great at it.

1045
01:00:47,718 --> 01:00:49,652
Anyway, cheers.

1046
01:00:49,654 --> 01:00:51,422
Ah.

1047
01:00:51,424 --> 01:00:54,158
- Oh. Thanks.
- Sure.

1048
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,658
I've never
had alcohol before.

1049
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,728
- Me either.
- Know what?

1050
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:00,100
- What the hell? Woo!
- Lehayim.

1051
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:09,341
- And I'm done with that.
- It's good.

1052
01:01:09,343 --> 01:01:10,775
Can I get one more of those?

1053
01:01:10,777 --> 01:01:12,144
- Yeah.
- Alex?

1054
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:13,546
What's up with
all these candles?

1055
01:01:13,548 --> 01:01:15,448
ALEX? Citronella. One
of my weaknesses

1056
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:18,283
is mosquitoes,
which is kind of a bummer

1057
01:01:18,285 --> 01:01:20,719
when you live alone
in an open hut in the jungle.

1058
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,326
He's single.

1059
01:01:24,259 --> 01:01:25,592
Who's this?

1060
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:28,194
Who's Alan Parrish?

1061
01:01:28,196 --> 01:01:29,630
He's the guy
who built this place.

1062
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:32,599
Wait, other people have
been stuck here too?

1063
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,502
Yeah. This is Alan Parrish's
house. I'm just living in it.

1064
01:01:35,504 --> 01:01:37,638
So, Alex, tell me,

1065
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,307
how long have
you been in the game?

1066
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:41,808
Oh, it's tough to say.

1067
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,912
Time is kind of funny here.

1068
01:01:43,914 --> 01:01:45,380
But a few months, at least.

1069
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:46,781
- A few months?
- What?

1070
01:01:46,783 --> 01:01:48,284
Yeah,
I can't seem to make it

1071
01:01:48,286 --> 01:01:49,784
past the transportation shed.

1072
01:01:49,786 --> 01:01:51,753
Transportation shed?
What's that?

1073
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:53,489
It's the next level.

1074
01:01:53,491 --> 01:01:56,258
First time, my hot-air balloon
wouldn't even take off.

1075
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:59,163
And then there was the whole
plane thing I mentioned.

1076
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:03,899
And once I got down
to my last life,

1077
01:02:03,901 --> 01:02:05,769
I realized I was screwed.

1078
01:02:05,771 --> 01:02:08,604
And that I was never gonna
get out of here by myself.

1079
01:02:08,606 --> 01:02:11,576
Half the stuff that came at me,
I had zero way to deal with.

1080
01:02:11,578 --> 01:02:13,744
You can't kill a black mamba
with a margarita.

1081
01:02:13,746 --> 01:02:17,648
You sure can't.
You need a zoologist for that.

1082
01:02:19,419 --> 01:02:21,851
Alex, we can help each other.

1083
01:02:21,853 --> 01:02:24,456
You've been here a long time,
you know the game,

1084
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:26,557
and between us,
we have a lot of strengths.

1085
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,563
Yeah. We're actually
pretty good together.

1086
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:32,297
I don't know, bro.

1087
01:02:32,299 --> 01:02:35,601
Okay, I mess up
one more time, I'm toast.

1088
01:02:35,603 --> 01:02:37,636
Totally freaks me out
even thinking about

1089
01:02:37,638 --> 01:02:39,674
going back to
the transportation shed.

1090
01:02:41,643 --> 01:02:43,475
I don't wanna die
in Jumanji.

1091
01:02:43,477 --> 01:02:45,378
We just gotta stick together.

1092
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,483
If we do that, we can win.
I know we can.

1093
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:52,753
Oh, my God.
You're our missing piece.

1094
01:02:52,755 --> 01:02:54,822
You were the thing
we needed to find.

1095
01:02:54,824 --> 01:02:57,324
So the clue was to, what,

1096
01:02:57,326 --> 01:02:59,760
go to the bazaar
to find the missing piece?

1097
01:02:59,762 --> 01:03:01,598
It wasn't the elephant.

1098
01:03:03,466 --> 01:03:05,735
- It was me.
- Yeah.

1099
01:03:08,738 --> 01:03:11,440
Dudes, let's do this.

1100
01:03:11,442 --> 01:03:12,741
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1101
01:03:12,743 --> 01:03:15,278
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

1102
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,412
Hey, Spencer,
you gonna drink that margarita?

1103
01:03:17,414 --> 01:03:18,614
I... You're done.

1104
01:03:18,616 --> 01:03:20,882
This is one good margarita.

1105
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,727
There it is. The
transportation shed.

1106
01:03:31,729 --> 01:03:33,830
There's all sorts
of vehicles inside.

1107
01:03:33,832 --> 01:03:36,033
We gotta get one,
get across the canyon,

1108
01:03:36,035 --> 01:03:38,770
and get to the Jaguar statue.

1109
01:03:38,772 --> 01:03:40,804
Okay, I see
the transportation shed,

1110
01:03:40,806 --> 01:03:43,474
I see the canyon, but
I still can't see the statue,

1111
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:45,610
which is weird 'cause
it's the most important thing

1112
01:03:45,612 --> 01:03:46,844
in Jumanji and it's huge.

1113
01:03:46,846 --> 01:03:48,314
That's what she said.

1114
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:52,450
You drunk, Fridge?

1115
01:03:52,452 --> 01:03:54,519
What are you talking about?
I ain't drunk.

1116
01:03:54,521 --> 01:03:57,455
- He is drunk.
- I had three little margaritas.

1117
01:03:57,457 --> 01:03:59,057
You're about
half your usual size.

1118
01:03:59,059 --> 01:04:00,659
Whatever, whatever.

1119
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:03,429
Alex, what do we do?
How do we get past these guards?

1120
01:04:03,431 --> 01:04:05,065
Last time,
I waited till they left.

1121
01:04:05,067 --> 01:04:06,398
How long did that take?

1122
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,935
- Three weeks?
- Oh, we gonna die.

1123
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:10,703
Okay. Plan B.

1124
01:04:10,705 --> 01:04:12,606
Maybe there's
another door somewhere.

1125
01:04:12,608 --> 01:04:15,443
But we gotta distract
those guys first.

1126
01:04:15,445 --> 01:04:16,811
I've got it.

1127
01:04:16,813 --> 01:04:19,379
Distracting guys is, like,
the main thing I do.

1128
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:20,948
He plays video games,
I distract guys.

1129
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:23,718
Bethany, I hate to break it
to you right now,

1130
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,921
but you don't exactly
have the, um, the tool kit.

1131
01:04:26,923 --> 01:04:31,426
- Not me.
- What?

1132
01:04:31,428 --> 01:04:33,720
You have to go down there
and flirt with those guys...

1133
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:34,096
No.

1134
01:04:34,098 --> 01:04:36,168
...and hold their
attention while we sneak in.

1135
01:04:36,198 --> 01:04:36,566
No!

1136
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:38,401
I can't just go over there
and flirt

1137
01:04:38,403 --> 01:04:39,968
with some weird soldiers
I don't know.

1138
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:42,604
I know, but right now
we don't have a better idea.

1139
01:04:42,606 --> 01:04:45,844
You don't understand.
I actually can't do it.

1140
01:04:47,112 --> 01:04:48,945
I can't talk to guys.

1141
01:04:48,947 --> 01:04:50,781
I'm terrible at it.

1142
01:04:50,783 --> 01:04:53,449
I can give you some pointers.

1143
01:04:53,451 --> 01:04:57,020
No, I'm sorry. We
have to come up with another plan.

1144
01:04:57,022 --> 01:05:00,857
I'm not... No. Heh.
Not doing that.

1145
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:03,494
Martha, you just have to
distract them long enough

1146
01:05:03,496 --> 01:05:04,762
for us
to get into the shed.

1147
01:05:04,764 --> 01:05:06,664
I really don't think
I can, I'm not...

1148
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:10,735
Like, I'm not actually
some badass girl.

1149
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:14,475
What are you talking about?
You're a total badass.

1150
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:19,381
You could do anything.

1151
01:05:25,153 --> 01:05:26,887
That's beautiful, Spencer.

1152
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:29,722
Why don't I set you up
with a nice candlelight dinner?

1153
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:32,726
Or do you guys wanna get
the hell out of here?

1154
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,126
All right.

1155
01:05:34,128 --> 01:05:36,128
Show me how it's done.

1156
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:38,164
Class is in session.

1157
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:39,633
- Come on, girl.
- Okay.

1158
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,602
Watch and learn.

1159
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,104
Hey, what did you mean by
that candlelight-dinner thing?

1160
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,908
- What are you talking about?
- You said it, me and Martha,

1161
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,210
candlelight dinner.
What does that even mean?

1162
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:51,579
The girl is into you,
Spencer.

1163
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,880
What?

1164
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,991
Okay, in flirting
situations,

1165
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,727
the key is making them
check you out

1166
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:07,062
without letting them know

1167
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:08,997
that you know that
they're checking you out.

1168
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:11,534
You're like, "Whatever."
When they try to talk to you,

1169
01:06:11,536 --> 01:06:13,068
you can play it
one of three ways:

1170
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,639
dumb, super into it,
or nasty.

1171
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:18,107
Which way you play it depends on
what guy you deal with.

1172
01:06:18,109 --> 01:06:20,944
This is like my dream and my
nightmare all at one time.

1173
01:06:20,946 --> 01:06:22,913
I'm not gonna
take that personally.

1174
01:06:22,915 --> 01:06:24,748
Now, hair is everything.

1175
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,818
Touch it. Move it.
Play with it.

1176
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:30,889
Move it around a lot.
Hypnotize them with it.

1177
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:34,626
Give me a flip like that.
Okay, now angle your eyes down.

1178
01:06:34,628 --> 01:06:35,927
Now, head down.

1179
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:37,633
Tilt up. Eyes big.

1180
01:06:38,265 --> 01:06:39,866
- Now sparkle.
- Sparkle?

1181
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:42,134
Like an anime character.
Now sparkle.

1182
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:49,975
Needs work.

1183
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,818
Do you really think
she likes me?

1184
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,654
Why are we still
talking about this?

1185
01:07:00,656 --> 01:07:02,589
I mean, what if
she tries to kiss me?

1186
01:07:02,591 --> 01:07:04,057
Then you just
kiss her back, man.

1187
01:07:04,059 --> 01:07:06,694
What if she tries
to kiss me, like...

1188
01:07:06,696 --> 01:07:08,830
Like, without warning?

1189
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:11,899
What are you talking about?
Haven't you ever kissed anyone?

1190
01:07:11,901 --> 01:07:13,868
Don't... You gonna tell
the whole jungle?

1191
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,804
Guys, I found
a side door. Over here.

1192
01:07:15,806 --> 01:07:17,940
- Guess what I found.
- No, no, don't tell him.

1193
01:07:17,942 --> 01:07:19,708
Okay, let's talk about
your walk.

1194
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,076
Take your time.

1195
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:24,247
Make a meal of it.
Like a gorgeous gazelle.

1196
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:27,584
Or a horse. High-step it.
One foot in front of the other.

1197
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:29,553
And bring it.
Boom, boom...

1198
01:07:29,555 --> 01:07:30,886
That's not it.

1199
01:07:30,888 --> 01:07:32,187
Yikes.

1200
01:07:32,189 --> 01:07:34,758
Anything you can do to
draw attention to the lips.

1201
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,026
A little nibble like this.

1202
01:07:36,028 --> 01:07:39,062
A nibble goes
a long way, girlfriend.

1203
01:07:39,064 --> 01:07:41,299
Good. That's better.

1204
01:07:41,301 --> 01:07:43,166
Now smile.
You look terrified.

1205
01:07:43,168 --> 01:07:44,701
Oh, God,
you're so funny.

1206
01:07:44,703 --> 01:07:46,771
- You're so funny.
- Oh, God, you're so funny.

1207
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:48,773
Oh, my God,
you're so funny.

1208
01:07:48,775 --> 01:07:51,343
- I think I'm getting it.
- You are getting it. Go, girl.

1209
01:07:51,345 --> 01:07:53,644
Now, keep your lips
slightly parted, like...

1210
01:07:53,646 --> 01:07:55,680
Yeah, not-not gross,
just relaxed.

1211
01:07:55,682 --> 01:07:57,582
Touch your tongue
to the roof of your mouth.

1212
01:07:57,584 --> 01:07:59,585
- Like this.
- Like this?

1213
01:07:59,587 --> 01:08:01,253
- Like this.
- Like this?

1214
01:08:01,255 --> 01:08:03,889
Like this.

1215
01:08:03,891 --> 01:08:05,857
Like this.

1216
01:08:05,859 --> 01:08:07,694
Like this?

1217
01:08:07,696 --> 01:08:09,061
I think you're ready.

1218
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,197
- Cool.
- Okay, flirt

1219
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:14,067
like our lives depend on it.

1220
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:15,201
'Cause they do.

1221
01:08:15,203 --> 01:08:16,803
Okay, there's the door.

1222
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:18,939
We just need something
to cut through the fence.

1223
01:08:18,941 --> 01:08:21,809
Okay, Fridge, you got anything
like that in the backpack?

1224
01:08:21,811 --> 01:08:24,678
Uh, yeah, I should. What...?

1225
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,882
Here you go. I got some...
Some bolt cutters.

1226
01:08:27,884 --> 01:08:30,352
Does that seem like a good tool
for the situation?

1227
01:08:30,354 --> 01:08:32,654
Perfect, actually.

1228
01:08:32,656 --> 01:08:34,322
It's called backpack power,
baby.

1229
01:08:35,959 --> 01:08:37,692
You guys,

1230
01:08:37,694 --> 01:08:39,327
I think this is gonna work.

1231
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:41,229
I think so too.
She's pretty fly.

1232
01:08:41,231 --> 01:08:43,933
And those guys don't meet
a lot of new people.

1233
01:08:43,935 --> 01:08:45,034
"Fly"?

1234
01:08:45,036 --> 01:08:46,835
Well, not like
Cindy Crawford fly,

1235
01:08:46,837 --> 01:08:49,104
but for Jumanji,
she the bomb.

1236
01:08:49,106 --> 01:08:50,640
"The bomb"?

1237
01:08:50,642 --> 01:08:52,376
- Cindy Crawford?
- That's your go-to?

1238
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,876
I'm just saying, I'm sure

1239
01:08:53,878 --> 01:08:55,948
they'd like to
get jiggy with her.

1240
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:01,886
Alex.

1241
01:09:02,856 --> 01:09:04,858
What year do you think it is?

1242
01:09:05,858 --> 01:09:08,126
- What do you mean?
- Oh, no.

1243
01:09:08,128 --> 01:09:10,630
It's 1996.

1244
01:09:13,334 --> 01:09:15,833
You're Alex Vreeke,
aren't you?

1245
01:09:15,835 --> 01:09:17,135
Yeah, that's right.

1246
01:09:17,137 --> 01:09:19,038
Wait a minute,
you mean Freak House?

1247
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,806
Wait, what are you...
What are you guys talking about?

1248
01:09:21,808 --> 01:09:22,910
How do you know me?

1249
01:09:24,111 --> 01:09:27,046
Alex, I don't know how
to tell you this...

1250
01:09:27,048 --> 01:09:28,982
You've been in this game
for 20 years.

1251
01:09:28,984 --> 01:09:31,985
That's probably not
how I would've done it.

1252
01:09:31,987 --> 01:09:33,353
What?

1253
01:09:33,355 --> 01:09:35,423
No. You guys are messing
with me, right?

1254
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:37,424
No, we're not.
Alex Vreeke.

1255
01:09:37,426 --> 01:09:39,826
Everybody in Brantford
knows about you.

1256
01:09:39,828 --> 01:09:42,729
You're the kid
that disappeared.

1257
01:09:42,731 --> 01:09:44,299
Twenty years ago.

1258
01:09:44,301 --> 01:09:46,268
Twenty years?

1259
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:49,036
Twenty years, man.

1260
01:09:49,038 --> 01:09:51,773
I don't even know
how to say this, but

1261
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,975
Cindy Crawford, dude,
she's like 50 years old.

1262
01:09:53,977 --> 01:09:57,279
- But still fly.
- Eh.

1263
01:09:57,281 --> 01:09:59,783
Wait...

1264
01:10:04,723 --> 01:10:05,958
There she is.

1265
01:10:13,964 --> 01:10:15,133
Hey.

1266
01:10:16,868 --> 01:10:19,203
We're gonna get you home.

1267
01:10:19,205 --> 01:10:21,871
Yeah.

1268
01:10:41,963 --> 01:10:44,063
The hell is
going on with her butt?

1269
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:45,997
Bethany, what did
you tell her to do?

1270
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:48,067
Did she twist her ankle,
maybe, or...?

1271
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:50,306
She's never flirted before.
Give her a break.

1272
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:57,211
Hello, little lady.

1273
01:10:57,213 --> 01:10:59,249
What are you doing
out here all alone?

1274
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,284
Hey, you guys.

1275
01:11:03,286 --> 01:11:05,852
I seem to be lost.

1276
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:08,388
Can you guys help me?

1277
01:11:10,559 --> 01:11:13,160
Hello, little lady.

1278
01:11:13,162 --> 01:11:15,265
What are you doing
out here all alone?

1279
01:11:19,135 --> 01:11:21,237
You guys are so
interesting and funny.

1280
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:22,538
What's she doing?

1281
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,573
What, she got a bug
in her hair?

1282
01:11:24,575 --> 01:11:27,142
She's forgotten
all of our training.

1283
01:11:27,144 --> 01:11:28,748
Let's go.

1284
01:11:32,818 --> 01:11:36,018
Wait! I... I... I
have to tell you

1285
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,322
about this book
that I've been reading.

1286
01:11:38,324 --> 01:11:40,256
About microbiology.

1287
01:11:40,258 --> 01:11:44,264
Which is one of
my favorite biologies.

1288
01:11:50,571 --> 01:11:52,236
Hello, little lady.

1289
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:55,507
What are you doing
out here all alone?

1290
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,885

What's the move?

01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:01,043
- What?

Go, go!

1335
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:20,663
Yes! Yes! You're my hero.

1336
01:14:22,133 --> 01:14:24,067
- We gotta go.
- You should give me

1337
01:14:24,069 --> 01:14:25,403
lessons in kicking ass.

1338
01:14:25,405 --> 01:14:26,436
Give me a hug.

1339
01:14:26,438 --> 01:14:27,605
- Oh, my God.
- You did it.

1340
01:14:27,607 --> 01:14:29,440
- I did.
- Yeah, give me a hug, girlfriend.

1341
01:14:29,442 --> 01:14:32,244
As great of a moment as that is,
we ain't got the time.

1342
01:14:32,246 --> 01:14:33,711
- Yeah.
- They coming.

1343
01:14:33,713 --> 01:14:35,347
The motorcycle freaks
is coming.

1344
01:14:35,349 --> 01:14:37,516
Seaplane!
We got to fly, man.

1345
01:14:37,518 --> 01:14:40,118
Nope. I can't do it.

1346
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,488
Okay? I told you,
I'm not a good pilot.

1347
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,156
Maybe we should take
the school bus.

1348
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:47,526
We can't outrun no motorcycle
on no damn bus!

1349
01:14:47,528 --> 01:14:49,562
You picked the plane
and hot-air balloon.

1350
01:14:49,564 --> 01:14:50,797
Maybe pick
the helicopter.

1351
01:14:50,799 --> 01:14:53,500
No, I can't do it. Okay?
I don't wanna die.

1352
01:14:53,502 --> 01:14:56,635
I'm freaking out
a little bit.

1353
01:14:56,637 --> 01:14:59,772
Fine. I'll do it.

1354
01:14:59,774 --> 01:15:01,776
How hard can it be?
It's a helicopter.

1355
01:15:01,778 --> 01:15:03,676
You... You press
a button, the...

1356
01:15:03,678 --> 01:15:05,345
They gonna spin. Okay.

1357
01:15:05,347 --> 01:15:07,782
Then after that, I got my...
The... The lever.

1358
01:15:07,784 --> 01:15:09,582
That's how...
That's how you getting

1359
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:11,051
the forward-backward action.

1360
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:13,688
Once we in the air,
I'mma be all right.

1361
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:15,556
This, I just gotta get...

1362
01:15:15,558 --> 01:15:17,525
'Cause it ain't got
no step stool, so...

1363
01:15:17,527 --> 01:15:19,795
Let me see something.
I can probably just...

1364
01:15:19,797 --> 01:15:21,297
Get in, but be careful.

1365
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:23,298
- No, you're drunk.
- No way. Nuh-uh.

1366
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,568
Fridge, you're drunk.
Give me the keys.

1367
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:28,170
- I'm?
- Alex. Alex.

1368
01:15:28,172 --> 01:15:29,504
If I can fight
those guys,

1369
01:15:29,506 --> 01:15:32,308
you can fly this helicopter.
I know you can.

1370
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:33,676
Come on.

1371
01:15:35,813 --> 01:15:38,347
Alex.

1372
01:15:38,349 --> 01:15:40,717
This is where we need you.

1373
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,157
Remember,
you're the missing piece.

1374
01:15:46,591 --> 01:15:50,527
Seaplane McDonough
reporting for duty.

1375
01:15:50,529 --> 01:15:51,728
Let's go, people.

1376
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,153
Whoa!

1377
01:16:14,155 --> 01:16:16,191
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1378
01:16:23,299 --> 01:16:25,700
- What's wrong?
- Something's broken!

1379
01:16:25,702 --> 01:16:26,767
- What?
- What do you mean?

1380
01:16:26,769 --> 01:16:29,736
Hang on!

1381
01:16:35,278 --> 01:16:37,345
Oh, my God,
we're about to die!

1382
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:38,649
We're about to die!

1383
01:16:46,556 --> 01:16:48,924
- Oh, my God!
- It won't go up!

1384
01:16:48,926 --> 01:16:50,792
- What?
- What do you mean?

1385
01:16:50,794 --> 01:16:52,193
The collective is busted.

1386
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:53,662
- What?
- It controls the plate up there,

1387
01:16:53,664 --> 01:16:56,198
which tilts the rotors
and controls the pitch.

1388
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,304
It's how we go up and down.

1389
01:17:05,511 --> 01:17:07,377
You guys?

1390
01:17:07,379 --> 01:17:10,116
- That can't be good.
- It's no way that's good news.

1391
01:17:17,723 --> 01:17:19,259
Albino rhinos!

1392
01:17:23,297 --> 01:17:24,729
They're indigenous
to Jumanji.

1393
01:17:24,731 --> 01:17:26,831
They're huge,
white, scary, and stupid,

1394
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,604
- and they eat people.
- No.

1395
01:17:31,406 --> 01:17:32,772
They're getting close!

1396
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:35,274
My stomach's starting
to bother me a bit.

1397
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:37,510
- Go up!
- I can't go up!

1398
01:17:37,512 --> 01:17:39,379
I think I had
too many margaritas.

1399
01:17:43,718 --> 01:17:46,220
You guys,
what are we gonna do?

1400
01:17:46,222 --> 01:17:47,555
I'll fix the helicopter.

1401
01:17:47,557 --> 01:17:48,988
- Yes!
- Tell me what to do.

1402
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:51,259
You gotta connect
the flight-control rod

1403
01:17:51,261 --> 01:17:52,693
to the mesh plate
under the rotors.

1404
01:17:52,695 --> 01:17:55,430
Flight-control rod, mesh plate,
under the rotors.

1405
01:17:55,432 --> 01:17:57,399
- Wait, what?
- I'll be right back.

1406
01:17:57,401 --> 01:18:01,403
- Spencer, where are you going?
- Hurry up.

1407
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:02,937
- Be careful!
- No, no, just hurry up!

1408
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:05,608
All right, just
gonna stand on this thingy,

1409
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:09,548
pull myself up towards these
deadly helicopter blades. Okay.

1410
01:18:11,781 --> 01:18:13,849
There's the mesh plate.

1411
01:18:13,851 --> 01:18:15,584
Here's that rod thingy.

1412
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:27,800
- Spencer!
- Speed it up, Alex!

1413
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:39,280
Spencer!

1414
01:18:41,949 --> 01:18:45,221
Hurry! Come on, fix it!

1415
01:18:50,724 --> 01:18:53,292
- Oh, my God!
- Running out of time!

1416
01:18:53,294 --> 01:18:55,231
- Fix it, please!
- No, no, no.

1417
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:57,700
Got it!

1418
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:08,042
We made it! You did it!
I thought we were gonna die.

1419
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:09,343
- Oh.
- Yes!

1420
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:10,878
- Nice!
- Thank you.

1421
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,714
- Thank you, guys.
- You did it. That was scary.

1422
01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:15,048
Oops.

1423
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,653
What?

1424
01:19:17,854 --> 01:19:19,486
I dropped the jewel.

1425
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:20,922
What?

1426
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:21,990
You dropped the jewel?

1427
01:19:21,992 --> 01:19:23,459
I leaned over,

1428
01:19:23,461 --> 01:19:25,093
thought I had to puke,
and I didn't.

1429
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:26,528
It came out
of my backpack.

1430
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:28,664
- We need the freaking jewel!
- I know.

1431
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:31,666
That's-that's-that's the crazy
part 'cause I know we need it.

1432
01:19:31,668 --> 01:19:33,635
So we're in a pickle.
We're in a pickle.

1433
01:19:33,637 --> 01:19:35,404
Turn around.
We gotta go get it.

1434
01:19:35,406 --> 01:19:37,407
Yeah, let's loop around.
Look for it.

1435
01:19:37,409 --> 01:19:38,574
Everybody open your eyes.

1436
01:19:38,576 --> 01:19:40,480
Let's all look for it
as a group.

1437
01:19:47,953 --> 01:19:49,389
There! I see it!

1438
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:58,663
What are they doing?

1439
01:19:58,665 --> 01:20:00,898
It's like they're
protecting it or something.

1440
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,402
- How are we gonna do this?
- I don't know.

1441
01:20:04,404 --> 01:20:06,437
Well, you gotta go get it,
right, buddy?

1442
01:20:10,044 --> 01:20:11,976
What do you need?
Your boomerang?

1443
01:20:11,978 --> 01:20:13,746
Maybe some scissors?

1444
01:20:13,748 --> 01:20:15,981
A pipe wrench?
Some shoelaces?

1445
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:18,985
I'm your valet. Whatever
you need, I can get it for you.

1446
01:20:18,987 --> 01:20:21,653
Okay? You just say the word.

1447
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:23,456
- What?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

1448
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:24,458
Sorry for what?

1449
01:20:26,127 --> 01:20:27,761
Ow!

1450
01:20:34,904 --> 01:20:36,407
No.

1451
01:20:49,186 --> 01:20:50,820
Turn us around.

1452
01:20:50,822 --> 01:20:52,358
No!

1453
01:20:54,858 --> 01:20:57,760
Heel! Heel! Stop!

1454
01:20:57,762 --> 01:20:59,628
Oh, my God!

1455
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:02,030
- No!
- Alex, get ready to roll us

1456
01:21:02,032 --> 01:21:03,499
- to the side.
- What?

1457
01:21:05,037 --> 01:21:07,841
SPENCER; When I tell you,
roll 90 degrees to the right.

1458
01:21:09,175 --> 01:21:10,175
Now!

1459
01:21:14,581 --> 01:21:17,549
You pushed me out
the helicopter, jackass!

1460
01:21:20,186 --> 01:21:22,053
Oh, wow!

1461
01:21:22,055 --> 01:21:24,789
- Spencer, you're amazing.
- Thank you.

1462
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:26,692
You are a killer pilot, Alex.

1463
01:21:26,694 --> 01:21:28,661
- Thanks.
- You too, Spencer,

1464
01:21:28,663 --> 01:21:30,662
- you were incredible!
- Thank you...

1465
01:21:30,664 --> 01:21:32,797
- Hey!
- ...but he was amazing, our pilot.

1466
01:21:32,799 --> 01:21:34,533
- Excuse me.
- You killed it.

1467
01:21:34,535 --> 01:21:35,701
Excuse me.

1468
01:21:35,703 --> 01:21:36,868
Excuse me!

1469
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,938
I'm the one that
was a human sacrifice.

1470
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:42,676
You don't know what's on
the underside of those rhinos.

1471
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:44,610
And you don't wanna know.

1472
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:46,946
I've seen a lot of things.

1473
01:21:46,948 --> 01:21:48,914
Felt them on my face too.

1474
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:51,852
Things that I will never be able
to erase from memory.

1475
01:21:53,223 --> 01:21:54,688
Oh, that's funny to you guys.

1476
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:57,027
Go ahead, laugh it up.
Get it out.

1477
01:21:59,662 --> 01:22:01,629
Guys, I've been trying
to get across

1478
01:22:01,631 --> 01:22:03,564
this canyon for, like,
20 years, okay?

1479
01:22:03,566 --> 01:22:05,165
Do you realize
how huge this is?

1480
01:22:09,974 --> 01:22:11,205
Mosquito.

1481
01:22:11,207 --> 01:22:13,875
No, no, no!
Alex, no, no, no!

1482
01:22:13,877 --> 01:22:16,077
- Alex.
- Alex, no, no.

1483
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:17,514
Alex?

1484
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,782
Alex, talk to me.
Wake up. Here we go.

1485
01:22:19,784 --> 01:22:21,584
Alex? He's dying.

1486
01:22:21,586 --> 01:22:23,587
No, we can't let him die.
We're too close!

1487
01:22:23,589 --> 01:22:25,087
Does anyone
know how to do CPR?

1488
01:22:25,089 --> 01:22:28,225
Yeah, start with three chest
compressions and mouth-to-mouth.

1489
01:22:28,227 --> 01:22:30,159
One, two, three.

1490
01:22:30,161 --> 01:22:31,862
How do I do this?

1491
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,697
Okay, pinch his nose,
open his mouth,

1492
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:34,965
- full lip-lock.
- Okay.

1493
01:22:34,967 --> 01:22:38,606
Ah, one breath, two breaths,
then repeat.

1494
01:22:46,612 --> 01:22:48,616
Come on, Alex.

1495
01:22:51,151 --> 01:22:53,755
Bethany, stop. Your tattoo.

1496
01:22:55,023 --> 01:22:57,826
It looks like you're giving him
one of your lives.

1497
01:22:59,595 --> 01:23:00,927
I'm okay with that.

1498
01:23:00,929 --> 01:23:02,696
What if you need it
for yourself?

1499
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:04,901
I want Alex to come home too.

1500
01:23:19,149 --> 01:23:21,181
Oh!

1501
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,824
- What happened?
- Alex,

1502
01:23:29,826 --> 01:23:32,262
Bethany gave you
one of her lives.

1503
01:23:32,264 --> 01:23:33,628
Bethany, you okay?

1504
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:34,829
I think so.

1505
01:23:34,831 --> 01:23:36,298
Bethany,
is that true?

1506
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,634
You gave me
one of your lives?

1507
01:23:38,636 --> 01:23:40,637
I mean, yeah, of course.

1508
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,942
Thank you.

1509
01:23:51,983 --> 01:23:53,651
What? What are
you looking at?

1510
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:54,954
You got a situation.

1511
01:23:58,123 --> 01:24:01,025
Oh, my God,
these things are crazy.

1512
01:24:15,809 --> 01:24:17,879
Twenty years,
huh?

1513
01:24:18,847 --> 01:24:20,950
Yeah,
I guess so.

1514
01:24:24,919 --> 01:24:26,118
You know,

1515
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,056
I just keep thinking about
my poor parents.

1516
01:24:29,058 --> 01:24:31,025
And what they must've
been through.

1517
01:24:31,027 --> 01:24:34,028
And why, because I was sitting
in my hideout,

1518
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:35,865
too afraid
to finish the game?

1519
01:24:39,735 --> 01:24:41,236
I'm sorry.

1520
01:24:41,238 --> 01:24:44,406
I don't mean to lay this on you.
I'm just...

1521
01:24:44,408 --> 01:24:46,341
You're really easy
to talk to.

1522
01:24:46,343 --> 01:24:49,177
No, I get it.
I mean, sometimes

1523
01:24:49,179 --> 01:24:52,179
it's easy to get so focused
on your own stuff

1524
01:24:52,181 --> 01:24:55,854
that you forget other people
have problems too.

1525
01:24:56,887 --> 01:24:58,287
That's really deep.

1526
01:24:58,289 --> 01:25:01,757
Thanks. I feel like
ever since I lost my phone,

1527
01:25:01,759 --> 01:25:03,862
my other senses have
kind of heightened.

1528
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:08,767
Does "phone" mean something
different in the future?

1529
01:25:13,038 --> 01:25:15,072
What about you, Alex?
What are you like?

1530
01:25:15,074 --> 01:25:18,012
In the real world.
What's your vibe?

1531
01:25:19,246 --> 01:25:20,811
Full-on
metalhead.

1532
01:25:20,813 --> 01:25:23,784
A drummer, like my dad.

1533
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:39,934
Hey.

1534
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,469
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

1535
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,905
I, uh, I was just
filling these up.

1536
01:25:45,907 --> 01:25:48,110
- Cool.
- Yeah.

1537
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,016
I'm glad you're here.
I, uh, ahem...

1538
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:58,520
- I have something to tell you.
- Yeah?

1539
01:25:58,522 --> 01:26:00,153
And I wanna tell you now,

1540
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,489
just in case
the next time

1541
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:05,862
that we talk
I'm no longer brave.

1542
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:09,800
I like you, Martha.

1543
01:26:10,867 --> 01:26:13,436
I, like, like you.

1544
01:26:14,839 --> 01:26:17,539
Like,
I'm fully into you.

1545
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:20,375
- You are?
- I am.

1546
01:26:20,377 --> 01:26:22,145
And I have been

1547
01:26:22,147 --> 01:26:24,716
since, like,
the seventh grade.

1548
01:26:26,017 --> 01:26:27,017
Really?

1549
01:26:28,386 --> 01:26:31,355
Wowza. I don't think
this has ever happened before.

1550
01:26:31,357 --> 01:26:34,124
- What do you mean?
- Oh, I mean, like, I don't think

1551
01:26:34,126 --> 01:26:38,061
anyone's ever liked me that I...
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1552
01:26:38,063 --> 01:26:40,166
I never tell anyone
how I fe...

1553
01:26:43,102 --> 01:26:45,739
I'm into you too,
Spencer.

1554
01:26:46,839 --> 01:26:49,072
- You are?
- Yes. Yes! Heh, heh!

1555
01:26:49,074 --> 01:26:53,011
God, you're smart
and sweet and cute.

1556
01:26:53,013 --> 01:26:55,146
Yeah, I'm pretty into you.

1557
01:26:57,286 --> 01:27:02,921
Wait. Are you sure it's not
because of, like, all of...?

1558
01:27:02,923 --> 01:27:04,990
What? Oh, my God, no, no.

1559
01:27:04,992 --> 01:27:07,561
That is not my type.
I'm into nerds.

1560
01:27:07,563 --> 01:27:09,930
Really?

1561
01:27:09,932 --> 01:27:11,398
I'm a nerd.

1562
01:27:31,222 --> 01:27:33,955
- That was... I was so awful.
- I've never kissed anyone.

1563
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:36,191
- You've never...?
- Never. That was the first time.

1564
01:27:36,193 --> 01:27:37,626
- I have never.
- Oh, you haven't?

1565
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:38,994
- No.
- Okay. Cool.

1566
01:27:38,996 --> 01:27:41,366
You can't tell, right?

1567
01:27:44,336 --> 01:27:46,202
Come on. Hey!

1568
01:27:46,204 --> 01:27:49,037
I don't wanna see that.
I don't, not today.

1569
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:51,107
While you're down here
professing your love

1570
01:27:51,109 --> 01:27:53,944
for one another,
I found the Jaguar.

1571
01:27:53,946 --> 01:27:57,547
Let's go. God! Ugh!

1572
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:10,094
- There it is.
- There it is.

1573
01:28:10,096 --> 01:28:12,200
We'd better get walking.

1574
01:28:34,056 --> 01:28:37,060
I think we just
follow this path.

1575
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,431
No. It can't be that easy.

1576
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:44,368
"The Defenders."

1577
01:28:45,669 --> 01:28:47,239
What does
that mean?

1578
01:28:48,305 --> 01:28:50,241
There's only one way
to find out.

1579
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,342
Fridge,

1580
01:28:54,344 --> 01:28:55,610
give me the jewel.

1581
01:28:59,183 --> 01:29:00,453
Spencer.

1582
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:18,068
Something's about to happen.

1583
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:20,103
I hate those drums.

1584
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:23,206
What, you're just gonna
walk in there?

1585
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:24,576
No.

1586
01:29:24,578 --> 01:29:28,516
That's what the game wants us
to do. Follow the path.

1587
01:29:29,717 --> 01:29:31,920
It's a trap.

1588
01:29:37,325 --> 01:29:39,327
"When you see the elephant...

1589
01:29:40,461 --> 01:29:42,932
begin the climb."

1590
01:29:48,169 --> 01:29:49,636
I'll go through the trees.

1591
01:29:49,638 --> 01:29:51,069
- The trees?
- Yeah.

1592
01:29:51,071 --> 01:29:52,573
Do you think
that's what that means?

1593
01:29:52,575 --> 01:29:53,673
That must be it.

1594
01:29:53,675 --> 01:29:55,476
That's the move.

1595
01:29:55,478 --> 01:29:58,345
This is the final level
of the game.

1596
01:29:58,347 --> 01:30:01,452
And I'm pretty sure
this is a Bravestone thing.

1597
01:30:06,288 --> 01:30:08,723
Did he just refer to himself
in the third person?

1598
01:30:08,725 --> 01:30:12,195
Um, fourth person, I think.

1599
01:30:18,636 --> 01:30:20,669
How does he do that?

1600
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:23,104
Climbing is one
of his strengths.

1601
01:30:23,106 --> 01:30:25,274
Oh. Gotcha.

1602
01:30:25,276 --> 01:30:28,113
Cake makes me
explode.

1603
01:30:48,801 --> 01:30:52,404
- No! Spencer!
- Oh, my God!

1604
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:54,673
Spencer!

1605
01:30:54,675 --> 01:30:57,642
Spencer!

1606
01:31:02,116 --> 01:31:03,683
Oh, my God, you guys.
Panthers.

1607
01:31:03,685 --> 01:31:05,287
No.

1608
01:31:09,524 --> 01:31:12,061
Those are jaguars.

1609
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:34,350
Spencer!

1610
01:31:34,352 --> 01:31:36,184
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1611
01:31:36,186 --> 01:31:38,320
Yeah. I think so.

1612
01:31:38,322 --> 01:31:41,223
You still have the jewel,
right?

1613
01:31:41,225 --> 01:31:42,725
- I got it.
- Oh, thank God.

1614
01:31:42,727 --> 01:31:43,860
Hey, what happened?

1615
01:31:43,862 --> 01:31:46,362
I don't wanna talk
about it.

1616
01:31:46,364 --> 01:31:48,164
Okay, we need a new plan.

1617
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:49,398
- Yeah.
- Right.

1618
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,637
- Totally.
- Spencer, any ideas?

1619
01:31:53,572 --> 01:31:56,243
Can I speak with you
for a minute?

1620
01:31:57,475 --> 01:31:58,644
Now?

1621
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,083
What's going on?

1622
01:32:03,816 --> 01:32:05,349
I can't do this.

1623
01:32:05,351 --> 01:32:08,653
- What are you talking about?
- I can't do this.

1624
01:32:08,655 --> 01:32:11,822
Okay, who am I kidding?
I'm not some adventurer.

1625
01:32:11,824 --> 01:32:14,359
I'm not actually brave.

1626
01:32:14,361 --> 01:32:16,761
Spencer, I just saw you
hanging out of a helicopter.

1627
01:32:16,763 --> 01:32:20,232
It's a lot easier to be brave
when you have lives to spare.

1628
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:21,570
It's a lot harder...

1629
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,904
when you only have one life.

1630
01:32:26,308 --> 01:32:29,808
We-we always only have
one life, man.

1631
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:33,747
Okay? That's... That's all
we get. That's how it works.

1632
01:32:33,749 --> 01:32:37,450
The question is,
is how are you gonna live it?

1633
01:32:37,452 --> 01:32:40,357
Which guy are
you gonna decide to be?

1634
01:32:42,425 --> 01:32:43,924
Did I just quote
our principal?

1635
01:32:43,926 --> 01:32:47,528
What the hell is this game doing
to me? I gotta get out of here.

1636
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:48,795
Look.

1637
01:32:48,797 --> 01:32:51,201
We can do this, man.

1638
01:32:51,968 --> 01:32:53,538
We can do it together.

1639
01:32:57,208 --> 01:33:00,412
- Together.
- Together.

1640
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,416
You're a good friend,
Fridge.

1641
01:33:07,785 --> 01:33:09,388
All right.

1642
01:33:10,423 --> 01:33:12,690
Okay. I don't know
video games,

1643
01:33:12,692 --> 01:33:14,957
but what I do know
is football.

1644
01:33:14,959 --> 01:33:17,895
Now, those lightning-fast,
man-eating cats out there?

1645
01:33:17,897 --> 01:33:19,430
They're the Defenders.

1646
01:33:19,432 --> 01:33:21,832
Which means we gotta run
one hell of an offense.

1647
01:33:21,834 --> 01:33:22,967
You guys.

1648
01:33:25,804 --> 01:33:27,304
We gotta go.

1649
01:33:27,306 --> 01:33:29,343
All right.
Here's what we're gonna do.

1650
01:33:31,877 --> 01:33:34,513
<i>We're gonna fan out
and run a play that I call:</i>

1651
01:33:34,515 --> 01:33:36,780
<i>"The Double Reverse
Refrigerator."</i>

1652
01:33:36,782 --> 01:33:39,785
<i>Bethany,
you go up the left side.</i>

1653
01:33:39,787 --> 01:33:41,454
<i>I'll go up the right.</i>

1654
01:33:41,456 --> 01:33:43,356
<i>Alex, you'll draw
the defense,</i>

1655
01:33:43,358 --> 01:33:44,824
<i>so Spencer can go
up the middle.</i>

1656
01:33:44,826 --> 01:33:46,726
<i>- I'll go with Spencer.
- No.</i>

1657
01:33:46,728 --> 01:33:48,728
<i>There's something else
we need you to do.</i>

1658
01:33:49,997 --> 01:33:53,599
<i>♪ Ooh, baby
I love your way ♪</i>

1659
01:33:53,601 --> 01:33:56,603
<i>♪ Every day, yeah ♪</i>

1660
01:33:56,605 --> 01:34:00,040
<i>♪ Ooh, baby
I love your way ♪</i>

1661
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:01,676
You guys like to dance?

1662
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:08,619
<i>♪ Shadows grow so long
Before my eyes ♪</i>

1663
01:34:18,629 --> 01:34:20,796
Hey! Over here!

1664
01:34:20,798 --> 01:34:22,767
Come and get me!

1665
01:34:36,915 --> 01:34:40,951
<i>♪ I wanna tell you, I wanna
Tell you, I wanna tell you ♪</i>

1666
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:49,563
No! No.

1667
01:35:00,874 --> 01:35:02,411
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1668
01:35:04,912 --> 01:35:06,682
Get to the statue. Go!

1669
01:35:26,902 --> 01:35:28,405
Oh, no! I...

1670
01:36:04,075 --> 01:36:07,647
Ah, whoa, whoa.

1671
01:36:38,513 --> 01:36:40,948
Oh, man. Okay.

1672
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:43,016
Stay calm, don't panic.

1673
01:36:43,018 --> 01:36:44,654
Stop!

1674
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,993
It's the elephant
and the mouse.

1675
01:36:52,763 --> 01:36:54,161
What's up?

1676
01:36:54,163 --> 01:36:56,131
Mouse Finbar.

1677
01:36:56,133 --> 01:36:58,234
Zoologist.

1678
01:36:58,236 --> 01:37:00,836
Zoologist and...

1679
01:37:00,838 --> 01:37:03,006
And backpack guy.

1680
01:37:22,229 --> 01:37:25,633
Give me the jewel,
or your friend dies.

1681
01:37:27,234 --> 01:37:29,533
- Don't give it to him!
- Quiet!

1682
01:37:29,535 --> 01:37:30,969
Stop!

1683
01:37:35,741 --> 01:37:38,713
Take me instead,
okay?

1684
01:37:47,289 --> 01:37:48,857
Give me the jewel.

1685
01:37:49,924 --> 01:37:51,257
I can't do that.

1686
01:37:51,259 --> 01:37:53,091
Five.

1687
01:37:53,093 --> 01:37:56,562
- Four, three...
- I can't give you the jewel.

1688
01:37:56,564 --> 01:37:57,963
- Spencer.
- Two!

1689
01:37:57,965 --> 01:37:59,999
Because I don't have it!

1690
01:38:07,644 --> 01:38:09,546
Zoology, bitch!

1691
01:38:21,025 --> 01:38:22,957
No, no, no! Don't...

1692
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:32,402
Douche bag! You suck!

1693
01:38:36,274 --> 01:38:38,644
- Elephant.
- "Begin the climb."

1694
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,747
Leave her alone!

1695
01:38:43,749 --> 01:38:45,716
Get up there,
I'll get the jewel to you.

1696
01:38:45,718 --> 01:38:46,950
- Martha.
- Trust me.

1697
01:38:46,952 --> 01:38:48,921
- I'll get it to you. Go.
- Okay.

1698
01:38:55,929 --> 01:38:57,765
Go, Martha!

1699
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:06,606
Alex!

1700
01:40:06,739 --> 01:40:08,642
I'll take that.

1701
01:40:21,088 --> 01:40:23,422
Game over.

1702
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:34,937
I don't think so.

1703
01:40:39,809 --> 01:40:41,143
Venom's my weakness.

1704
01:41:11,075 --> 01:41:12,077
Go, Spencer.

1705
01:41:22,086 --> 01:41:23,156
No.

1706
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,095
- Yeah!
- Wow!

1707
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:36,737
Yeah.

1708
01:41:49,917 --> 01:41:51,384
"Call out its name."

1709
01:41:51,386 --> 01:41:52,519
Call out its name!

1710
01:41:52,521 --> 01:41:54,254
Call out its name, everyone!

1711
01:41:54,256 --> 01:41:55,854
Jumanji!

1712
01:41:55,856 --> 01:41:59,326
Jumanji!

1713
01:42:40,171 --> 01:42:42,238
- I think we did it.
- I think we won.

1714
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,140
I think we did.

1715
01:42:44,142 --> 01:42:46,310
Guys,
it's Nigel.

1716
01:42:46,312 --> 01:42:47,945
Nigel.

1717
01:42:56,122 --> 01:42:58,457
Well done,
intrepid adventurers!

1718
01:42:58,459 --> 01:42:59,957
You lifted the curse!

1719
01:42:59,959 --> 01:43:02,261
All of Jumanji thanks you.

1720
01:43:02,263 --> 01:43:03,561
Your work here is done.

1721
01:43:03,563 --> 01:43:06,532
So, sadly,
this is where we part.

1722
01:43:06,534 --> 01:43:08,400
Seaplane McDonough,

1723
01:43:08,402 --> 01:43:10,105
let me shake your hand.

1724
01:43:17,312 --> 01:43:18,814
Alex.

1725
01:43:23,418 --> 01:43:25,854
Adieu, Professor Oberon.

1726
01:43:31,627 --> 01:43:33,230
Later, dude.

1727
01:43:39,235 --> 01:43:41,236
I'll miss you the most,
my little Mouse.

1728
01:43:41,238 --> 01:43:43,341
Get me the hell
out of here.

1729
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,116
Farewell, Ruby Roundhouse.

1730
01:43:54,386 --> 01:43:55,984
Wait.

1731
01:43:55,986 --> 01:43:57,956
What if we didn't go back?

1732
01:43:59,457 --> 01:44:01,059
I just...

1733
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:05,966
I like being like this.
With you.

1734
01:44:06,965 --> 01:44:10,235
Then let's be like this,

1735
01:44:10,237 --> 01:44:12,104
every day.

1736
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:15,909
Just come home.

1737
01:44:32,961 --> 01:44:34,429
Dr. Bravestone.

1738
01:44:46,709 --> 01:44:50,179
Nigel, I'm ready to go home.

1739
01:44:51,112 --> 01:44:53,049
Farewell, my good man.

1740
01:44:57,987 --> 01:45:00,124
See you later,
Bravestone.

1741
01:45:30,188 --> 01:45:31,389
Oh, my God.

1742
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:34,692
Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes!
I'm back, baby!

1743
01:45:34,694 --> 01:45:37,429
I will never complain
about my body ever again.

1744
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:38,729
Oh, thank God.

1745
01:45:38,731 --> 01:45:40,233
Oh, I missed you.

1746
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,442
Where's Alex?

1747
01:46:09,799 --> 01:46:12,101
Wait, look.

1748
01:46:15,538 --> 01:46:17,107
Freak House?

1749
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:22,478
Do you think...?

1750
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:25,082
That means, maybe...

1751
01:46:35,227 --> 01:46:37,229
- Grandpa!
- Hey!

1752
01:46:38,629 --> 01:46:42,332
Come here. Come here.
Oh, that's my girl.

1753
01:46:42,334 --> 01:46:45,635
- Hi!
- So good to see you.

1754
01:46:45,637 --> 01:46:48,306
Come on. Come on
and say hi to Grandma.

1755
01:46:48,308 --> 01:46:50,408
- Alex?
- Hey, Dad, when you get a sec,

1756
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:52,843
- could you give us a hand?
- Yeah.

1757
01:46:52,845 --> 01:46:55,378
Oh, that is some tree.

1758
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:58,352
- Yeah, it's not too bad.
- Yeah.

1759
01:47:02,823 --> 01:47:04,589
Hey, Dad, will you
give me a second?

1760
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:07,194
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- I'll be right back.

1761
01:47:21,376 --> 01:47:22,478
Bethany?

1762
01:47:24,913 --> 01:47:28,084
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

1763
01:47:28,784 --> 01:47:29,850
Ruby Roundhouse?

1764
01:47:33,589 --> 01:47:35,393
And that
would make you Fridge.

1765
01:47:39,897 --> 01:47:41,930
I'm stoked to see you.

1766
01:47:41,932 --> 01:47:43,468
All of you.

1767
01:47:44,701 --> 01:47:47,236
- You made it back.
- Yeah, I did.

1768
01:47:47,238 --> 01:47:50,242
It spit me out
right where I started, so...

1769
01:47:51,542 --> 01:47:52,874
1996.

1770
01:47:52,876 --> 01:47:55,844
And your parents
and your house?

1771
01:47:55,846 --> 01:47:58,684
Yeah, they... All good, bro.

1772
01:48:02,253 --> 01:48:04,521
You're an adult now.

1773
01:48:04,523 --> 01:48:05,956
You have a family.

1774
01:48:05,958 --> 01:48:07,890
I do, yeah.

1775
01:48:07,892 --> 01:48:09,893
This is Andy.

1776
01:48:09,895 --> 01:48:11,496
And then my daughter...

1777
01:48:11,498 --> 01:48:14,735
My daughter's name
is Bethany.

1778
01:48:17,270 --> 01:48:19,703
We named her after the girl
who saved my life.

1779
01:48:26,647 --> 01:48:28,750
So stoked. Heh.

1780
01:48:48,704 --> 01:48:49,969
Yo.

1781
01:48:49,971 --> 01:48:51,440
Yo.

1782
01:48:52,441 --> 01:48:56,009
You wanna
go backpacking?

1783
01:48:56,011 --> 01:48:58,412
Like, in nature?

1784
01:48:58,414 --> 01:49:01,282
Yeah, but, like, somewhere,
like, really amazing.

1785
01:49:01,284 --> 01:49:03,885
Next summer?
What do you think?

1786
01:49:03,887 --> 01:49:06,424
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

1787
01:49:07,591 --> 01:49:09,523
Oh, um,
I'll catch you later.

1788
01:49:09,525 --> 01:49:11,329
I'll see you after class?

1789
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:14,430
- Hey!
- Hello.

1790
01:49:14,432 --> 01:49:16,532
- Hey.
- So, uh, anything...

1791
01:49:16,534 --> 01:49:18,267
interesting
happen lately?

1792
01:49:18,269 --> 01:49:20,303
No, I can't think
of anything.

1793
01:49:20,305 --> 01:49:21,637
Yeah. Heh.

1794
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:23,339
Have you guys talked
to Martha?

1795
01:49:23,341 --> 01:49:25,841
Oh, I was texting her
this weekend.

1796
01:49:25,843 --> 01:49:28,314
Have you talked to her?

1797
01:49:29,314 --> 01:49:31,317
Hey. There she is.

1798
01:49:36,355 --> 01:49:39,492
Go get that girl,
Dr. Bravestone.

1799
01:49:47,067 --> 01:49:48,434
Hi.

1800
01:49:48,436 --> 01:49:50,603
- Hi.
- I really...

1801
01:49:50,605 --> 01:49:52,505
- I really wanted to call you.
- I get it.

1802
01:49:52,507 --> 01:49:54,439
Sorry, I don't know
why I didn't call.

1803
01:49:54,441 --> 01:49:55,774
It's weird being out and,

1804
01:49:55,776 --> 01:49:58,777
not, like, knowing,
like, what's going on and...

1805
01:50:02,584 --> 01:50:03,917
What?

1806
01:50:17,366 --> 01:50:18,835
Smoldering.

1807
