1
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,544
We're here! Time to muscle up.

2
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,171
Hello?

3
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,466
Who's there?

4
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,299
You scared me to death, you mangy thing.

5
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,637
I'm just looking for
an old well. Know it?

6
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,933
Not talking, huh?

7
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,396
Magic dowser, magic dowser...

8
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,358
Show me the well!

9
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,454
Get away from me!

10
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,340
Ooh.

11
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,508
Let me guess. You're from Texas or Utah,

12
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,761
someplace dried-out and barren, right?

13
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,930
I heard about water witching
before, but it doesn't make sense.

14
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,807
I mean, it's just an ordinary branch.

15
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,768
It's a dowsing rod.

16
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,977
Ow!

17
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,271
And I don't like being stalked,

18
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,690
not by psycho nerds or their cats!

19
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,026
He's not really my
cat. He's kind of feral.

20
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,527
You know, wild.

21
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,738
Of course, I do feed him every night,

22
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,573
and sometimes he'll come to my window

23
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,825
and bring me little dead things.

24
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,203
Look, I'm from Pontiac.

25
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,537
Huh?

26
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,705
Michigan.

27
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,210
And if I'm a water witch,
then where's the secret well?

28
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,712
You stomp too hard
and you'll fall in it.

29
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,255
Oh!

30
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,884
See?

31
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,514
It's supposed to be so deep, if you
fell to the bottom and looked up,

32
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,101
you'd see a sky full of stars
in the middle of the day.

33
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,727
Ha.

34
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,563
Surprised she let you move in.

35
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,191
My gramma, she owns the Pink Palace.

36
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,360
Won't rent to people with kids.

37
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,778
What do you mean?

38
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,489
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

39
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,449
I'm Wybie. Wybie Lovat.

40
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,867
Wybie?

41
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,577
Short for Wyborne.

42
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,246
Not my idea, of course.

43
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:55,956
What'd you get saddled with?

44
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,167
I wasn't saddled with
anything. It's Coraline.

45
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,419
Caroline what?

46
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,170
Coraline. Coraline Jones.

47
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,756
It's not real scientific,

48
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,967
but I heard an ordinary
name like Caroline

49
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,428
can lead people to have ordinary
expectations about a person.

50
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,264
Wyborne!

51
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,934
I think I heard someone
calling you, Wyborne.

52
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,603
What? I didn't hear anything.

53
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,856
I definitely heard someone,

54
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,899
Why-Were-You-Born.

55
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,985
Wyborne!

56
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,194
Grandma!

57
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,535
Well, great to meet a
Michigan water witch,

58
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,955
but I'd wear gloves next time.

59
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,331
Why?

60
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,834
'Cause that dowsing rod of yours,

61
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,294
it's poison oak.

62
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,703
I almost fell down a
well yesterday, Mom.

63
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,163
Uh-huh.

64
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,873
I would've died.

65
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,209
That's nice.

66
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,627
Hmm.

67
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,170
So, can I go out?

68
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,088
I think it's perfect
weather for gardening.

69
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,883
No, Coraline. Rain makes mud.

70
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,343
Mud makes a mess.

71
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,094
But, Mom, I want stuff growing

72
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,846
when my friends come to visit.

73
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,848
Isn't that why we moved here?

74
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,517
Something like that.

75
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,852
But then we had the accident.

76
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,687
It wasn't my fault you hit that truck.

77
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,397
I never said it was.

78
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,066
I can't believe it.

79
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,319
You and Dad get paid to write
about plants, and you hate dirt.

80
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,197
Coraline, I don't have
time for you right now,

81
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,990
and you still have unpacking to do.

82
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,867
Lots of unpacking.

83
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,453
That sounds exciting!

84
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,791
Oh. Some kid left this
on the front porch.

85
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,585
Hey, Jonesy.

86
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,462
Look what I found in Gramma's trunk.

87
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,673
Look familiar? Wybie.

88
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,760
Huh.

89
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,639
A little me? That's weird.

90
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,432
What's his name, anyway?

91
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,477
Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.

92
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,734
Hey, Dad. How's the writing going?

93
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,823
Dad!

94
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,911
Hello, Coraline and Coraline doll.

95
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,416
Do you know where the garden tools are?

96
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,335
It's... It's pouring
out there, isn't it?

97
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,380
It's just raining.

98
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,923
What'd the boss say?

99
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,510
"Don't even think about
going out, Coraline Jones!"

100
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,637
Then you won't need the tools.

101
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,069
You know, this house is 150 years old.

102
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,446
So?

103
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,197
So explore it.

104
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,076
Go out and count all the doors and
windows and write that down on...

105
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,536
List everything that's blue.

106
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,622
Just let me work.

107
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,410
Ew!

108
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,444
No. No, no, no. No.

109
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:20,155
One boring blue boy in a
painfully boring painting.

110
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,577
Four incredibly boring windows

111
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,372
and no more doors.

112
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,462
All right, little me.
Where are you hiding?

113
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,513
Huh?

114
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,771
Hey, Mom. Where does this door go?

115
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,523
I'm really, really busy.

116
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,276
I think it's locked.

117
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,569
Please!

118
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,208
Will you stop pestering
me if I do this for you?

119
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,461
Fine.

120
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,231
Bricks? I don't get it.

121
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,068
They must've closed this off
when they divided up the house.

122
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,152
You're kidding.

123
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,154
And why is the door so small?

124
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,074
We made a deal! Zip it!

125
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,410
You didn't lock it.

126
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,047
Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl

127
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,883
I think you are so nice I
give you bowls of porridge

128
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,593
And I give you bowls of ice cream

129
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,013
Why don't you ever cook, Mom?

130
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,849
Coraline, we've been
through this before.

131
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,477
Your dad cooks, I clean,
and you stay out of the way.

132
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,940
I swear I'll go food shopping
soon as we finish the catalog.

133
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,192
Try some of the chard.
You need a vegetable.

134
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,611
It looks more like slime to me.

135
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,031
Well, it's slime or bedtime, fusspot.

136
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,533
Now what's it gonna be?

137
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,077
Think they're trying to poison me?

138
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,933
Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?

139
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,485
Good night, little me.

140
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,425
Whoa!

141
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,738
Huh?

142
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,251
Mmm. Something smells good.

143
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,807
Mom? What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

144
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,476
You're just in time for supper, dear.

145
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,606
You're not my mother.

146
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,108
My mother doesn't have...

147
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,613
Buttons? Do you like them?

148
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,866
I'm your other mother, silly.

149
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,286
Now go tell your other
father that supper's ready.

150
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,874
Well, go on. He's in his study.

151
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,966
Hello?

152
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,302
Hello, Coraline.

153
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,472
Wanna hear my new song?

154
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,766
My father can't play piano.

155
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,392
No need to.

156
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,605
This piano plays me.

157
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,196
Making up
a song about Coraline

158
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,200
She's a peach, she's a
doll She's a pal of mine

159
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,078
She's as cute as a button
in the eyes of everyone

160
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:04,332
Who ever laid their eyes on Coraline

161
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,751
When she comes around exploring

162
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,628
Mom and I will never,
ever make it boring

163
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,757
Our eyes will be on Coraline

164
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:17,970
I'm sorry, but she said to
tell you the food's ready.

165
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,180
Mmm.

166
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,015
Who's starving? Raise your hand.

167
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,475
Whoa!

168
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,323
We give our thanks and ask to bless

169
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,493
our mother's golden chicken breast.

170
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,797
Mmm!

171
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,465
This chicken is good.

172
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,050
Hungry, aren't you?

173
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,427
Do you have any gravy?

174
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,763
Well, here comes the gravy train.

175
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,640
Choo, choo!

176
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,440
Huh.

177
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,944
Another roll? Sweet
peas? Corn on the cob?

178
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,489
I'm real thirsty.

179
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,742
Of course. Any requests?

180
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,619
Mango milkshake?

181
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,218
Home?

182
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,013
We've been waiting for you, Coraline.

183
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,347
For me?  Yep.

184
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,017
Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo.

185
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,810
I didn't know I had another mother.

186
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,730
Of course you do. Everyone does.

187
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,565
Really?  Uh-huh.

188
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,485
And soon as you're through
eating, I thought we'd play a game.

189
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,532
You mean like
hide-and-seek?

190
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,453
Perfect. Hide-and-seek
in the rain.

191
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,289
What rain?

192
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,584
What about the mud?

193
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,336
We love mud here.

194
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,464
Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies.

195
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,883
It's great for poison oak.

196
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,676
How'd you know I...

197
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:26,474
I... I'd love to play, but I
better get home to my other mother.

198
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,517
But I'm your other mother.

199
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,771
I mean my other, other mother.

200
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,648
Mom number one?

201
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,193
I think I should get to bed.

202
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,654
Of course, sweetheart. It's all made up.

203
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,031
But... Come along, sleepyhead.

204
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,084
Wow.

205
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,543
Hello, Coraline.

206
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,338
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

207
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,090
What's shaking, baby?

208
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,466
Hello.

209
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,392
Hey. How's it going, Loper?

210
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,394
Where's your swampers and chook?

211
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,272
Cripes almighty! How are my best trolls?

212
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,815
I can't wait till summer.

213
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,358
You're both coming, right?

214
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,943
We're already here, Coraline.

215
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,528
Gone to Oregon.

216
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,991
Oh.

217
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,076
The mud.

218
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,380
See you soon. See you soon.

219
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,910
It's gone. My poison oak! It's gone!

220
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,416
Huh.

221
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,172
It was incredibly real, Mom.

222
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,715
Only you weren't really you.

223
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,216
You were my other mother.

224
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,093
Buttons for eyes, huh?

225
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,221
Coraline, you only dreamed
you ate all that chicken.

226
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,890
Take your multivitamin at least.

227
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,224
You were in the dream, too, Dad.

228
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,519
You had wild-looking pajamas
and orange monkey slippers.

229
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,357
Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.

230
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,524
Psst.

231
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,319
Can you get me some of that
magic mud you were talking about?

232
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,364
Because I have a terrible
case of writer's rash on my...

233
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,995
If the real Charlie Jones
wants his pages edited,

234
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,289
he better wrap them up ASAP.

235
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,169
Coraline, why don't
you go visit downstairs?

236
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,881
I bet those actresses would
love to hear your dream.

237
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,050
Miss Spink and Forcible?

238
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,843
But you said they're dingbats.

239
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,220
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:25,986
Bobinsky. Bobinsky. Bobinsky.

241
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,178
Hello?

242
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,433
I think our mail got mixed up.

243
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,435
Should I leave it outside, or...

244
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,447
Hmm.

245
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,867
Secret!

246
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,371
Famous jumping mouse circus not ready,

247
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,833
little girl.

248
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,835
Circus?

249
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,044
Oh, uh...

250
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,589
I brought this for you.

251
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,597
Huh?

252
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,807
New cheese samples.

253
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:45,983
Very clever using this mix-up to
sneak my home and peek at mooshkas?

254
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,485
Mooshkas?

255
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,611
The mice!

256
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,488
Oh!

257
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,908
Sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.

258
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,827
And I am the Amazing Bobinsky.

259
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,749
But you call me Mr. B

260
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,835
because amazing I
already know that I am.

261
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,010
Ha!

262
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,930
You see, Caroline, the problem is...

263
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,849
My new songs go oompah, oompah,

264
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,603
but the jumping mice play
only toodle-toot, like that.

265
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,273
Is nice but not so much amazing.

266
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:31,028
So now, I switch to stronger
cheese and soon, watch out!

267
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:37,117
Here, have beet. Make you strong.

268
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,956
Do svidaniya, Caroline.

269
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,334
Coraline.

270
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,385
Oompah, oompah. Toodle-toot.

271
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,178
Hey, Caroline!

272
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,764
Wait!

273
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,974
No!

274
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,523
The mice asked me to give you message.

275
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,650
The jumping mice?

276
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:14,113
They are saying do not
go through little door.

277
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,366
Do you know such a thing?

278
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,910
The one behind the wallpaper?

279
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,913
But it's all bricked up.

280
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,081
Bah.

281
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,458
So sorry. Is nothing.

282
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,545
Sometimes the mice are little mixed-up.

283
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,675
They even get your name wrong, you know?

284
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,845
They call you Coraline
instead of Caroline.

285
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,847
Not Caroline at all.

286
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,932
Maybe I work them too hard.

287
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,641
Cease your infernal yapping.

288
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,810
How nice to see you, Caroline.

289
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,270
Would you like to come in?

290
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,647
We're playing cards.

291
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,815
Still Coraline, Miss Spink.

292
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,234
Miriam! Put the kettle on!

293
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,290
April, I think you're being followed.

294
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,044
It's the new neighbor, Miriam. Caroline.

295
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,797
She'll be having the oolong tea.

296
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,173
No! Oh, no, no.

297
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,592
I'm sure she'd prefer jasmine.

298
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,636
No, oolong.

299
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,347
Ah. Jasmine it is, then.

300
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,061
Come on, boys.

301
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,779
Are those dogs real?

302
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,241
Our sweet departed angels.

303
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:26,620
Couldn't bear to part with
them, so we had them stuffed.

304
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,164
Now, there's Hamish the third...

305
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,208
Go on. Have one.

306
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,919
It's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton.

307
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,380
Best in the world.

308
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,965
SPINK... the third, the ninth, yes.

309
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,550
The fourth, I'm right.

310
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,928
And Jock Jr., Jock Sr.,
Jock the third, the fourth,

311
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,348
and that's Jock's second
cousin thrice removed.

312
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,309
I'll read them if you like.

313
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,437
Read what?

314
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,605
Your tea leaves, dear.

315
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,983
They'll tell me your future.

316
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,944
Drink up then. Go on.

317
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,238
No, not all of it. Not all of it.

318
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,240
That's right. Now hand it over.

319
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,245
Oh!

320
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,414
Oh, Caroline.

321
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,542
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.

322
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,170
You are in terrible danger.

323
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,756
Oh, give me that cup, April.

324
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,466
Your eyes are going.

325
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,761
My eyes? You're blind as a bat.

326
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,181
Well, not to worry, child.

327
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,099
It's good news.

328
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:33,520
There's a tall, handsome
beast in your future.

329
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,605
A what?

330
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,023
Miriam, really.

331
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,652
You're holding it wrong. See? Danger.

332
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,029
What do you see?

333
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,115
I see a very peculiar hand.

334
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,284
I see a giraffe.

335
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,746
Giraffes don't just fall
from the sky, Miriam.

336
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,914
Oh, Lord.

337
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,459
Well, what should I do?

338
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,961
Never wear green in your dressing room.

339
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,631
Acquire a very tall stepladder.

340
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,966
And be very, very careful.

341
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,222
Now, was there something
you came to tell us?

342
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,060
No. I guess not. Thanks
for the tea, though.

343
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,228
Toodle-oo.

344
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,312
Cheery-bye.

345
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,314
Do you have
any nice queens for Mummy?

346
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,779
Danger?

347
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,675
Great! The village stalker.

348
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,009
Ow!

349
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,970
I wasn't stalking you.

350
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,847
We're hunting banana slugs.

351
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,640
What do you mean "we?"

352
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,230
Ha! Your cat's not
wild. He's a wuss puss.

353
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:01,191
What? He hates to get
his feet wet. Jeez.

354
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,609
Wuss puss.

355
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,866
So, that doll.

356
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,701
Did you make it look like me?

357
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,287
Oh, no. I found it that way.

358
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,539
It's older than Grandma.

359
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,416
Old as this house, probably.

360
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,211
Come on. Blue hair, my
swampers and raincoat?

361
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,548
Dang! Check out Slugzilla.

362
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,468
You're just like them.

363
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,970
Huh?

364
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,638
I meant my parents.

365
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,181
They don't listen to me either.

366
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,766
Uh-huh. You mind?

367
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,691
Hmm.

368
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,859
Ew!

369
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,411
You know, I've never been
inside the Pink Palace.

370
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,121
You're kidding.

371
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,789
Grandma'd kill me.

372
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,751
Thinks it's dangerous or something.

373
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,336
Dangerous?

374
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,922
Well, she had a twin sister.

375
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,381
So?

376
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,718
When they were kids,
Grandma's sister disappeared.

377
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,845
She says she was stolen.

378
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,680
Stolen?

379
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,184
Well, what do you think?

380
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,562
I don't know. Maybe she just ran away.

381
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,689
Wyborne!

382
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,650
Look, I gotta go.

383
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,109
Wait a minute.

384
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,228
Welcome back, darling.

385
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,396
Hi.

386
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,025
So thoughtful of you to send
this nice cheddar, Coraline.

387
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,737
Cheddar? Oh! The mice bait.

388
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,197
Would you go fetch your father?

389
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,242
I bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now.

390
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,202
You mean my other father.

391
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,829
Your better father, dear.

392
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,289
He's out in the garden.

393
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,291
But my parents don't
have time to garden.

394
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,878
Mmm!

395
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,463
Go on.

396
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,432
Hey.

397
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,393
I love your garden!

398
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,396
Our garden, Coraline.

399
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,528
Stop tickling me!

400
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,323
Daughter in distress.

401
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,422
Tickle no more, you dragon snappers.

402
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:41,429
Well, she says it's time
for dinner, breakfast, food.

403
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,056
Hop on, kiddo.

404
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,599
I wanna show you something.

405
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,320
I can't believe you did this.

406
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,239
Mother said you'd like it.

407
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,534
Boy, she knows you like
the back of her hand.

408
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,789
Mmm. So good.

409
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,417
I love
dinner-breakfast-food.

410
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,669
Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you

411
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,422
to come see the jumping
mice perform after dinner.

412
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,549
Really? That
know-it-all Wybie

413
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,676
said it was all in Mr. B's head.

414
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,969
I knew he was wrong.

415
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,722
Well, everything's right
in this world, kiddo.

416
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,348
Your father and I will clean up

417
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,852
while you and your friend head upstairs.

418
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,312
My friend?

419
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,774
Great. Another Wybie.

420
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,611
Hello,
Why-Were-You-Born.

421
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,697
Hello!

422
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,952
I thought you'd like him more if he
spoke a little less. So I fixed him.

423
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,164
So he can't talk at all?

424
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,957
Nope. Hmm.

425
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,876
I like it.

426
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,629
Now, run along, you two, and have fun.

427
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:03,136
You're awful cheerful considering
you can't say anything.

428
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,433
It didn't hurt, did it, when she...

429
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,031
Whoa!

430
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,660
Cool!

431
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,762
Look at you!

432
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:53,770
Lady and gentleman,
for to tickle your eyes and ears

433
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,856
and making hearts to thump,

434
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,652
I, Sergei Alexander Bobinsky,

435
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:04,072
am introducing my astoundishing,

436
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,827
stupendulous and amazing

437
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,580
jumping mouse circus!

438
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,419
My name!

439
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,985
It's wonderful, Wybie.

440
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,210
Wow!

441
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,775
Yahoo! That was great!

442
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:26,279
Very, very thank you,
lady and gentleman.

443
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:46,466
We loved it, Mr. B. It was so... So...

444
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,884
Ah...

445
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,135
Amazing!

446
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,846
You are very welcome anytime you like.

447
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,641
You and also your good friend there.

448
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,394
Do svedaniya, Coraline.

449
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,939
There were garden
squash like balloon animals

450
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,524
and snapdragons.

451
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,652
Oh, and upstairs, I
saw a real mouse circus.

452
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,238
Not pretend like the
crazy man's in our house.

453
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,948
You sure you won't come?

454
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,116
Don't fret, Charlie.

455
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,868
They'll love the new catalog.

456
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,953
At least they'll love my chapters.

457
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,663
I did not call him crazy, Coraline.

458
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,415
He's drunk.

459
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,918
Well, I guess I'll see you
around, you dizzy dreamer.

460
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,796
Dad! I'm not five anymore.

461
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:36,159
My kingdom for a horse!

462
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,173
Put them back.

463
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,217
But, Mom, the whole school's

464
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,427
gonna wear boring gray clothes.

465
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,095
No one will have these.

466
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,139
Put them back.

467
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,060
My other mother would get them.

468
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,771
Maybe she should buy all your clothes.

469
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,361
So what do you think
is in the other apartment?

470
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,029
I don't know.

471
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,948
Not a family of Jones imposters.

472
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,076
Then why'd you lock the door?

473
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,497
I found some rat crap, and
I thought you'd feel safer.

474
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:27,544
They're jumping mice, Mom, and
the dreams aren't dangerous.

475
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,672
They're the most fun I've
had since we've moved here.

476
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,173
Your school might be fun.

477
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,926
With those stupid uniforms? Right.

478
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,096
Had to give it a try.

479
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,194
How do you feel about a mustard,

480
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,321
ketchup, salsa wrap for lunch?

481
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,156
Are you kidding me?

482
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,534
Had to go food shopping, anyway.

483
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,370
Dad's planning something special.

484
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,289
Grossgusting.

485
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,456
You wanna come along?

486
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,166
You can pick out something you like.

487
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,210
Oh. Like the gloves.

488
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:15,341
Look, Coraline, if things go well
today, I promise I'll make it up.

489
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,011
That's what you always say.

490
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,807
Won't be long.

491
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,685
But I might be.

492
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,894
I knew it was real.

493
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,002
Dearest Coraline,

494
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:37,215
Miss Spink and Miss Forcible have
invited you downstairs after lunch.

495
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,592
I hope you like the
new outfit I made you.

496
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,511
Love, Mother.

497
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,441
Wybie's got a cat like you at home.

498
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,613
Not the quiet Wybie. The
one that talks too much.

499
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,908
You must be the other cat.

500
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:07,995
No, I'm not the other anything. I'm me.

501
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,374
Um... I can see you
don't have button eyes,

502
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,044
but if you're the same
cat, how can you talk?

503
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,630
I just can.

504
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,049
Cats don't talk at home.

505
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,509
No? Nope.

506
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:25,346
Well, you're clearly the
expert on these things.

507
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,975
After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss.

508
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,352
Come back. Please?

509
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,230
I'm sorry I called
you that. I really am.

510
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,565
How'd you get here?

511
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,317
I've been coming here for a while.

512
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,239
It's a game we play.

513
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,702
She hates cats and tries to keep me out,

514
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,287
but she can't, of course.

515
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,581
I come and go as I please.

516
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,583
The other mother hates cats?

517
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,753
Not like any mother I've ever known.

518
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,172
What do you mean? She's amazing.

519
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:05,094
You probably think this world is a
dream come true, but you're wrong.

520
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,472
The other Wybie told me so.

521
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,724
That's nonsense. He can't talk.

522
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,893
Perhaps not to you.

523
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:16,314
We cats, however, have far
superior senses than humans,

524
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,775
and can see and smell and...

525
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,485
Shh!

526
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:25,031
I hear something. Right over...

527
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,448
Hey, Wybie.

528
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,673
She's practically naked!

529
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:27,718
I'm known as
the siren of all seven seas

530
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:31,514
The breaker of hearts by the bay

531
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:35,601
So if you go swimming
With bowlegged women

532
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,856
I might steal your weak heart away

533
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,870
Oh, my God.

534
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,999
A big-bottomed sea
witch May bob through the waves

535
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,627
And hope to lead sailors astray

536
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:07,258
But a true ocean goddess
Must fill out her bodice

537
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:12,513
To present an alluring display

538
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:22,231
Beware of old oysters
too large in the chest

539
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:26,068
Let's banish them from the buffet

540
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,154
I'm far more nutritious

541
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,406
You smell like the fishes

542
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,575
Did I hear a banshee?

543
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,994
You're sea green with envy

544
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,246
This mermaid enchantress

545
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,791
No, I, Birth of Venus

546
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,586
Will send sailors swooning...

547
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,673
Will send sailors swooning all day

548
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,909
I can't look.

549
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:18,537
Ready to break a leg, Miriam?

550
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,916
Our lives for the theater, April.

551
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,397
"What
a piece of work is man!

552
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,274
"How noble in reason!"

553
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,485
"How infinite in faculty."

554
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:53,948
"In form, in moving how
express and admirable!"

555
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,742
"In action like an angel."

556
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:01,706
"In
apprehension how like a god!"

557
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,752
"The
beauty of the world!"

558
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,924
"The paragon of animals!"

559
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,179
Yeah!

560
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,090
Hey, there.

561
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,884
Was it wonderful, dear?

562
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,179
Oh, yeah. They swooped down and
pulled me right out of my seat,

563
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,598
Spink and Forcible, only
they weren't old ladies.

564
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,183
That was just a disguise.

565
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,311
But then, I was flying
through the air, and it was...

566
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,896
It was magic.

567
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,190
You do like it here,
don't you, Coraline?

568
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,691
Uh-huh.

569
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,443
Good night, Wybie.

570
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,831
You could stay here
forever if you want to.

571
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,917
Really? Sure.

572
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:31,712
We'll sing and play games, and
Mother will cook your favorite meals.

573
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,340
There's one tiny little
thing we need to do.

574
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,591
What's that?

575
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,967
Well, it's a surprise.

576
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,682
For you, our little doll.

577
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,398
Black is traditional.

578
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:57,988
But if you'd prefer pink or
vermillion or chartreuse...

579
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,534
Though you
might make me jealous.

580
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,701
No way!

581
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,745
You're not sewing buttons in my eyes!

582
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,957
But we need a "yes" if
you want to stay here.

583
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,792
So sharp you won't feel a...

584
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,085
Ow!

585
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,840
There, now. It's your decision, darling.

586
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,135
We only want what's best for you.

587
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,428
I'm going to bed. Right now!

588
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,555
Bed?

589
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,764
Before dinner?

590
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,433
I'm really, really tired. Yeah.

591
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,646
I just need to sleep on things.

592
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,148
Well, of course you do, darling.

593
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,732
I'll be happy to tuck you in.

594
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,859
Oh, no, thanks.

595
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,569
You've done so much already.

596
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,697
You're welcome. And I...

597
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:44,034
We aren't worried at all, darling.

598
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,413
Soon
you'll see things our way.

599
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,473
What's wrong, Coraline?

600
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,100
Don't you wanna play?

601
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,770
Yeah! I wanna hug your face!

602
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,023
GIRAFFE Get a grip, soldier!

603
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,316
Hey! Hey!

604
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,526
Where's your buttons, Loper?

605
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,695
You want to stay, don't you?

606
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:24,491
Going home tonight,
robots, and I won't be back.

607
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,750
Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

608
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,043
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

609
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,502
A tiny
little thing we need to do.

610
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,962
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

611
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,714
So sharp
you won't feel a thing.

612
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,882
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

613
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,759
Soon
you'll see things our way.

614
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,978
Mom! Dad!

615
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:57,858
Oh, God. I'm still here?

616
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,960
Hey, you!

617
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,462
Where's the other mother?

618
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,089
I wanna go home.

619
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:23,717
All will be swell, soon
as Mother's refreshed.

620
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,011
Her strength is our strength.

621
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,977
Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

622
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,270
If you won't even talk to me,

623
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,188
I'm gonna find the other Wybie.

624
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,148
He'll help me. No point.

625
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:42,611
He pulled a long face,
and Mother didn't like it.

626
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,264
And what do you think you're doing?

627
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,600
Well, I'm getting out of here.

628
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,644
That's what I'm doing.

629
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,563
Huh?

630
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,231
Something's wrong.

631
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,983
Shouldn't the old well be here?

632
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,068
Nothing out here.

633
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,571
It's the empty part of this world.

634
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,991
She only made what she
knew would impress you.

635
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,952
But why? Why does she want me?

636
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,372
She wants something to love, I think.

637
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,916
Something that isn't her.

638
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:42,629
Or maybe she'd just
love something to eat.

639
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,174
Eat? That's ridiculous.

640
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:47,343
Mothers don't eat daughters.

641
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,054
I don't know. How do you taste?

642
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,520
Huh?

643
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:04,276
But how can you walk away from
something and still come back to it?

644
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,280
Walk around the world.

645
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,573
Small world.

646
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,117
Hang on.

647
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,249
Stop! He's one of the circus mice!

648
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,428
I don't like rats at the best of times,

649
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,473
but this one was sounding an alarm.

650
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,769
Good kitty.

651
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:20,727
They say even the proudest
spirit can be broken with love.

652
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:29,486
Of course, chocolate
never hurts. Like one?

653
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,283
They're cocoa beetles from Zanzibar.

654
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:42,624
I want to be with my real mom and dad.

655
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,294
I want you to let me go.

656
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,423
Is that any way to talk to your mother?

657
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,050
You aren't my mother.

658
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:56,305
Apologize at once, Coraline!

659
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,307
No!

660
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:02,436
I'll give you to the count of three.

661
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,606
One.

662
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,358
Two.

663
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:11,862
Three!

664
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,113
Ow!

665
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,909
What are you doing? Ow! That hurts!

666
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:23,999
You may come out when you've
learned to be a loving daughter.

667
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,554
Who's there?

668
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,599
TALL GIRL Hush! And shush.

669
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,268
For the beldam might be listening.

670
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,814
You... You mean the other mother?

671
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,619
Who are you?

672
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,706
Don't remember our names,

673
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,960
but I 'member my true mommy.

674
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,463
Why are you all here?

675
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,090
GHOST The beldam.

676
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:18,971
She spied on our lives
through the little doll's eyes.

677
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,641
And saw that we weren't happy.

678
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:27,229
So she lured us away with
treasures. And treats.

679
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,398
SWEET GIRL And games to play.

680
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,733
BOY Gave all that we asked.

681
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,278
SWEET GIRL Yet
we still wanted more.

682
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,156
TALL GIRL So we
let her sew the buttons.

683
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,996
BOY She said that she loved us.

684
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,582
But she locked us here.

685
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:50,002
GHOST And ate up our lives.

686
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:57,092
Well, she can't keep
me in the dark forever.

687
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,345
Not if she wants to win my life.

688
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,641
Beating her is my only chance.

689
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:08,437
Perhaps, if you do win your escape,

690
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,606
you could find our eyes.

691
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,941
Has she taken those, too?

692
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,777
Yes, miss. And hidden them.

693
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:19,364
BOY Find our eyes, mistress,
and our souls will be freed.

694
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,701
I...

695
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,119
I'll try.

696
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,045
Wybie?

697
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,216
Did she do this to you?

698
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,391
I hope that feels... Shh!

699
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,734
Coraline? Is that you?

700
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,069
Let's go!

701
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,491
Coraline!

702
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,078
Come on! She'll hurt you again.

703
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,085
Coraline!

704
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,045
How dare you disobey your mother!

705
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,509
Coraline!

706
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,609
I'm home!

707
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,155
Anybody here?

708
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,535
Hello? Hello, hello!

709
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,870
Real Dad?

710
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,540
Real Mom?

711
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,959
Oh, Mom's groceries!

712
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:57,671
Ugh!

713
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,840
That's disgusting.

714
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:05,470
I missed you guys so
much, you'll never...

715
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,182
Oh. The Wybie that talks.

716
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,267
Huh?

717
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:15,772
Yeah, so, you know that
old doll I gave you?

718
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,190
Um...

719
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,525
My grandma's real mad.

720
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,610
Says it was her sister's.

721
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,903
The one that disappeared.

722
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,239
You stole that doll, didn't you?

723
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:27,075
Well, it looked just
like you, and I figured...

724
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,246
It used to look like this
pioneer girl, then Huck Finn Jr.,

725
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,081
then it was this Little Rascals chick

726
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,751
with all these ribbons and braids and...

727
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,919
Grandma's missing sister.

728
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,172
I think I just met her. Come on.

729
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,925
Listen, I'm really not supposed to...

730
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,051
Whoa!

731
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,016
She's in there.

732
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,604
Can you... Can you unlock it?

733
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,022
Not in a million years.

734
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,523
But it wouldn't matter.

735
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,358
She can't escape without her eyes.

736
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,277
None of the ghosts can.

737
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,532
Yeah. So I really need to get that doll.

738
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,202
Great! I'd love to get rid of it.

739
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,414
Where are you hiding,
you little monster?

740
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:15,916
You and Grandma been talking?

741
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,626
The doll's her spy.

742
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:21,129
It's how she watches you, finds
out what's wrong with your life.

743
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,465
The doll is my grandma's spy?

744
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,133
No. The other mother.

745
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,803
She's got this whole world
where everything's better.

746
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,972
The food, the garden, the neighbors.

747
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,558
But it's all a trap.

748
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:38,021
Yeah, I think I heard
someone calling me, Jonesy.

749
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,982
Don't believe me? You can ask the cat.

750
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,234
The cat?

751
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,070
I'll just tell Grandma that
you couldn't find the doll.

752
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,196
Ow!

753
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,739
You're not listening to me!

754
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,659
That's 'cause you're crazy!

755
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,290
You creep!

756
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,583
Crazy!

757
01:03:58,668 --> 01:03:59,709
Crazy?

758
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,754
You're the jerk wad
that gave me the doll!

759
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,298
Mom! Dad!

760
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,559
Pick it up, Dad. Pick it up.

761
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,479
DAD ON ANSWERING
Hi! Dad! Where...

762
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,189
I'm digging in my garden right now,

763
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,025
but leave a message and
I'll get right back to you.

764
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,986
Where have you gone?

765
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,997
Uh... Don't you only make
wings for the dead ones?

766
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,040
Just looking ahead, dear.

767
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,668
Angus hasn't been
feeling very well of late.

768
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:43,879
April? Aren't
you getting ready?

769
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,131
We've lost our ride, Miriam.

770
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,718
Caroline says her parents
have vanished quite completely.

771
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:50,927
What?

772
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,430
We've waited months for those tickets.

773
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,473
I suppose we could walk.

774
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,225
With your gammy legs?

775
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,145
It's nearly two miles to the theater.

776
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,818
Oh, yes. Your missing parents.

777
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,654
We know just what you need.

778
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,741
Miriam, get... That's right.

779
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,829
How is 100-year-old
candy gonna help?

780
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,470
There you go, sweetie.

781
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,097
What's it for?

782
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,599
Well, it might help.

783
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,935
They're good for bad things sometimes.

784
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:43,063
No. They're good for lost things.

785
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:45,273
It's bad things, Miriam.

786
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,734
Lost things, April. Bad.

787
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,653
Lost.  Bad things.

788
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:53,073
Lost. Bad.

789
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,282
Lost!

790
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,561
Good night, Mom.

791
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,064
Good night, Dad.

792
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:58,596
Hello. How did you get in?

793
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,600
Do you know where Mom and Dad are?

794
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,490
Mom? Dad!

795
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:39,512
How did this happen?

796
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,567
She's taken them.

797
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,025
They're not coming back, are they?

798
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,693
Mom and Dad.

799
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,987
Not on their own.

800
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,825
Only one thing to do.

801
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,235
You know, you're walking
right into her trap.

802
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,821
I have to go back.

803
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,824
They are my parents.

804
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,411
Challenge her, then.

805
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,664
She may not play fair,
but she won't refuse.

806
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,250
She's got a thing for games.

807
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,169
Hmm.

808
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,004
Okay.

809
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,009
Coraline?

810
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,510
Mom?

811
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,346
Coraline! You came back for us.

812
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,598
Mom!

813
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:53,062
Darling, why would you run away from me?

814
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,361
Where are my parents?

815
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:04,490
Gosh, I have no idea
where your old parents are.

816
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:07,535
Perhaps they've grown bored
of you and run away to France.

817
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,038
They weren't bored
of me. You stole them!

818
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:13,041
Now, don't be difficult, Coraline.

819
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,126
Have a seat, won't you?

820
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,224
Mmm.

821
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:36,648
Why don't you have your own key?

822
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,775
Only one key.

823
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,984
Shh!

824
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:43,655
The garden squash need tending,
don't you think, pumpkin?

825
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:48,117
Squish-squash, pumpkin sauce.

826
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,872
Mom?

827
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,041
Dad?

828
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:57,669
Where'd she hide you?

829
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,546
Breakfast time!

830
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,513
Be strong, Coraline.

831
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:25,905
Why don't we play a game?

832
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,991
I know you like them.

833
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,993
Everybody likes games.

834
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,036
Uh-huh.

835
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,205
What kind of game would it be?

836
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,625
An exploring game. A
finding things game.

837
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,546
And what is it you'd
be finding, Coraline?

838
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,631
My real parents.

839
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:45,466
Too easy.

840
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,219
And the eyes of the ghost children.

841
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:50,972
Huh.

842
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,516
What if you don't find them?

843
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,562
If I lose, I'll stay here with
you forever and let you love me.

844
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:02,692
And I'll let you sew
buttons into my eyes.

845
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,193
Hmm.

846
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:07,822
And if you somehow win this game?

847
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:10,491
Then you let me go. You let everyone go.

848
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,160
My real father and mother,

849
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:14,912
the dead children, everyone
you've trapped here.

850
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:17,832
Deal.

851
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,752
Not till you give me a clue.

852
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,004
Oh, right.

853
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:27,842
In each of three wonders
I've made just for you,

854
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:31,346
a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight.

855
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,807
And for my parents?

856
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,438
Fine. Don't tell me.

857
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:45,276
It's a deal.

858
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:56,537
What does she mean, "wonders?"

859
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,128
Hmm.

860
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,396
Ugh!

861
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,577
No!

862
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:58,808
Stop!

863
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:17,869
Why steal this?

864
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,123
Wow!

865
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,716
That must be it!

866
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,889
Sorry.

867
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:43,895
So sorry. Mother making me.

868
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:48,566
Don't wanna hurt you!

869
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,576
Take it!

870
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,425
Bless you, miss. You found me!

871
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:17,178
But there's two eyes still lost.

872
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,516
Don't worry. I'm getting the hang of it.

873
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,185
The pearl.

874
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,189
Thief! Thief!

875
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,275
Give it back! Give it back!

876
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:55,443
Thief! Thief!

877
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:56,777
Give it back!

878
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,447
Thief! Thief!

879
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:00,906
Give it back! Thief!

880
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,533
Thief! Give it back!

881
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,659
Give it back! Thief!

882
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,578
Give it back! Give it back!

883
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:06,829
Thief!

884
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,582
Thief! Thief!

885
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,126
Stop! Stop! Thief! Thief!

886
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,753
Thief! Stop!

887
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:24,930
Hurry on, girl. Her web is unwinding.

888
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:43,074
Oh, Wybie.

889
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:47,787
Evil witch! I'm not scared!

890
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:08,391
Hello, galoobooshka.

891
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:10,059
I'm Coraline.

892
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:15,272
Is this what you're looking for?

893
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,025
Uh-huh.

894
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:21,987
You think winning game is good thing?

895
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:29,745
You'll just go home and
be bored and neglected,

896
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:35,543
same as always. Stay here with us.

897
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:40,673
We will listen to you
and laugh with you.

898
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:54,979
If you stay here, you can
have whatever you want.

899
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:57,898
Always!

900
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,693
You don't get it, do you?

901
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:03,320
I don't understand.

902
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,906
Of course you don't understand.

903
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,534
You're just a copy she
made of the real Mr. B.

904
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:13,122
Not even that anymore.

905
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:28,929
No!

906
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:46,655
No!

907
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:11,555
Oh, God. I've lost the game.

908
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,474
I've lost everything.

909
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:27,905
I think I mentioned that I don't
like rats at the best of times.

910
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:32,660
I think you might have
said something like that.

911
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:35,663
It looked like you
needed this one, however.

912
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,415
Thank you.

913
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,297
I'm heading inside.

914
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,091
I still have to find my parents.

915
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,785
Come on, quickly!

916
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,040
So you're back.

917
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,460
And you brought vermin with you.

918
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,838
No. I...

919
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,133
I brought a friend.

920
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:15,054
You know I love you.

921
01:22:19,517 --> 01:22:23,062
You have a very funny way of showing it.

922
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:29,109
So where are they? The ghost eyes?

923
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:39,453
Hold on. We aren't finished yet. Are we?

924
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,830
No, I suppose not.

925
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:47,878
After all, you still need to
find your old parents, don't you?

926
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:52,758
Too bad you won't have this.

927
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:04,770
Be clever, miss.

928
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:07,439
Even if you win,
she'll never let you go!

929
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,993
I already know where you've hidden them.

930
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:23,372
Well, produce them.

931
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,334
They're behind that door.

932
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:30,295
Oh, they are, are they?

933
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,558
There.

934
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,146
Mom. Dad.

935
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:56,655
Go on. Open it. They'll
be there, all right.

936
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:03,537
You're wrong, Coraline.
They aren't there.

937
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:10,753
Now you're going to stay here forever.

938
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:14,673
No, I'm not!

939
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:28,812
No!

940
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:34,401
You horrible cheating girl!

941
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:56,799
No! Where are you?

942
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:59,051
You selfish brat!

943
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,279
You dare disobey your mother?

944
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:26,912
Please shut it!

945
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:46,181
Don't
leave me! Don't leave me!

946
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:49,059
I'll die without you!

947
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:21,675
Coraline, we're home.

948
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:23,969
Mom! Dad! I missed you so much!

949
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:26,221
Missed us?

950
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:29,266
Oh, no. You broke my
favorite snow globe.

951
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,517
I didn't break it.

952
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,186
It must've broke when you escaped.

953
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,353
And cut your knee.

954
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:36,064
Coraline, I asked you
to count all the windows,

955
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:37,691
not put your knee through them.

956
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:38,859
But...

957
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:41,069
Well, get yourself cleaned
up. We're going out tonight.

958
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,198
We got a lot to celebrate.

959
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,534
You're talking about
your garden catalog?

960
01:26:48,077 --> 01:26:50,495
Of course. What else?

961
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:53,165
But look
at the snow on your...

962
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:55,626
What's gotten into you, Coraline?

963
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,559
So, gonna order the tulips?

964
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:13,727
What's that?

965
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,395
For the garden party?

966
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,981
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

967
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:21,902
Dad! So, Ma, invitations?

968
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:23,320
Don't forget the invitations.

969
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:24,905
Even Bobinsky?

970
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:29,493
Mr. B.'s not drunk,
Mom. He's just eccentric.

971
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,163
Good night, Coraline.

972
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,017
Oh.

973
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:55,644
Hello again.

974
01:27:56,854 --> 01:27:58,355
You still mad?

975
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:03,360
I'm really sorry I threw
you at her, the other mother.

976
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,822
It was all I could think of.

977
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:23,463
I think it's time, don't you?

978
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,049
To set them free?

979
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:51,950
It's a fine, fine thing
you did for us, miss.

980
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:55,495
Well, I'm glad it's finally over.

981
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:00,500
It is over and done with for us.

982
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,502
What about me?

983
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,671
You're in terrible danger, girl!

984
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,341
But how? I locked the door!

985
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:09,009
It's the key, miss.

986
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:11,386
There's only one, and
the beldam will find it.

987
01:29:13,222 --> 01:29:15,390
'Tain't all bad, miss.

988
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:20,687
Thou art alive. Thou art still living.

989
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:35,285
I gotta hide this somewhere,
somewhere she can never...

990
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,628
Out of my way!

991
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:05,357
Oh, my twitchy-witchy
girl I think you are so nice

992
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:10,695
I give you bowls of porridge
and I give you bowls of ice cream

993
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:14,908
I give you lots of kisses

994
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,620
And I give you lots of hugs

995
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,790
But I never give you sandwiches

996
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:24,251
Wth grease and worms and mung...

997
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:27,003
...beans

998
01:31:58,095 --> 01:31:59,846
I'm really sorry I didn't believe you

999
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:03,475
about all this evil stuff, Coraline.

1000
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:07,187
Why did you change your mind?

1001
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:11,149
Well, Grandma showed me this
picture after I called you crazy.

1002
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:15,695
It's her and her sister,
before she disappeared.

1003
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,614
The Sweet Ghost Girl.

1004
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:21,368
Wyborne! Come home!

1005
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:25,413
Oh, man. What am I gonna tell her?

1006
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:29,167
Just bring her by the house tomorrow.

1007
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:30,919
We can tell her together.

1008
01:32:31,003 --> 01:32:33,380
We... We can?

1009
01:32:33,464 --> 01:32:36,424
You know, I'm glad you
decided to stalk me.

1010
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,053
It wasn't my idea.

1011
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:09,249
Thanks for helping
me, Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.

1012
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:12,544
Oh, look, April. Pink ladies!

1013
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:14,588
Actually, it's just lemonade.

1014
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,298
How's Angus doing?

1015
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:21,177
Oh, much better, dear, but he
can't duck his wings forever.

1016
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:22,971
Here comes a burp.

1017
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:24,598
Charlie!

1018
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:28,602
Excusez-moi, but that
pizza, that was delicious.

1019
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:30,353
Cold drinks?

1020
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:31,771
Oh, yeah. Great.

1021
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:35,358
You were right, Coraline.
I really hate dirt!

1022
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,820
But the tulips look nice.

1023
01:33:38,904 --> 01:33:40,530
Thanks, Mom.

1024
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:47,287
That is possible.

1025
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:52,042
How are the mooshkas, Mr. B?

1026
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:55,462
They tell me that you
are savior, Caroline.

1027
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:57,130
And soon as they are ready,

1028
01:33:57,214 --> 01:34:00,634
they wish to give special
thanks you performance.

1029
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:04,763
Wyborne, I know where I'm going.

1030
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,640
I grew up here.

1031
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:08,475
Welcome, Miss Lovat!

1032
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:11,561
Oh. Hello.

1033
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,773
I'm Coraline Jones.

1034
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:16,650
I've got so much to tell you.

1035
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:19,027
Here. Thanks.

1036
01:34:19,111 --> 01:34:21,154
Do you want to pop
a little gin in it, dear?

1037
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:22,572
Of course.
