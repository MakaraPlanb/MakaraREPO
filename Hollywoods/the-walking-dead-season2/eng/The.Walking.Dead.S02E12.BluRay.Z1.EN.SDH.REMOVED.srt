1
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:19,185
Dale could get under your skin.

2
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,439
He sure got under mine,

3
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,152
because he wasn't afraid
to say exactly what he thought,

4
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,364
how he felt.

5
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,578
That kind
of honesty is rare

6
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,792
and brave.

7
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,922
Whenever I'd make
a decision,

8
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,844
I'd look at Dale.

9
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,765
He'd be looking back at me
with that look he had.

10
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,729
We've all seen it
one time or another.

11
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,695
I couldn't always read him,
but he could read us.

12
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,284
He saw people
for who they were.

13
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,412
He knew things about us--

14
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,373
the truth,

15
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,501
who we really are.

16
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,590
In the end, he was talking
about losing our humanity.

17
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,802
He said this group
was broken.

18
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,350
The best way to honor him
is to unbreak it.

19
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,395
Set aside our differences
and pull together,

20
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,107
stop feeling sorry
for ourselves

21
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,902
and take control
of our lives,

22
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,322
our safety...

23
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,365
...our future.

24
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,618
We're not broken.

25
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,037
We're gonna
prove him wrong.

26
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,339
From now on

27
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:14,008
we're gonna
do it his way.

28
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,595
That is how
we honor Dale.

29
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,124
Gonna be tight,
14 people in one house.

30
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,293
Don't worry about that.

31
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,920
With the swamp hardening,
the creek drying up...

32
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,839
With 50 head of cattle
on the property,

33
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,924
we might as well be ringing
a damn dinner bell.

34
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,511
She's right. We should've
moved you in a while ago.

35
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,432
All right, let's move
the vehicles near each of the doors

36
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,350
- facing out toward the road.
- Just leave it there.

37
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,102
We'll build
a lookout in the windmill,

38
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,563
another in the barn loft.
That should give us sightlines

39
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,189
both sides of the property.

40
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,151
T-Dog, you take the perimeter
around the house.

41
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,611
Keep track of everyone
coming and going.

42
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,945
What about standing guard?

43
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,281
I need you and Daryl
on double duty.

44
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,074
Gotcha.

45
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,453
I'll stock the basement
with food and water,

46
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,831
enough that we can all survive
there a few days if need be.

47
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,291
What about patrols?

48
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,709
Let's get this area
locked down first.

49
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,836
After that,
Shane'll assign shifts

50
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,798
while me and Daryl take Randall
offsite and cut him loose.

51
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,427
We're back to that now?

52
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,347
It was the right plan
first time around.

53
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,057
Poor execution.

54
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,642
That's a slight understatement.

55
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,061
You don't agree,
but this is what's happening.

56
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,355
Swallow it. Move on.

57
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,523
You know that Dale's death
and the prisoner--

58
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,859
that's two separate things, right?

59
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,696
You wanna take Daryl
as your wingman,

60
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,949
be my guest.

61
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,118
- Thank you.
- You got it.

62
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,644
I see why you're not
taking Shane with you.

63
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:16,315
Just know I've got no more
patience where he's concerned.

64
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,609
He's turning over a new leaf.

65
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,322
Andrea.

66
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,158
When I'm out with Daryl,

67
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,828
help Hershel keep an eye
on things around here.

68
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,955
Me?

69
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,499
Shane's got a way of letting things
get out of hand,

70
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,252
especially when
he's all torqued up.

71
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,921
I think we're all
a bit torqued up at this point.

72
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,049
If you're staying here permanently,
he's got to understand

73
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,553
that it's what Rick and I say,
not whatever he wants.

74
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,639
- You've become close.
- We talk.

75
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,558
Then you know
he's not a bad guy.

76
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,727
He's just
his own worst enemy.

77
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,979
You want me
to babysit Shane?

78
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,857
I need to make sure
every time I leave the farm

79
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,400
all hell doesn't break loose.

80
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,111
Then maybe
you should stop leaving.

81
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,949
- Will you keep an eye on things?
- Of course.

82
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,130
- Hey, Shane?
- What's up, man?

83
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,966
What you doing,
wandering around by yourself?

84
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,595
If, um--
if I tell you something,

85
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,764
will you promise
not to tell my parents?

86
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,476
I think it's probably a bad idea
for both of us, bud.

87
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,860
Hey, Carl.

88
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,779
Why don't you come on back?

89
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,664
Go on.

90
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,463
I took it from Daryl's motorcycle.

91
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,965
If he found out I took it,
he'd kill me.

92
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,220
What were you doing
with this?

93
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,103
Dale. It's my fault
that he died.

94
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,815
Carl, why would you say that, man?
He got bit by a walker.

95
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,608
- Why are you saying that?
- I saw that walker.

96
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,693
I was gonna shoot it.

97
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,327
It was stuck in the mud.

98
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,539
I was-- I was throwing
rocks at it and stuff.

99
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,251
But I was gonna do it--
shoot it right in the head.

100
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,462
And it-- it got free,
came after me and...

101
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,092
I ran away. If I had killed it,
Dale would still be here.

102
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,802
Carl, I want you
to stop that, okay?

103
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,596
This ain't your fault.

104
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,765
But you need
to hold onto this.

105
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,017
You need
to protect yourself.

106
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,438
As long as I'm around you,
nothing's gonna happen to you, Carl.

107
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,691
But I can't keep
my eyes on you 24/7.

108
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,693
Only you can do that.
Carl, take it.

109
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,444
I'm never touching
another gun again.

110
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,197
- That ain't an option, Carl, okay?
- Just give it back to Daryl.

111
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,956
The men are in there.

112
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,633
You can put your stuff
upstairs in my room.

113
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,719
With your dad
in the house?

114
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,642
I just-- I'm just gonna
put my stuff over there.

115
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,114
Whoa. Don't--don't--
don't strain yourself.

116
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,784
Thank you.

117
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,954
Rick and Carl and I are taking
the corner of the living room.

118
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,290
You can put that
in my room.

119
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,252
You'll be
more comfortable there.

120
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,628
We can't do that.

121
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,713
A pregnant woman and child
sleeping on the floor

122
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,633
- while I've got a bed to myself?
- This is still your house.

123
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,470
It's our home.
I'll take the couch downstairs.

124
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,139
On nights when I came home
reeking of bourbon,

125
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,725
my wife would lock
the bedroom door.

126
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,771
I'm sad to say that couch
and I become old friends.

127
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,190
If you two can't decide,
I'll take it.

128
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,236
Thank you.

129
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,154
The couch is mine.

130
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:18,200
It's gonna get real cozy
real fast in here.

131
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,637
Wouldn't that be easier
if you waited for some help?

132
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,266
Ain't no use waiting for
something that ain't gonna come.

133
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,893
No, I'll just--

134
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,229
just do it all myself.

135
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,149
Yeah, you always do,

136
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,027
just like that time you showed up
Rick fixing our sink.

137
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,487
Yeah.

138
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,699
Just so you know, that's not the reason
your basement flooded.

139
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,285
You can thank Rick
for that--

140
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,580
using rubber washers
with a metal pipe.

141
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,166
Please come down.

142
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:26,268
So after Sophia, I--

143
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,065
I thought
we'll figure this out.

144
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:35,652
You know,
we'll heal somehow.

145
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,574
After Dale?

146
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,121
This is real.

147
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,335
And we can't...

148
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,171
keep it at bay.
It's already got us.

149
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,385
And it just
keeps coming, doesn't it?

150
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,682
I made a mess of things.

151
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,435
I put you and Rick at odds.

152
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,481
I don't even know
whose baby this is.

153
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,071
I can't imagine
how hard that is on you.

154
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,453
You led us out of Atlanta
with no thought for yourself.

155
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,125
Do you remember that night?

156
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,169
The flames, the--

157
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,923
and I'm sitting in your car

158
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,676
thinking, "We're gonna
be all right.

159
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,554
He's gonna make it all right.
We'll get out of here."

160
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,182
And I never
thanked you for that.

161
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,146
Even though things got...

162
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,066
confused between us,

163
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,112
you were there for me.

164
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,200
You were there for me.
Thank you.

165
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,332
You don't need
to thank me for that.

166
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,335
- Of course I do. Of course I do.
- No, you--

167
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,089
Whatever happened
between us,

168
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,134
whatever the hell we thought it was--
and not just you, but--

169
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,516
I'm sorry, Shane.

170
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,187
Please believe me.
I am so sorry.

171
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,291
Take him out to Senoia--
hour there, hour back,

172
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,793
give or take.
We may lose the light,

173
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,463
but we'll be halfway
home by then.

174
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,382
This little pain in the ass
will be a distant memory.

175
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,426
Good riddance.

176
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,095
Carol's putting together
some provisions for him,

177
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,348
enough to last
a few days.

178
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,604
That thing you did last night--

179
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,108
Ain't no reason you should
do all the heavy lifting.

180
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,239
So are you good with all this?

181
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,699
I don't see you and I
trading haymakers

182
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,078
on the side of the road.
Nobody'd win that fight.

183
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,749
I'm gonna take a piss.

184
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,672
Hey, man,
you seen Carl lately?

185
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,423
He's inside
with his mother.

186
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,467
Look, he came to me.

187
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,428
Okay, I wasn't supposed
to say anything,

188
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,347
but he was out
in the swamps yesterday

189
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,517
and he came across a walker
stuck in the mud.

190
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,686
He got scared, ran off.

191
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,105
The same walker
that killed Dale?

192
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,315
That's the one.

193
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,861
- I'll have Lori talk to him.
- Look, I think--

194
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,030
I think he wants
to talk to his father.

195
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,449
Well, I need this Randall thing
done already.

196
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,536
Man, that needs
to wait, okay?

197
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,250
It's my call.

198
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,795
How about
I ride out with Daryl?

199
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,381
Be good for us to spend
a little time together.

200
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,383
Nah, I need you here.

201
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,636
Don't think
I'll handle it right, huh?

202
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,930
- Didn't say that.
- What did you say?

203
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,435
You know, your son--

204
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,979
he gave me this.

205
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,814
You should get that
back to Daryl, huh?

206
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,150
Freeing that prisoner...

207
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,236
more important to you
than Carl.

208
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,501
Andrea. Hey, did you try
pumping the gas pedal?

209
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,378
I think it's been
parked too long.

210
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,921
You gotta tap it
three times...

211
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,632
And give her a twist.
I know, I know.

212
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,386
Let me see.

213
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,736
Uh, Dale told me

214
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,113
that in these old vehicles

215
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,157
the points get corroded.

216
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,285
Screwdriver?

217
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,413
Flathead.

218
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,353
Could you
hand me a file?

219
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,706
I let him down.

220
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,959
He was proud of you.

221
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,378
Maybe not in that moment,

222
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,797
but overall.

223
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,507
Oh, that's easy
for you to say.

224
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,509
You had his back.

225
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,928
I have my share
of regrets,

226
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,639
but I think that he knew

227
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,058
how much
we cared for him.

228
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,902
That might do it.

229
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,537
Glenn.

230
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,182
I bet it'll work.

231
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,472
Mom said you'd be here.

232
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,351
Told her I would stand lookout.

233
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,479
I got tired of helping
around the house.

234
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,860
Take it.

235
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,951
What happened to Dale
had nothing to do with you.

236
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,830
He died, Dad.

237
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,916
Yeah.

238
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,335
Yeah.

239
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,631
Feels like there's a lot
of that going around.

240
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,595
That's why I need you.

241
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,307
No more kid stuff.

242
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,477
I wish you could have
the childhood I had,

243
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,521
but that's not
gonna happen.

244
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,859
People are gonna die.

245
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:00,073
I'm gonna die. Mom.

246
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,452
There's no way you can
ever be ready for it.

247
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,164
I try to be, but I can't.

248
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,418
The best we can do now
is avoid it as long as we can,

249
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,712
keep one step ahead.

250
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,468
I wish I had
something better to say,

251
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,888
something--
something more profound.

252
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,560
My father was
good like that.

253
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,276
But I'm tired, son.

254
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,030
Please take it.

255
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,320
Only got
so many arrows.

256
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,406
Is that Dale's gun?

257
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,742
Yeah.

258
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,245
Wish I knew where
the hell mine is.

259
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,832
- Ready?
- Yeah.

260
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,209
- I'll get the package.
- Thanks.

261
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,800
Yo, Randy.

262
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,137
Governor called.
You're off the hook.

263
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,275
Oh, hell no.

264
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,991
Shh! Go that way.

265
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,746
Go on, go on.

266
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,711
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Now, look.

267
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,255
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Hey, hey, come on. Come on.

268
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,925
I get it. I'm the last face you probably
want to see, huh?

269
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,469
Listen, I'm gonna take you
up out of here, okay?

270
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,930
I'm gonna get this off
of you so you can breathe,

271
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,807
but I want you
to keep quiet.

272
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,643
You listen good.
Do you hear me? Okay.

273
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,311
Don't do nothing stupid.

274
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,979
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

275
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,856
Hey, hey, keep it quiet.

276
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,820
Now your group--
you know where they're at?

277
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,822
- No, I don't. I really--
- Okay.

278
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,491
Get your little ass up here.
Now I'm the only shot

279
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,827
of you getting out of these
woods alive. You hear me?

280
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,454
Now you start talking, boy.
Where are they at?

281
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,999
We had a camp
set up off the highway.

282
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,001
About five miles from here.

283
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,004
- Okay. Okay.
- Who knows if they're still there?

284
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,049
Okay. So you're gonna
take me to 'em?

285
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,177
Why?

286
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,346
Because, man, I--
I'm just--

287
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,265
I'm done
with this group, man.

288
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,433
They're doomed and I want
no part of it.

289
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,688
- That's all.
- So you're not gonna kill me?

290
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,482
Come on, man.
If I was, you'd be dead.

291
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,776
Come on.

292
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,862
Hey, you ain't
gotta be so rough.

293
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,406
We're on the same side now.

294
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,284
You're gonna like it with us.

295
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,369
Gets a little crazy
sometimes,

296
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,538
but it's
a tough bunch of guys.

297
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,415
You'll fit in good.

298
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,626
Less talking,
more walking.

299
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:07,714
Look, I run my mouth
when I get nervous.

300
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,508
I can't help it.

301
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,635
I got a lot
going on, you know?

302
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,387
It ain't all about you.

303
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,723
I ain't saying it's about me.

304
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,683
Just trying to--

305
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,945
- What's wrong?
- Randall's missing.

306
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,447
Missing? How?

307
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,616
How long's he been gone?

308
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,451
It's hard to say.

309
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,203
The cuffs are
still hooked.

310
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,122
- He must've slipped 'em.
- Is that possible?

311
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,958
It is if you've got
nothing to lose.

312
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,002
The door was secured
from the outside.

313
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,771
Rick! Rick!

314
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,650
- What happened?
- He's armed!

315
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,819
- He's got my gun!
- Are you okay?

316
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,988
I'm fine. Little bastard
just snuck up on me.

317
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,740
- He clocked me in the face.
- All right, Hershel, T-Dog,

318
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,325
get everybody
back in the house.

319
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,577
Glenn, Daryl, come with us.

320
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,664
- T, I'm gonna need that gun.
- Just let him go.

321
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,499
That was the plan, wasn't it,
to just let him go?

322
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,167
The plan was to cut him loose
far away from here,

323
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,961
not on our front step
with a gun.

324
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,338
Don't go out there.
Y'all know what can happen.

325
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,756
Get everybody back
in the house.

326
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,301
Lock all the doors
and stay put!

327
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,012
- Let's go, back in the house.
- Okay.

328
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,642
I saw him head up through the trees
that way before I blacked out.

329
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,436
I'm not sure how long.

330
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,979
He couldn't
have gotten far.

331
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,856
He's hobbled,
exhausted.

332
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,941
- And armed.
- So are we.

333
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,360
- Can you track him?
- No, I don't see nothing.

334
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,863
Hey, look, there ain't no use
in tracking him, okay?

335
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,781
He went that way.
We just need to pair up.

336
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,533
We spread out, we just chase
him down. That's it.

337
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,869
The kid weighs
a buck-25 soaking wet.

338
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,787
You trying to tell us
he got the jump on you?

339
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,040
I'd say a rock pretty much
evens those odds, wouldn't you?

340
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,375
All right, knock it off. You and Glenn
start heading up the right flank.

341
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,044
Me and Shane'll
take the left.

342
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,713
Remember, Randall's not
the only threat out there.

343
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,673
Keep an eye out
for each other.

344
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,962
Looks like
it's busted pretty bad.

345
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,800
It's fine, man.

346
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,761
Don't worry about me.

347
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,334
This is pointless.
Give me a light.

348
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,264
Come on.

349
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,600
We're just back to square one.

350
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,853
If you're gonna do a thing,
you might as well do it right.

351
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,335
There's two sets
of tracks right here.

352
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,171
Shane must've followed him
a lot longer than he said.

353
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,094
There's fresh blood
on this tree.

354
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,476
There's more tracks.

355
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,645
Looks like they're
walking in tandem.

356
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,149
Sorry.

357
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,571
Yeah, there was
a little dust up right here.

358
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,659
- What do you mean?
- I mean, something went down.

359
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,702
This is getting weird.

360
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,623
Had a little trouble.

361
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,234
Nice.

362
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,546
Does this way feel right?

363
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,549
As right as any.

364
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,847
- Snatched your gun, huh?
- Yeah.

365
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,224
It's my favorite piece, too.

366
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,976
Gonna wish he'd--

367
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:02,229
wish he'd killed me
when I find his sorry ass.

368
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,360
Go on.

369
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,913
Got his neck broke.

370
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,384
He's got no bites.

371
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,594
Yeah, none you can see.

372
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,265
No, I'm telling you
he died from this.

373
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,894
How's that possible?

374
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,256
You say he got you with a rock?

375
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,675
That's what I said.

376
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,930
Inside the shed?

377
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:27,106
'Cause that door was shut
when T-Dog rolled up.

378
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,611
I saw that, too.

379
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,158
Must've slipped through
the rafters in the roof.

380
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,810
So this is where
you plan to do it?

381
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,816
It's a good place as any.

382
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,903
At least have the balls
to call this what it is--

383
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,741
murder.

384
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,164
You really believe if you walk
back onto that farm alone--

385
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,833
- no me, no Randall--
- I want you to hush up.

386
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,961
You really believe they're gonna buy
whatever bullshit story you cook up?

387
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,339
That's just it.
It ain't no story.

388
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,176
I saw that prisoner
shoot you down.

389
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,844
I ran after him.

390
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,680
I snapped his neck.

391
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,517
It ain't gonna be easy,

392
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,727
but Lori and Carl--
they'll get over you.

393
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,564
They done it before.

394
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,526
They just gonna have to.

395
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,989
Why?

396
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,408
Why now?

397
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,995
I thought we worked
this all out.

398
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,914
We tried to kill each other, man.

399
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,416
What you think?
We was just gonna forget about it?

400
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,418
We gonna ride off
into the sunset together?

401
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,879
You're gonna kill me
in cold blood?

402
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,715
Screw my wife?

403
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,509
Have my children--
my children--

404
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,803
call you Daddy?
Is that what you want?

405
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,390
That life won't
be worth a damn.

406
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,392
I know you.

407
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,229
You won't be able
to live with this.

408
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,317
What you know about
what I can live with?

409
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,572
You got no idea what I can live with,
what I live with!

410
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,241
You wanna talk about
what I can do, Rick?

411
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,743
How about what
you can do? Here I am.

412
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,913
Come on, man.
Raise your gun.

413
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,209
- No. No, I will not.
- What happened, Rick?

414
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,044
I thought you weren't
the good guy anymore.

415
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,296
Ain't that what you said?

416
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,798
Even right here, right now,
you ain't gonna fight for 'em?

417
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,050
I'm a better father
than you, Rick.

418
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,595
I'm better for Lori
than you, man.

419
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,097
It's 'cause I'm a better man
than you, Rick.

420
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,891
'Cause I can be here
and I'll fight for it.

421
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,519
But you come back here and you
just destroy everything!

422
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,692
You got a broken woman.

423
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,778
You got a weak boy.

424
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,198
You ain't got the first clue
in how to fix it.

425
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,786
Raise your gun.

426
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,289
You're gonna have
to kill an unarmed man.

427
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,962
Watch my hand.

428
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,715
Nice and easy.

429
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,811
Easy does it.

430
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,819
Now listen to me, Shane.

431
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,491
There is still
a way back from this.

432
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,910
Nothing has
happened here.

433
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,330
We're gonna
lay down our guns

434
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,167
and we're gonna walk
back to the farm

435
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,253
together.

436
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,676
Back to Lori.

437
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,512
Back to Carl.

438
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,103
Put this all behind us.

439
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,906
Shh.

440
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,375
Damn you for making me
do this, Shane.

441
00:38:56,543 --> 00:39:00,546
This was you, not me!
You did this to us!

442
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:04,383
This was you, not me!
Not me!

443
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,139
Not me!

444
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,011
Son of...

445
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,854
Dad?

446
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,911
Carl.

447
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,502
You know...

448
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,672
you should be
back home with Mom.

449
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,857
Just-- just put the--

450
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,733
put the gun down.

451
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,198
It's not what it seems.
Please.

452
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,059
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
