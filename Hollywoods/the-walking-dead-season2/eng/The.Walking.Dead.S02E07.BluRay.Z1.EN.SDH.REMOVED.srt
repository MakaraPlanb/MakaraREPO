1
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,486
Hey.

2
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,488
Where'd you go?

3
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,532
I'm here.

4
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,654
Um, guys.

5
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,118
So...

6
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,582
the barn is full
of walkers.

7
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,668
You cannot tell me
you're all right with this.

8
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,254
No, I'm not, but we're guests here.
This isn't our land.

9
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,465
- God, this is our lives!
- Lower your voice.

10
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,467
We can't just sweep
this under the rug.

11
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,636
It ain't right. Not remotely.

12
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,639
We've either
got to go in there,

13
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,058
we've got to make things right
or we've just got to go.

14
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,101
Now we have been talking about
Fort Benning for a long time.

15
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,686
- We can't go.
- Why, Rick? Why?

16
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,730
Because my daughter
is still out there.

17
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,774
Okay.

18
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,152
Okay, I think it's time
that we all start to just

19
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,154
consider the other possibility.

20
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,656
Shane, we're not leaving
Sophia behind.

21
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:37,990
I'm close
to finding this girl.

22
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,784
I just found her damn
doll two days ago.

23
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,495
You found her doll, Daryl.
That's what you did. You found a doll.

24
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,330
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

25
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,165
I'm just saying
what needs to be said.

26
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,875
You get a good lead,
it's in the first 48 hours.

27
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,293
Shane, stop.

28
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,671
Let me tell you something else, man.
If she was alive out there

29
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,257
and saw you coming
all methed out with your buck knife

30
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,593
and geek ears around your neck,
she would run in the other direction.

31
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,554
- Shut your mouth!
- Wait!

32
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,721
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

33
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,849
What are you doing?
Don't come at me, man!

34
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,059
- Calm down!
- Shane!

35
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,104
- Back off!
- Keep your hands off me.

36
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,315
Now just let me talk to Hershel.
Let me figure it out.

37
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,025
- What are you gonna figure out?!
- Enough!

38
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,819
If we're gonna stay,
if we're gonna clear this barn,

39
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,363
I have to talk him into it.
This is his land.

40
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,157
Hershel sees those things
in there as people--

41
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,743
sick people--

42
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,913
his wife, his stepson.

43
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,040
- You knew?
- Yesterday I talked to Hershel.

44
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,625
And you waited the night?

45
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,544
I thought we could survive
one more night.

46
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,045
We did.

47
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,798
I was waiting till this
morning to say something.

48
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,092
- But Glenn wanted to be the one.
- The man is crazy, Rick,

49
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,760
if Hershel thinks those
things are alive or no.

50
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,567
Maggie.

51
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,862
Hey, Maggie,
just talk to me.

52
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,830
Hey.

53
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,707
Maggie.

54
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,669
Give me your hat.

55
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,630
You said talk to you,
I'm talking to you. Give me your hat.

56
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,684
Why would you waste
an egg like that?

57
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,020
I think it was rotten.

58
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,828
Does Shane think
Sophia's dead?

59
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,251
Shane's just scared.

60
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,129
- Of the walkers in the barn?
- Yeah.

61
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,719
Mom,

62
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,805
I'm not leaving
until we find Sophia.

63
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,685
And I don't want to go
even after that.

64
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,148
Well, we're not
leaving, Carl.

65
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,359
Now finish those problems.

66
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,449
I just think she--

67
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,910
she's gonna like it here.

68
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,246
This place,
it could be a home.

69
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,985
- You can't.
- I'm fine.

70
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,321
Hershel said
you need to heal.

71
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,824
Yeah, I don't care.

72
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,034
Well, I do.

73
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,621
Rick's going out later
to follow the trail.

74
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,958
Yeah, well, I ain't gonna
sit around and do nothing.

75
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,294
No, you're gonna go out there
and get yourself hurt even worse.

76
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,925
We don't know if we're
gonna find her, Daryl.

77
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,137
We don't.

78
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,227
I don't.

79
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,900
What?

80
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,113
Can't lose you, too.

81
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,172
- Are you all right?
- Just leave me be.

82
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,134
Stupid bitch.

83
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,187
Andrea's looking for you.

84
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,522
Thank you, Glenn.

85
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,733
Any chance you got
an extra hat?

86
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,903
Nope.

87
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,157
Thanks.

88
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,163
Going off with Rick
to look for Sophia.

89
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,210
I thought he was
talking with Hershel.

90
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,711
He is.
We're gonna go after.

91
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,379
I'm headed to the barn
in the meantime.

92
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,673
Shane wants a watch duty
down there.

93
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,217
Does Rick?

94
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,552
Why wouldn't he?

95
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,348
Are you only
getting yours?

96
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,895
I don't know what's going
on with you and him.

97
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,730
- Him?
- Shane.

98
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,066
- Dale.
- It's not my business.

99
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,818
All that matters to me
is that you--

100
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,446
you may not
really know him.

101
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,367
We don't need
to do this.

102
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,494
- You and I are finally--
- It's important.

103
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,162
I get it.
You don't like him.

104
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,040
- It isn't that.
- Then what is it?

105
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,254
Is that how you want to be?

106
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,922
Like him?

107
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,927
He's not a victim.

108
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,432
You don't know him.

109
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,730
Dale, I need you to stop.

110
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,275
You spend so much time

111
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,776
watching me,
looking out for me.

112
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,446
You want to beat me up
anytime I show any concern.

113
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,950
Go ahead.
I'm done.

114
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,244
I'm not beating
you up, Dale.

115
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,955
I'm okay, really.
Things are...

116
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,542
different.

117
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,505
You got your gun.

118
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,884
Okay.

119
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,981
- You okay?
- Yeah.

120
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,987
You mind running
and getting me some water?

121
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,406
I just--

122
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,325
I need a second.

123
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,369
You'll keep watch?

124
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,791
Dale?

125
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,669
Yeah, sure.

126
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,317
Come on in.

127
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,585
A little light reading
for lunch?

128
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,088
Been working
so hard lately

129
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,548
I get my studying
where I can.

130
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,885
You know we can help
you out with your work.

131
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,304
It's my field to tend.

132
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,395
We found the barn.

133
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,606
Leave it be.

134
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,566
Well, I'd like
to talk about it,

135
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,569
but either way-- your barn,
your farm, your say.

136
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,614
I don't want to talk about the barn.
I don't want to debate.

137
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,699
Not a debate,
a discussion.

138
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,214
I need you and your group
gone by the end of the week.

139
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,179
I talked to Dale.

140
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,516
You and I have
our differences

141
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,476
with the way we look
at the walkers.

142
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,272
Those people,

143
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,608
they may be dead,
they may be alive.

144
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,569
But my people, us,

145
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,946
we are alive right now,

146
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,073
right here,
right in front of you.

147
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,617
You send us out there
and that could change.

148
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,661
I've given you safe harbor.

149
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,622
My conscience is clear.

150
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,335
This farm--

151
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,671
this farm is special.

152
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,592
You've been shielded from what's
been going on out there.

153
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,136
Dale said you saw everything
happen on the news.

154
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,055
Well, it's been--
it's been a long time

155
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,100
since the cameras
stopped rolling.

156
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,353
The first time
I saw a walker

157
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,898
it was just half a body
snapping at me from the ground.

158
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,150
My inclination
wasn't to kill it.

159
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,612
But what the world is
out there isn't what you saw on TV.

160
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,948
It is much much worse
and it changes you.

161
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,326
Either into one of them

162
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,870
or something a lot less
than the person you were.

163
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,665
Please do not--
do not send us out there again.

164
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,846
My wife's pregnant.

165
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,477
That's either a gift here

166
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,521
or a death sentence
out there.

167
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,984
If we were to stay
we could help you

168
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,111
with the work,
with securing this place.

169
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,613
We can survive together.

170
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,199
Rick, I'm telling you we can't.

171
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,618
- You think about what you're doing.
- I've thought about it.

172
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,203
- Think about it.
- I've thought about it.

173
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,872
Think about it again.
We can't go out there.

174
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,881
What's it gonna be, man?

175
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,175
Which way does
this thing go?

176
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,636
I don't know yet.

177
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,597
Well, what did he say?

178
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,600
- We're negotiating.
- You're nego--

179
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,394
Clock's ticking, Rick.

180
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,229
No, it isn't, Shane.

181
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,981
That barn--
the barn is secure.

182
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,983
We didn't even know
about it till this morning.

183
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,110
We didn't.
Well, we know about it now.

184
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,155
Right? We know there's over
a dozen walkers in there.

185
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,782
We know that it's about
a stone's throw

186
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,951
from our camp, Rick--
where we sleep.

187
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,580
So look, if we're not gonna go in there
and clear it out then we just got to go.

188
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,624
We're not gonna clear it
out and we're not gonna go.

189
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,958
We at least
need our guns.

190
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,711
We can't have them,
not here.

191
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,047
Why do you want to stay here
when it's not safe?

192
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,299
We can make it safe.

193
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,259
- How we gonna do that?
- We will, okay?

194
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,802
- How we gonna make it safe?
- We will, okay?

195
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,388
- No, man, it's not okay.
- Shane, Lori's pregnant.

196
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,481
We need to stay.

197
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,317
We need our guns.

198
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,653
No, I can work this out.

199
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,451
- You good?
- Yeah.

200
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,205
Lori's having a baby, man.

201
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,291
Congratulations.

202
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,004
Thank you.

203
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,736
Hi, honey.

204
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,290
Carl doesn't need
any more of my help.

205
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,001
So that's it?

206
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,381
Rick was trying
to make his case.

207
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,135
It'll be hard.
They'll have to be careful.

208
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,011
But he was being dramatic.

209
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,014
They're a strong group.
They've done well on their own.

210
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,059
They're just gonna have to go
out and find their own farm.

211
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,812
There's plenty of them
now to chose from.

212
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,523
There aren't.
Every one of them nearby

213
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,900
is burned out
or full of walkers.

214
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,278
Walkers?

215
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,658
So we just keep these
people here forever?

216
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,787
How are they
my responsibility?

217
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,750
"A new command I give to you:

218
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,754
love one another
as I have loved you."

219
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,424
That's what you
told me, right?

220
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,890
I was mad about Mom.

221
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,768
Mad about you
marrying Annette.

222
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,062
I was 14 years old
and I was awful,

223
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,773
to you more
than anybody.

224
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,651
All I wanted to do
was smoke and shoplift.

225
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,281
"Love one another."
That's what you told me.

226
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,575
Maggie.

227
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,287
That was different.

228
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,206
No.

229
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,124
You're different.

230
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,418
I am.

231
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,463
But we're not.

232
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,508
I love you.

233
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,927
That's part of this.

234
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,264
Is this about you
and the Asian boy?

235
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,517
- Do you want me to--
- No.

236
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,523
His name is Glenn.

237
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,108
He saved my life yesterday
when one of the people

238
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,985
you think is sick
tried to kill me.

239
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,905
How's that for dramatic?

240
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,743
Things aren't what
you think they are.

241
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,703
They aren't.

242
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,664
Don't do this.

243
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,376
Okay? It's not about
me and Glenn.

244
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,461
It's not about
me and you.

245
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,505
It's about you.

246
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,633
It's about who you are,
who you're gonna be.

247
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,845
Hershel!

248
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,015
It happened again.

249
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,313
...also shows she could
be moving this way south.

250
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,232
If Sophia kept
in that direction,

251
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,110
she might have gotten out
of the forest and into the farmland.

252
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,153
So we take 74
up to Ivy Road,

253
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,740
then push down south on foot through
the forest till we hit Christopher,

254
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,994
go east a couple of miles
and then double back.

255
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,829
- Rick.
- Hershel.

256
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,999
We just have our guns out because
we're gonna go look for Sophia.

257
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,960
Before you do that, I could use
your help with something.

258
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,336
Count me in.

259
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,964
Thank you,
but I just need Rick.

260
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,012
I'll be down at the barn
keeping watch until you're ready.

261
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,467
- I thought he was dead.
- Shane, I don't--

262
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,261
Then when he came back,
right then, right there,

263
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,221
you see I wished he was.

264
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,808
Not-- not because you
wouldn't be mine,

265
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,770
but because I knew that sooner
or later he would be dead.

266
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,860
See Rick,

267
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,571
he ain't built
for this world,

268
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,615
not for what it is now.

269
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,409
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

270
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,578
Lori, how many times
has he saved your life?

271
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,040
I want to know how many times.
Because by my count,

272
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,168
I've saved your life on four different
occasions. And that's Carl's, too.

273
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,212
So I just want to ask you, how many
times has Rick saved your life?

274
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,798
That night at the camp. That night
at the camp after the fish fry.

275
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,967
No, no, no.
See, no.

276
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,219
That was me, too.

277
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,764
You see, Rick,
he showed up late

278
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,809
because he went on
a suicide mission over nothing.

279
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,145
Yeah, he joined in,

280
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,272
but, see, we wouldn't
have been in that situation

281
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,316
if he hadn't left
because he felt

282
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,485
that he needed to leave
to save a drug dealer.

283
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,863
And so we lost Amy
and we lost Jim.

284
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,032
We lost--

285
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,208
Rick told me.

286
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,085
Told you what?

287
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,254
And I know the reason
why you didn't

288
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,089
is because
you know it's mine.

289
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,550
- It's Rick's.
- Okay.

290
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,427
You know, we carried on
quite a bit

291
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,680
before Rick got back, Lori.
It's mine. You know it is.

292
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,890
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

293
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,185
I'm sorry.
Shane, I'm sorry.

294
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,563
But even if it's yours,
it's not gonna be yours.

295
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:40,442
It's never gonna be yours and there's
nothing you can do to change that.

296
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,200
I don't need to.

297
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,099
Hey, Shane.

298
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,185
Can I talk to you
for a second?

299
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,401
You okay?

300
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,278
Yeah.

301
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,197
I know you think
that Sophia's dead

302
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,532
and that we should stop
looking for her.

303
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,535
- But that's bullshit.
- Hey, man, watch your mouth.

304
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,413
We're gonna stay here
until we find her.

305
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,584
You think that's
what we should do?

306
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,795
It's what I know
we should do.

307
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,091
Then we stay.

308
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,135
That means we got to do

309
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,763
whatever we got to do
to make that happen.

310
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,265
- Hmm?
- Like help out with chores?

311
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,142
Mmm.

312
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,234
Like help out
with the chores.

313
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,444
Carl.

314
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,946
Come here for a minute.

315
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,990
Why don't you go
see what your mom wants?

316
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,327
Hmm?
Go on.

317
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,665
Hey, Carl.

318
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,251
Don't let me hear
you talk like that again.

319
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,223
S'up?

320
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,499
Son of a bitch.

321
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,923
You see where he went?

322
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,843
- Who?
- Don't even try to shit me, okay?

323
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,511
- What?
- Dale, Glenn.

324
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,430
Did you see
where Dale went?

325
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,932
Yeah, he asked me to run
and get him some water.

326
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,517
He said he'd cover
me on watch.

327
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,644
And he was gone
when you got back, huh?

328
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,438
Yeah.

329
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,648
- You think he's okay?
- Oh, he's fine.

330
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,233
Why'd he bail then?

331
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,319
So you wouldn't tell me
which way he went.

332
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,529
I don't get it.

333
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,032
No, man, you don't.

334
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,582
The silt on the bottom
is like glue.

335
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,250
You just sink in.

336
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,921
That's Lou Bush.

337
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,505
You knew him?

338
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,257
Lou as in Louise.

339
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,718
She has a farm
up the road.

340
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,762
Sweet corn mostly.

341
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,181
Worked at Hatlin's Bar
on weekends.

342
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,601
The man, I don't know him,

343
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,394
but the coveralls,

344
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,730
I've been
to where he worked.

345
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,941
How many
have you killed?

346
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,401
Too many to count.

347
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,739
Can you stop?

348
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,704
There are people out there

349
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,415
who haven't been
in their right minds,

350
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,960
people who I believe
can be restored.

351
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,088
You're not talking
about the walkers, are you?

352
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:33,549
It doesn't matter if you see them
as human beings anymore.

353
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,386
But if you and your people
are going to stay here,

354
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,097
that's how you're gonna
have to treat them.

355
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,475
My farm, my barn, my say.

356
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,487
- You see it?
- See what?

357
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,290
I'll find her.

358
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,260
Hell, I'm sorry about
what happened this morning.

359
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,221
You wanted
to look for her.

360
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,976
Why?

361
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,146
This whole time
I've just wanted to ask you.

362
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,650
'Cause I think
she's still out there.

363
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:41,826
Truth is,
what else I got to do?

364
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,138
We'll find her.

365
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,349
We will.

366
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,851
I see it.

367
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:18,279
Otis said if you get them halfway
out they'll do the rest of the work.

368
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,198
How many times
did he do this?

369
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,868
If one wandered onto the property,
Otis would get them into the barn.

370
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,620
Now we have to.

371
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,497
What happens when
the barn gets full?

372
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,083
- Jeez!
- Get the pole!

373
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,794
Jimmy. Jimmy.
You got it.

374
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,213
Easy. Easy, Rick.
Lead him.

375
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,714
Jimmy will spot for us.

376
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,133
Lead him
lead him, Rick.

377
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,636
- You're the carrot, not the stick.
- What?

378
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,679
You heard me,
just lead him.

379
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,681
He'll come to you.

380
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,059
You told me
he handled them easily.

381
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,561
This is easy?

382
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,730
It's easier
than some things.

383
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,149
All right, it's through this way.

384
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,040
Maggie.

385
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,670
Hey.

386
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,718
Maggie.

387
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,096
Maggie.

388
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,014
Maggie, just stop
for a second.

389
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,934
You talked about it.
You told Dale, fine.

390
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,937
I asked you.
I told you.

391
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,814
I just asked you
for one thing. One thing.

392
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,149
I couldn't do it.

393
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,276
My dad's gonna kick you guys
out now. He told me.

394
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,236
No, Rick's gonna work
something out with your dad.

395
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,655
- Okay? I had to tell them.
- You did not.

396
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,366
No, I did.

397
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,201
I wanted to.

398
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,956
You see, I forgot.

399
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,041
Okay? I forgot or I stopped
thinking about it

400
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,252
or maybe I didn't want
to think about it.

401
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,088
I let them lower me into
that well like it was fun,

402
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,048
like I was playing "Portal."

403
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,342
- It's a video game.
- Of course it's a video game.

404
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,429
And then the pharmacy happened
yesterday and I realized something.

405
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,556
I forgot that
they're dangerous.

406
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,683
I don't care if they're sick
people or dead people,

407
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,268
they're dangerous.

408
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,228
And then I realized
something else.

409
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,148
That I don't want you
in danger ever.

410
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,942
So I hate to blow
your dad's big secret,

411
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,237
but I'm sick of secrets.
Secrets get you killed.

412
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,865
And I'd rather have you
pissed off at me and alive

413
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,575
than liking me and dead.

414
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,494
So that's why I told them.

415
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,707
Hey, walker bait.

416
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,918
Don't call me that.

417
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,131
Okay, Glenn.

418
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,750
Man, this is a good hiding place.

419
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,628
We ain't been in
the swamps much, huh?

420
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,384
Imagine if you applied
your tracking skills

421
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,010
to finding Sophia.

422
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,721
How about

423
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,225
you just give me
that bag, huh?

424
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,561
I'm not gonna do that.

425
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,479
Yeah, you are, Dale.

426
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,856
Unless, well,

427
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,485
you do have that rifle
over your shoulder.

428
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,571
You gonna shoot me
like you did Otis?

429
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,155
Tell another story?

430
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,783
No, man.

431
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,078
Hell, when you
really look at it

432
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,289
in the cold light of day,

433
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,709
you're pretty much
dead already.

434
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:05,339
Just give me the guns.
Do it now.

435
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,675
You think this
is gonna keep us safe?

436
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,219
Mm-hmm.
I know it is.

437
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,598
Rick is trying
to get Hershel--

438
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,934
Dale, shut up. Just shut up
and give me the guns.

439
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,741
Am I gonna
have to shoot you?

440
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,410
Do I have to kill you?
Is that what it's gonna take?

441
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,999
Eh.

442
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,012
Yeah.

443
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,681
That's what it's gonna take.

444
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,360
This is where
you belong, Shane.

445
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,861
How's that, Dale?

446
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,989
This world,
what it is now,

447
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,242
this is where
you belong.

448
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,289
And I may not have what
it takes to last for long,

449
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,208
but that's okay.

450
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,211
'Cause at least I can say

451
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:28,506
when the world goes to shit

452
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,800
I didn't let it
take me down with it.

453
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,681
Fair enough.

454
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,192
You look like you should be in line
for the Early Bird Special.

455
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,946
Go get your cap.
I'll wash it for you, okay?

456
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,409
- Do you know what's going on?
- Where is everyone?

457
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,661
- You haven't seen Rick?
- He went off with Hershel.

458
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,454
We were supposed to leave
a couple hours ago.

459
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,623
Yeah, you were.
What the hell?

460
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,042
Rick told us
he was going out.

461
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,795
Damn it. Isn't anybody taking
this seriously?

462
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,214
We got us a damn trail.

463
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,508
Oh, here we go.

464
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,099
- What's all this?
- You with me, man?

465
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,893
- Yeah.
- Time to grow up.

466
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,063
- You already got yours?
- Yeah. Where's Dale?

467
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,023
- He's on his way.
- Thought we couldn't carry.

468
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,567
We can and we have to.

469
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,319
Look, it was one thing sitting
around here picking daisies

470
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,155
when we thought this place
was supposed to be safe.

471
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,656
But now we know it ain't.

472
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,118
How about you, man?
You gonna protect yours?

473
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,496
That's it.
Can you shoot?

474
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,915
Can you stop? You do this,
you hand out these guns,

475
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,500
my dad will make you
leave tonight.

476
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,252
- We have to stay, Shane.
- What is this?

477
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,837
We ain't going
anywhere, okay?

478
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,798
Now look, Hershel,
he's just gotta understand.

479
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,592
Okay? He--
well, he's gonna have to.

480
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,428
Now we need to find Sophia.
Am I right?

481
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,139
Huh? Now I want
you to take this.

482
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,849
You take it, Carl, and you
keep your mother safe.

483
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,100
You do whatever it takes.
You know how.

484
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,393
Go on,
take the gun and do it.

485
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,479
Rick said no guns.
This is not your call.

486
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,147
This is not
your decision to make.

487
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:11,734
Oh, shit.

488
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,111
This way. Come on.

489
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,824
What is that?

490
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,659
- What is that?
- Shane!

491
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,832
To me. Over this way.

492
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,587
What the hell
are you doing?

493
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,381
- Shane, just back off.
- Why do your people have guns?

494
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,550
Are you kidding me?
You see?

495
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,135
You see what
they're holding onto?

496
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,679
- I see who I'm holding onto.
- No, man, you don't.

497
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,431
Shane, just let us do this
and then we can talk.

498
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,308
What you want
to talk about, Rick?

499
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,520
These things ain't sick.
They're not people.

500
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,147
They're dead. Ain't got to feel
nothing for them

501
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,107
'cause all they do,
they kill!

502
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,651
These things right here,

503
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,486
they're the things
that killed Amy.

504
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,072
They killed Otis.
They're gonna kill all of us.

505
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,907
Shane, shut up!

506
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,034
Hey, Hershel, man,
let me ask you something.

507
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,619
Could a living
breathing person,

508
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,246
could they walk away
from this?

509
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,374
No!

510
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,709
- Stop it!
- That's three rounds in the chest.

511
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,711
Could someone who's alive,
could they just take that?!

512
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,047
Why is it still coming?

513
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,882
That's its heart,
its lungs.

514
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,343
Why is it still coming?

515
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,304
- Shane, enough.
- Yeah, you're right, man.

516
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,014
That is enough.

517
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,951
Enough risking our lives
for a little girl who's gone!

518
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,953
Enough living next to a barn

519
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,997
full of things that
are trying to kill us.

520
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,876
Enough.
Rick, it ain't like it was before!

521
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,046
Now if y'all want to live,
if you want to survive,

522
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,715
you got to fight for it!

523
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:01,135
I'm talking about
fighting right here, right now.

524
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:04,013
Take the snare pole.

525
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,056
Hershel, take the snare pole.

526
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,809
Hershel, listen to me,
man, please.

527
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,103
Take it now.
Hershel!

528
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,521
Take it!

529
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,487
No, Shane.
Do not do this, brother. Wait!

530
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,576
- Don't do it!
- Rick!

531
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,952
Please!

532
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,874
Come on.

533
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,126
This is not the way!

534
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,378
Please!

535
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,755
Get behind me.

536
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,673
Come on.

537
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,742
- Maggie.
- Okay.

538
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,802
Stay back!

539
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,185
Stop!

540
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,819
Oh, God.

541
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,655
Sophia? Sophia!

542
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,992
Oh, Sophia.

543
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,995
Sophia.

544
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,866
Sophia.

545
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,462
Don't watch.
