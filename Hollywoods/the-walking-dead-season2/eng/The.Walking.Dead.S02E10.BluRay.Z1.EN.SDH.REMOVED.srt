1
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,365
I thought we were
going further.

2
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,034
We are.

3
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,245
18 miles out.

4
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,708
So why are we stopping?

5
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,088
I wanted to talk.

6
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,550
Been waiting a week
till we were gonna do this.

7
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,263
- I just want to talk.
- We don't need to.

8
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,182
We do.

9
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,018
No, man, we don't.

10
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,521
We're doing this.
I get it.

11
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,773
He was passed out when
y'all brought him back,

12
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,400
doesn't know
where the farm is.

13
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,402
That isn't what I need
to talk to you about.

14
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,411
I heard

15
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,080
what really happened
at the school.

16
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,252
Was it to survive?

17
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,923
Yeah.

18
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,801
One of us wasn't
gonna make it out.

19
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,012
It had to be him.

20
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,184
One shot to the leg,
Carl lives.

21
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,688
Reality is...

22
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,776
he had no business
being here.

23
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,032
Or there.
Whatever.

24
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,788
You don't think
I would've done it?

25
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,415
No, man, I know
you wouldn't have.

26
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,543
You don't think I can keep
Lori or Carl safe?

27
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,379
I didn't say that.

28
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,214
Or my baby?

29
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,425
Is it gonna
have to be me, too?

30
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,178
Rick, you can't just be the good
guy and expect to live.

31
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,056
Okay? Not anymore.

32
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,391
I'm not
the good guy anymore.

33
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,312
To save Carl's life,

34
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,522
I would've done anything.
Anything.

35
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,192
Now Lori says
you're dangerous,

36
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,653
but you're not
gonna be dangerous.

37
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,988
Not to us, not to me,

38
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,907
not anymore.

39
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,620
How about
you look at me?

40
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,293
You and Lori--

41
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,840
I get what happened.

42
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,261
When I figured it out--
and I figured it out pretty quickly--

43
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,597
I wanted
to break your jaw,

44
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,684
let you choke
on your teeth.

45
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,520
But I didn't.

46
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,565
That wasn't weakness.

47
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,193
It took everything.

48
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,741
That is my wife.
That is my son.

49
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,785
That is my unborn child.

50
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,497
I will stay alive
to keep them alive.

51
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,298
You don't love her.

52
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,344
You think you do,
but you don't.

53
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,184
Now the only way
you and me keep on...

54
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,648
is that you accept everything
I just said right here, right now,

55
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,526
and we move forward
with that understanding.

56
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,169
When it started
it was just--

57
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,089
it was a couple
of weird stories on the news.

58
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,011
Then it was so quick.

59
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,682
Everything--
it just happened.

60
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,436
Two weeks later
I'm in the hospital

61
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,605
and there were soldiers shooting
people in the halls.

62
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,690
They were shooting people,
man, not walkers.

63
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,901
Then the walkers
came through.

64
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,529
You know,
I tried to get you out.

65
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,657
I tried, but we weren't
gonna make it.

66
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,160
Man, there was no way
and I knew it.

67
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,370
But I couldn't live with it.

68
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,499
I couldn't live, knowing--

69
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,210
But I had to.

70
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,838
I didn't keep Lori
and Carl alive, man.

71
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,548
They kept me alive.

72
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,264
I want you to know that
I didn't look at her before that.

73
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,434
Brother, if I could
take it all back, I would.

74
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,107
I wanna check the ropes.

75
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,340
It's all good.

76
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,182
Rick say anything to you about Glenn
when they got back from town?

77
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,768
Just that it had
gotten pretty bad.

78
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,063
He's not the same.

79
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,731
Says he froze.

80
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,734
Blames me.
Says I got inside his head.

81
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,779
He came back--
that's what matters.

82
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,408
Men have to do certain things--
you know that--

83
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,244
and they're either gonna
blame the little woman

84
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,454
as the reason they do 'em
or the reason they don't.

85
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,540
I'll tell you something--
what happens out there

86
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,209
happens out there.
And we--

87
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,130
we're just trying to keep it together
till they get back.

88
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,716
- Things were good. Maybe I--
- Glenn's a big boy.

89
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,885
He makes his own choices.
I mean, do you--

90
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,053
do you have anything
to apologize for?

91
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,685
Tell him to man up
and pull himself together.

92
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,438
Just don't say, "Man up."

93
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,815
It never goes well.

94
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,445
Let me just
get this to Beth.

95
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,739
You go on. I got it.

96
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,292
We've gotta start
using our knives more.

97
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,669
If there's one walker,

98
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,296
we use our knives.

99
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,715
We keep things quiet.
We save ammunition.

100
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,134
Yeah.

101
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,595
We need dry goods
ahead of the winter--

102
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,348
warm clothes, fuel.

103
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,017
Maybe we get a break.

104
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,645
You gotta think
the cold affects them.

105
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,857
If it doesn't kill 'em,
it's gotta slow 'em down.

106
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,318
The second week
of January last year,

107
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,403
we got all that
snow and ice.

108
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,324
My cousin got stuck
on 85 for 24 hours.

109
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,576
Sitting in his car
with a birthday cake

110
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,578
for his girlfriend
at Georgia Tech.

111
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,622
He just sat
and ate birthday cake

112
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,334
and listened to the "Lord
of the Rings" book on tape.

113
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,545
We get lucky, we get the same
winter as last year.

114
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,841
By December,
it's a different world.

115
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,468
Safer.

116
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,973
Maybe we find some snowmobiles
to make runs.

117
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,811
Yeah, sounds good.

118
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,072
Knock, knock.

119
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,957
How about this--
you, uh--

120
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,209
you eat up all your food,
we'll get you up and out of here

121
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,711
and go take a walk.
What do you say?

122
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,088
It'll do good
to be outside.

123
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,676
You're pregnant?

124
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,680
How could you do that?

125
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,768
Uh, I don't really
have a choice.

126
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,524
You think it'll make
a difference?

127
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,235
Of course it will.

128
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,446
You eat something.

129
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,877
It's more than 18.

130
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,589
Yeah, I'm looking
for a place.

131
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,549
A place for what?

132
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,303
Give him a fair shake.
A shot.

133
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,411
There.

134
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,038
This'll do.

135
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,084
We'll leave the boy here,
scavenge some supplies.

136
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,712
Psst.
Over there.

137
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,055
Wait.

138
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,933
Like I said.

139
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,206
Gun's quick, easy,

140
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,917
but other ways to do this.

141
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,672
One more. Your turn.

142
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,193
Hey, Rick.

143
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,322
I don't see any bites.

144
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,284
Gotta be scratches then--

145
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,077
this one's hand,

146
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,621
other one's cheek.

147
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:20,127
They had walkers here--
burned bodies down the hill.

148
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,423
I guess it gotta
be scratches then, huh?

149
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,622
Haven't eaten a thing, huh?

150
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,832
You're gonna--

151
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,132
Hey.

152
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,886
I know how hard it is.

153
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,599
I tried for days to reach my mom
and get her on the phone.

154
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,601
I can only assume--

155
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,227
It's just so pointless.

156
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,313
Oh.

157
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,357
You have Maggie

158
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,652
and your father
and Patricia and Jimmy.

159
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,238
And you've gotta
stay strong for them.

160
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,953
I wish I could promise you
it would be all right in the end.

161
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,330
I can't,

162
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,084
but we can make now
all right.

163
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,795
And we have to.

164
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,467
Thank you.

165
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,142
I'll be right back.
We'll go take that walk.

166
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,244
Beth?

167
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,501
You give it to me,
sweetheart.

168
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,920
You don't
wanna do this.

169
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,902
Andrea, have you seen
Maggie or Hershel?

170
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,739
I haven't seen Hershel, but I saw
Maggie and Glenn walk by

171
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,657
- maybe 20 minutes ago.
- Could you find her for me?

172
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,701
- I've gotta get back to the house.
- Of course.

173
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,844
What the hell is this?

174
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,641
Oh, come on,
don't be stupid.

175
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,852
I owe you guys.

176
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,480
I can help protect
what you've got.

177
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,608
Why would you save my life just
to kill me by leaving me here?

178
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,153
One guy-- one guy
can't make it alone.

179
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,322
That's why I was
with those dudes-- I was alone.

180
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,452
Don't be stupid!
I'm not like them!

181
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,747
I'm just some guy.

182
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:47,125
I used to watch football
and screw around on the internet.

183
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,794
I lived with my mom!

184
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,463
I lost her
like you lost people.

185
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,174
I went to school with Maggie,
for God's sake!

186
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,099
I went to church.

187
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,185
I rode the bench
on varsity baseball.

188
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,355
- You went to school with Maggie?
- Did you go to school with Maggie?

189
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,441
- Answer the question!
- Did you go to school with Maggie?

190
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,485
I-- it--
she didn't know me.

191
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,821
Didn't even know
I existed.

192
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,616
I mean, I knew her.

193
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,827
I knew who her dad was.

194
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,538
There is no way

195
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,122
I would ever do anything

196
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,500
- to hurt her or her family.
- Jesus.

197
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,293
Or you.
Or your people.

198
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,672
I'm not like the guys
I was with!

199
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,715
He knows where the farm is, Rick.

200
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,968
Where we are.
He knows.

201
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,846
Say he finds his way
back to his people...

202
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,813
Shane, no!

203
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,108
Not now.
Just not now.

204
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,197
Well, when, Rick? When?

205
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,203
When I've had a chance
to think about it.

206
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,915
- Don't let him kill me. Please, don't.
- Shut up!

207
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,837
We're going back.
It's a man's life.

208
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,423
I need a night
to think it through.

209
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,425
You're gonna bring
this piece of garbage--

210
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,052
this piece
of garbage who--

211
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,554
he shot at you, Rick.

212
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,055
He ran with men
who tried to kill you.

213
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,099
You gonna bring him back
to where Lori sleeps?

214
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,436
- To where Carl sleeps?
- He'll be locked up in the barn.

215
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,564
- Unless you bust it open.
- Oh, don't start that shit.

216
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,566
- I'm taking the night.
- Man, you take that--

217
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,277
you think on it, Rick.
Keep struggling with it.

218
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,447
It ain't hard, man. The right choice
is the one that keeps us alive.

219
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,616
It's always the same with you.

220
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,201
It's like the first moment--
it's whenever you're put to the test.

221
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,288
Stop acting like you know the way
ahead, like you know the rules.

222
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,124
There are no rules, man.
We're lost.

223
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,959
No, no, no, man.
I know exactly where I am.

224
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,211
- You don't know shit anymore.
- I don't think you can do it, Rick.

225
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,131
- It's my call, man.
- I don't think you can keep them safe.

226
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,976
Ah!

227
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,645
Damn!

228
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,730
Oh, God!

229
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,035
No!

230
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,290
Get off me, man.

231
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,239
You're not doing this!

232
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,618
You don't get to make
these calls anymore.

233
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,413
I won't let you.

234
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,314
Are you crazy?
What if Dad finds out?

235
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,817
What's he gonna do?
Kill me for committing suicide?

236
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,946
Stop being such a brat.

237
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,614
He'd die.

238
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,366
So would I.

239
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,035
This isn't
just about you.

240
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,496
We all lost Mom.

241
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,915
May lose each other,
and I couldn't stand that.

242
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,917
So you give up?

243
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:16,556
Come on, bitch.
Let's see what you got. Come on.

244
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,205
Where's Hershel?

245
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,457
Maggie doesn't want him
to find out yet.

246
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,419
It's a family affair.
We'll let them work it out.

247
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,296
That's working it out?

248
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,465
When Beth stops fighting,
that's when it's time to worry.

249
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,595
You are being so selfish!

250
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,764
This could've
been handled better.

251
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,558
How so?

252
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,936
You shouldn't have
taken the knife away.

253
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,981
- Excuse me?
- You were wrong.

254
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,443
Like Dale taking my gun.
That wasn't your decision.

255
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,947
She has to choose
to live on her own.

256
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,990
She has to find
her own reasons.

257
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,450
Want me to tie
a noose for her?

258
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,452
If she's serious,
she'll figure out a way.

259
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,788
Doesn't mean
I can't stop her

260
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,331
or let her know
that I care.

261
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,791
That has nothing
to do with it, Lori.

262
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,126
She only has so many choices
in front of her,

263
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,629
and she believes
the best one is suicide.

264
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,839
- That's not an option.
- Of course it is.

265
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,592
She doesn't need to be yelled at
or treated like a child.

266
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,011
She needs
a loaded gun, right?

267
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,805
You'll understand if
I don't send you in there.

268
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,473
I came through it.

269
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,351
And became such a productive
member of the group.

270
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,478
- Let Maggie handle this her way.
- I contribute.

271
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,563
I help keep
this place safe.

272
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,485
The men can handle this on their own.
They don't need your help.

273
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,448
I'm sorry.
What would you have me do?

274
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,867
Oh, there's plenty
of work to go around.

275
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,953
Are you serious?

276
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,497
Everything falls apart, you're in
my face over skipping laundry?

277
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,542
Puts a burden
on the rest of us,

278
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,712
on me and Carol
and Patricia and Maggie.

279
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,463
Cooking and cleaning
and caring for Beth.

280
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,382
And you--

281
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,342
you don't care about
anyone but yourself.

282
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,635
You sit up on that RV,

283
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,679
working on your
tan with a shotgun in your lap.

284
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,350
No, I am on watch
against walkers.

285
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,228
That is what matters, not fresh
mint leaves in the lemonade.

286
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,230
And we are
providing stability.

287
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,858
We are trying to create
a life worth living.

288
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,985
Are you kidding me?

289
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,864
Look, I went after Rick.
I took down two walkers.

290
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,700
After crashing Maggie's car.
Ever apologize for that?

291
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,494
Crashing her--

292
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,080
- You're insane.
- No, you are.

293
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,999
And you're the one
that's self-centered,

294
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,084
the way you take it
all for granted.

295
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,587
My husband is out there

296
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,756
for the hundredth time.

297
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,674
My son was shot.

298
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,926
Don't you dare tell me
that I take this for granted.

299
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,553
You don't get it,
do you?

300
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,556
Your husband came back
from the dead, your son, too.

301
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,558
And now you've
got a baby on the way.

302
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,894
The rest of us have
piled up our losses--

303
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,438
me, Carol, Beth-- but you just
keep on keeping on.

304
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,814
We have all suffered.

305
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,232
Playing house,
acting like the queen bee,

306
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,401
laying down rules
for everybody but yourself.

307
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,779
You know what?
Go ahead.

308
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,239
Go in there and tell
that little girl

309
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,909
that everything's gonna
be okay, just like it is for you.

310
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,120
She'll get a husband,
a son, baby,

311
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,914
boyfriend.

312
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,130
She just has to look
on the bright side.

313
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,501
Mom would be ashamed

314
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,712
to learn she raised
such a coward.

315
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,924
- What about Dad, Beth?
- He's clueless.

316
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,844
- He had us waiting for a cure.
- He knows he was wrong.

317
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,472
When has Dad ever
admitted he was wrong?

318
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,308
He's just telling Rick's group
what they want to hear.

319
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,310
And Jimmy?

320
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,480
We went out for three months
and now I'm married to him?

321
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,192
And me?

322
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,194
You could do that to me?

323
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,571
I can't take
another funeral.

324
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,199
You can't avoid it.

325
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,704
What are we waiting for?

326
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,835
- We should both do it.
- What?

327
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,838
At the same time.
Help each other.

328
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,215
- No.
- It's hard to do it.

329
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,550
- No one wants to, but...
- No.

330
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:45,718
- we could do it so it's easy.
- Stop talking like that.

331
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:49,138
Our choice,
and then it would be over.

332
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,892
Or we'll be forced to do it when
the farm and this house is overrun.

333
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,145
- No one can protect us.
- That's not true.

334
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,356
Who, Glenn?

335
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,692
I heard what happened.

336
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,071
Rick will save his family,

337
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,281
the others, too.

338
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,451
We're alone.

339
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,329
You, me, Patricia,

340
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:17,083
with only Dad and Jimmy
against a whole world of those things.

341
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,586
I don't wanna be gutted.

342
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,093
I wanna go...

343
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,265
in this bed tonight...

344
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,476
with you beside me.

345
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,439
Please.

346
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,266
Okay.

347
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,943
You want some of that?

348
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,825
Oh, shit.

349
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,003
Hey.

350
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,630
You can't sit on top of her.

351
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,674
- I can't leave her by herself.
- You're gonna have to.

352
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,678
You're exhausted.

353
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,014
Go get some air.
I'll sit with her.

354
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,849
Go ahead.

355
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,809
Wash up,
get something to eat.

356
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,521
- I got it.
- Okay.

357
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,359
Okay.

358
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,527
- Thanks.
- Okay.

359
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,551
Aren't you gonna
say something?

360
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,942
Is this what you want?

361
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,783
The pain doesn't go away.

362
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,578
You just make room for it.

363
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,181
- Stop!
- Holy shit.

364
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,769
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

365
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,271
What did you
expect me to do?

366
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,022
Please,
just let me go, man.

367
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,941
That's what
you came here for.

368
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:32,069
- I'm not gonna tell anyone anything.
- Shut up.

369
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,697
You wanna stay here?

370
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,782
Help the guy that just tried
to bash your head in?

371
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,369
There's 10 roamers there.

372
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,455
You think you can
take that on?

373
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,958
They don't see us.
We can get out of here.

374
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,756
Fine. Fine!

375
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,299
But let me have a gun.

376
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,800
I'll help you.

377
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,927
I'll show you.

378
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,138
Let's go.

379
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,265
- What?
- He did this.

380
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,517
- We're going.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

381
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,484
Rick. Rick.

382
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,652
Come back, man.

383
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,123
Beth?

384
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,504
Beth? Beth?

385
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,091
- Maggie?
- She's in there. I heard glass.

386
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,427
Beth, you all right?

387
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,012
Don't do this, Beth.
Don't do this.

388
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,931
Open up, please.

389
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,308
God, I left her
with Andrea.

390
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,311
- Where's the key?
- I don't know.

391
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,439
Beth, honey,
please open the door.

392
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,150
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad, Beth.

393
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,693
Maggie.

394
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,695
Hang on.

395
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,036
I'm sorry.

396
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,500
Okay. It's okay.

397
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,636
Stay there.

398
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,496
All right.

399
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,582
Come on, that's it.

400
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:53,752
Yeah, you like that?

401
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,438
Shane!

402
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,816
Shane!

403
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,693
Go for the back door!

404
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,528
Come on!

405
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,702
Come on, get in!

406
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,788
Go, man, go!
Come on!

407
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,137
Whoo! Yeah!
Hell yeah!

408
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,181
You see that?
You see what we did?

409
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,558
Just keep driving.

410
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,074
- Where were you?
- I heard. Is she all right?

411
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,368
She would be if you had stayed
with her. Where were you?

412
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,244
- How bad is she?
- It wasn't deep.

413
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,249
She wants to live.
She made her decision.

414
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,251
- She tried to kill herself.
- No, she didn't.

415
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,504
My father is stitching
her wrist right now.

416
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,673
She'll live.

417
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,758
Stay away from her.

418
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,593
From both of us.

419
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,971
Don't you dare step foot
inside this house again.

420
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,652
I'm not gonna say
she was right,

421
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,779
but Beth has
made her choice.

422
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,031
She want to live
and now she knows it.

423
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,618
And sometimes you have to
cross the line.

424
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,468
If you want to kill me,

425
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,428
you're gonna have to do
better than a wrench.

426
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,935
Probably gonna
have to kill that boy.

427
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:01,148
But I am gonna
think about it a night.

428
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,026
It can't be that easy,
killing someone,

429
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,403
killing anyone.

430
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,364
You know that.

431
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,249
That is my wife.

432
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,128
That is my son.

433
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,798
That is my child.

434
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,638
If you're gonna be with us,

435
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,599
you gotta follow my lead,
you gotta trust me.

436
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,241
It's time
for you to come back.
