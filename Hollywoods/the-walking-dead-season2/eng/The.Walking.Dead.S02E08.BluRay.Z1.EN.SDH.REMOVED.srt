1
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,151
Don't look. Don't look.

2
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,641
Shh, shh.
Wait, wait.

3
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,865
Ma.

4
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,289
Come on!

5
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,958
Pull her away!
Pull her away!

6
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,334
We've been out. We've been combing
these woods looking for her

7
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,503
and she was
in there all along?

8
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,088
- You knew.
- Leave us alone.

9
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,924
- Hey, Shane, just stop, man.
- Get your hands off me.

10
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,760
You knew
and you kept it from us.

11
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,720
- I didn't know.
- That's bullshit.

12
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,555
- I think y'all knew.
- We didn't know!

13
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,683
- Why was she there?!
- Your--

14
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,645
Otis put those people
in the barn.

15
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,982
Maybe he found her and put her
in there before he was killed.

16
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,359
You expect me
to believe that?

17
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,069
- I look like an idiot?
- Shane, hey, hey, hey.

18
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,030
- I don't care what you believe!
- Everybody just calm down.

19
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,824
- Get him off my land!
- Please. No.

20
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,868
- Let me tell you something.
- Hey. Don't touch him!

21
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,372
Haven't you done enough?

22
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,422
I mean it-- off my land.

23
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,561
What are you doing?

24
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,729
Hey, what are you doing?

25
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,274
Daryl almost died
looking for her, Rick.

26
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,442
Any one of us could have.
I'm gonna tell you right now--

27
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,070
that son of a bitch,
he knew.

28
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,905
He didn't know.
He's not like that.

29
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,949
- He opened his home to us.
- Put us all in danger.

30
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,909
He kept a barn full of walkers.

31
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,244
So you just start
an insurrection,

32
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,996
hand out guns
and massacre his family?

33
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,081
- His family's dead, Rick.
- Well, he doesn't believe that.

34
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,291
He thinks you just
murdered them in cold blood.

35
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,667
No, man, I don't care
what he thinks.

36
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,253
I was handling it, brother.
I was handling it and you just--

37
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,006
You had us out in those woods
looking for a little girl

38
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,924
that every single one
of us knew was dead!

39
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,384
That's what you did.

40
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,636
Rick, you're just
as delusional as that guy.

41
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,431
You were handling it, huh?

42
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,705
I have to ask you--

43
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,166
did you know
she was in the barn?

44
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,434
You know, maybe in some
weird way this is for the best.

45
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,770
At least we know
and now we can move on.

46
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,233
- Move on?
- Yeah, it's just like...

47
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,779
it meant so much to everyone--
finding her, you know?

48
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,283
- And then--
- So now you'll just move on?

49
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,076
If we can.

50
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,955
I mean, we've lost others.

51
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,085
This is-- this is Sophia.

52
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,257
The whole group--

53
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,885
this one was different.

54
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,265
So what happens now?

55
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,100
We bury her...

56
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,105
with your stepmom
and your stepbrother.

57
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,276
And then?

58
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,286
I don't know.

59
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,832
- I thought I'd find her.
- We all did.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,126
I mean me.

61
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,587
That I'd be the one.

62
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,673
Like maybe she was
hiding somewhere

63
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,175
in a cave or a tree.

64
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,135
She'd be safe

65
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,514
and I'd find her
and bring her back.

66
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,853
He did the right thing...

67
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,690
shooting her like that.

68
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,318
I would've done it, too.

69
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,950
Dale?

70
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,828
Yeah?

71
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,162
Could you take Carl
up to the house?

72
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,706
I want you to rest.

73
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,500
Okay.

74
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,801
Hey, you dropped that.

75
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,188
You want us
to start burying?

76
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,733
We need a service.
Carol would want that.

77
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,694
Yeah, we all want that.

78
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,910
Let's-- let's dig
a grave for Sophia,

79
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,746
and Annette and Shawn...

80
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,083
over by those trees.

81
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,211
And we'll need a truck
to move the bodies.

82
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,672
- I'll get the keys.
- No, no.

83
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,716
I got the truck.

84
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,719
And the others?
That's a lot of digging.

85
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,889
We bury the ones we love
and and burn the rest.

86
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,684
Let's get to work.

87
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,775
What did Hershel say?

88
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,280
He wants us off the farm.

89
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,283
Or Shane at least.

90
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,287
That's not a surprise.

91
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,789
We're lucky
someone wasn't killed.

92
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,416
And all that gunfire--

93
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,585
more walkers
could've heard it.

94
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,925
Baby, what is it?

95
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,971
She was there all the time.

96
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,432
And you did
everything you could.

97
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,643
Yeah, I know.
I always do, don't I?

98
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,104
Went after her,
protected her,

99
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,774
killed those walkers,
but she still got bit.

100
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,776
And Carl still got shot.

101
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,112
People counting on me
and I had 'em chasing

102
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,490
- a ghost in a forest.
- Hey.

103
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,489
Do you got something
to say, Dale?

104
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,451
Well, go ahead, man.

105
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,329
Mr. Moral Authority, huh?

106
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:26,208
You the--
the voice of reason.

107
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,337
Let me ask you something, man.
What do you do?

108
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,172
What do you do to keep
this camp safe, huh?

109
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,216
What do you do?
What, you fix up an RV?

110
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,343
You babysit some guns?

111
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,512
Man, you pointed one
at my chest, right?

112
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,974
But you just-- you couldn't pull
that trigger, could you?

113
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,853
If I was such a danger,
if I was such a threat,

114
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,354
what did you do
to stop me, huh?

115
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,899
I smashed that barn open.
I saved Carl.

116
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,652
That's me. That ain't you.
That ain't Rick. That's me.

117
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,905
Tell you what, Dale--

118
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,576
next time I need
a radiator hose...

119
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,203
I'll give you a call, man.

120
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,612
That's it.

121
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,920
They're ready.

122
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,758
Come on.

123
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,928
Why?

124
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,931
'Cause that's your little girl.

125
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,645
That's not my little girl.

126
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,315
That's some other thing.

127
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,948
My Sophia was alone
in the woods.

128
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,285
All this time, I thought--

129
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,667
She didn't cry
herself to sleep.

130
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,461
She didn't go hungry.

131
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,632
She didn't try
to find her way back.

132
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,138
Sophia died
a long time ago.

133
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,477
- A few more trips.
- We got lucky.

134
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,604
If that barn had any more,
we could've been overrun.

135
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,775
Good thing Shane did
what he did when he did.

136
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,986
You can't tell me
this was right.

137
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,613
It wasn't.
It'll cost us with Hershel.

138
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,407
He's grieving.
He'll come around,

139
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,784
see we had no choice.

140
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,786
Look, I shot, too.
This wasn't all Shane.

141
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,454
Look, I got no qualms about it.

142
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,624
Walkers in my backyard?
Mm-mmm.

143
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,792
I'm not saying
that we shouldn't have

144
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,087
taken care of the problem,
but creating a panic to--

145
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,089
There's no point arguing
about it. It's done.

146
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,466
There's nothing
we can do about it.

147
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,137
Better get moving.

148
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,955
Hey! Hey!

149
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,012
All right!

150
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,107
So if your group leaves,
you wouldn't stay?

151
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,777
I-- I hadn't really
thought about it.

152
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,530
I mean, I--
I didn't know that--

153
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,159
do-- do you think
this is really the time

154
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,577
to discuss this, I mean?

155
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:39,206
Well, I'm not really feeling like
there's a lot of time for anything.

156
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,375
No, no, there-- there is.

157
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,714
There is.
I'd want--

158
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,717
Oh, my God.

159
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,178
Sweetie, can you hear me?

160
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,891
- What's wrong with her?
- She might be in shock.

161
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,686
- Where's Hershel?
- We can't find him anywhere.

162
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,899
Hey, kiddo.

163
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,530
- Your stepmother's things?
- He was so sure she'd recover.

164
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,533
They'd just pick up
where they left off.

165
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,038
Looks like he found
an old friend.

166
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,919
That belonged to my grandfather,
gave it to Dad when he died.

167
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,755
I didn't take Hershel
for a drinker.

168
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,091
No, he gave it up
on the day I was born.

169
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,260
He didn't even
allow liquor in the house.

170
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,931
- What's the bar in town?
- Hatlin's.

171
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,933
He practically lived there
in his drinking days.

172
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,685
Betting that's where
I'll find him.

173
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,437
Yeah, I've seen the place.
I'll take you.

174
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,938
- All right, I'll get the truck.
- Okay.

175
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,733
- No.
- It's an easy run.

176
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,443
- Like the pharmacy?
- Hey, Maggie?

177
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,737
I'll bring him back.

178
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,072
Maggie, that was different.

179
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,782
Rick?

180
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,577
You want to have a conversation
about this before you leave?

181
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,454
So you're seriously
gonna go after this guy

182
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,788
with everything
that's going on, huh?

183
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,623
He's right.
He's right.

184
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,542
This is not the time
to head off, not today.

185
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,878
- You don't always have to--
- I'm not arguing.

186
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,546
It's the least I can do
for Hershel after we--

187
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,090
What?
After we what?

188
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,304
Carl said he would've
shot Sophia himself.

189
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,765
That's your son.
He's getting cold.

190
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,641
He's growing up
in a world with--

191
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,438
he's growing up in a world where
he needs a father like you--

192
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,315
around, alive,

193
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,317
not running off, solving everybody
else's problems.

194
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,486
It's not just his problem
I'm trying to solve.

195
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,989
We need Hershel
for the baby.

196
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,827
I'm going after him.

197
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,028
- You ready?
- Yeah.

198
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,041
Hey.

199
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,544
Carol?

200
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,171
Carol.

201
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,340
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

202
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,094
Hey, are you all right?

203
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,014
- Keep away.
- Come here.

204
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,443
I want you to know
that I'm real sorry for your girl.

205
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,779
Thank you.

206
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,537
When I opened that barn
I had no idea.

207
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,832
If I did...

208
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,962
Everybody thinks
that I'm a...

209
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,594
I was just trying
to keep everybody safe.

210
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,645
I had no idea
she was in there.

211
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,490
This place is going to hell.

212
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:24,824
Yeah, I'm trying hard
to prevent that.

213
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,660
You won't be able to.

214
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,954
No, there are people
in this group

215
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,748
who think that what
Shane did was justified.

216
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,333
I know you two
can't stand each other,

217
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,335
but he did something
that needed to be done.

218
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,170
He's dangerous.

219
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,964
Yeah, he's a hothead.

220
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,007
No, Lori,
he's dangerous.

221
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,511
I think he killed Otis.

222
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,263
Otis was killed
by walkers.

223
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,684
He knew how
to handle walkers.

224
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,019
Otis was the one who was
putting them in the barn.

225
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,188
You need to be really clear
with me right now.

226
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:58,108
- What are you saying?
- I believe that--

227
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,528
that Shane sacrificed Otis.

228
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,155
I can't prove it,
but I-I-I--

229
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,865
I think that he--
I think that he shot him

230
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,952
and left him for bait,
so that he could get away.

231
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,206
Shane may be a hothead,
but he's not a murderer.

232
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,500
And why would he kill somebody
who's trying to help?

233
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,377
I don't know.
Maybe he was pinned down.

234
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,880
He said-- he said it.
He all but threw it in my face.

235
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,343
I'm telling you--
I knew guys like him,

236
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,846
and sooner or later...

237
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,725
he's gonna kill
somebody else.

238
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,588
Maggie said she loves me.

239
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,965
Mm-hmm.

240
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,593
She doesn't mean it.

241
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:10,013
I mean, she can't.
I mean, why...

242
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:14,768
She's upset or confused.
She's probably feeling, like--

243
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,687
I think she's smart enough
to know what she's feeling.

244
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,356
No. No.

245
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,610
You know, she wants
to be in love,

246
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:27,822
so she needs something
to, like, hold onto.

247
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,158
Glenn, it's pretty obvious
to everyone Maggie loves you,

248
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,452
and not just because you're one
of the last men standing.

249
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,079
So what's the problem?

250
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,790
I didn't say it back.

251
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,167
Huh.

252
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,628
I've never had a woman
say that to me before

253
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,380
except my mom, of course,

254
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,549
and my sisters.

255
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,802
But with Maggie,
it's different.

256
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,762
I mean, we barely
know each other.

257
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,890
What does she really
know about me? Nothing.

258
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,267
We're practically strangers.

259
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,144
But I didn't know
what to do with it.

260
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,271
I just stood there like a jerk.

261
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,649
Hey. Hey, this is
a good thing.

262
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,110
Something we don't get
enough of these days.

263
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,653
Enjoy it.

264
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,988
And when we get back,
return the favor.

265
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,698
It's not like
she's going anywhere.

266
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,296
Rick?

267
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,006
I know about Lori,

268
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,342
her being pregnant.

269
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,178
- I got her those pills.
- I figured.

270
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,645
Hey, I'm sorry
I kept it from you.

271
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,440
Don't be. You did what
you thought was right.

272
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,820
It just so happens it wasn't.

273
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,511
Her heart's racing.
She's burning up.

274
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,055
We need Hershel.
He'll know what to do.

275
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,730
- Would you look in on Carl for me?
- Of course.

276
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,697
Moving to the suburbs?

277
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,535
Listen, Beth's in some kind
of catatonic shock.

278
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,705
- We need Hershel.
- Yeah. So what?

279
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,916
So I need you to run
into town real quick

280
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,084
and bring him
and Rick back.

281
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,087
Daryl?

282
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,217
Your bitch went
window-shopping.

283
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,677
You want him?
Fetch him yourself.

284
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,721
I got better things to do.

285
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,389
What's the matter with you?

286
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,350
Why would you be so selfish?

287
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,769
Selfish?
Listen to me, Olive Oyl.

288
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,730
I was out there looking
for that little girl every single day.

289
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,024
I took a bullet
and an arrow in the process.

290
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,610
Don't you tell me about
me getting my hands dirty!

291
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,113
You want those two idiots?
Have a nice ride.

292
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm done looking for people.

293
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,388
Hershel.

294
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,891
Who's with you?

295
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,601
Glenn.

296
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,981
Maggie send him?

297
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,108
He volunteered.

298
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,235
He's good like that.

299
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:07,125
- How many have you had?
- Not enough.

300
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,630
Let's finish this up
back at home.

301
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,008
Beth collapsed,

302
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,136
is in some sort of state.

303
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,472
Must be in shock.
I think you are, too.

304
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,183
Maggie's with her?

305
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,186
Yeah, but Beth needs you.

306
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,314
What could I do?

307
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,649
She needs her mother.

308
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,860
Or rather to mourn...

309
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,363
like she should've
done weeks ago.

310
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,325
I robbed her of that.

311
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,369
I see that now.

312
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,832
You thought
there was a cure.

313
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,210
Can't blame yourself
for holding out for hope.

314
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,172
Hope?

315
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,053
When I first saw you
running across my field

316
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,180
with your boy
in your arms,

317
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,309
I had little hope
he would survive.

318
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,186
But he did.

319
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,605
He did.

320
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,732
Even though
we lost Otis.

321
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,194
Your man Shane
made it back

322
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,404
and we saved your boy.

323
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,910
That was the miracle
that proved to me miracles do exist.

324
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,539
Only it was a sham,

325
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,333
a bait and switch.

326
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,047
I was a fool, Rick.

327
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,759
And you people saw that.

328
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,725
My daughters deserve
better than that.

329
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,337
So what do we do?
Just wait for him to pass out?

330
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,173
Just go.

331
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,509
Just go!

332
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,095
I promised Maggie
I'd bring you home safe.

333
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:10,516
Like you promised that little girl?

334
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,813
So what's your plan?
Finish that bottle?

335
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,149
Drink yourself to death
and leave your girls alone?

336
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:22,487
Stop telling me how to care
for my family, my farm.

337
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,323
You people are like a plague!

338
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,326
I do the Christian thing,
give you shelter,

339
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,703
and you destroy it all!

340
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,372
The world was already
in bad shape when we met.

341
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,500
And you take
no responsibility!

342
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,376
You're supposed
to be their leader!

343
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,379
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

344
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,384
Yes.

345
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,681
Yes.

346
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,892
Yes, you are.

347
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,569
Come on.

348
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,697
Your girls need you now
more than ever.

349
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,700
I didn't want
to believe you.

350
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,662
You told me
there was no cure,

351
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,248
that these people
were dead, not sick.

352
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,042
I chose not
to believe that.

353
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,920
But when Shane
shot Lou in the chest

354
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,838
and she just kept coming,

355
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,883
that's when I knew
what an ass I'd been,

356
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,887
that Annette had
been dead long ago

357
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,098
and I was feeding
her rotten corpse!

358
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:35,017
That's when I knew
there was no hope.

359
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,731
And when that little girl
came out of the barn,

360
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,526
the look on your face--

361
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,612
I knew you knew it, too.

362
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,449
Right?

363
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,451
There is no hope.

364
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,248
And you know it now,
like I do.

365
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,293
Don't you?

366
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,926
There is no hope
for any of us.

367
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,960
- You ready?
- Yeah.

368
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,922
Man, how many times
we gonna have to do this?

369
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:53,304
Look, I'm done.
I'm not doing this anymore,

370
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,307
cleaning up after you.
You know what the truth is?

371
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,976
Nothing has changed.

372
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:02,146
Death is death.
It's always been there,

373
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,357
whether it's from
a heart attack, cancer,

374
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,984
or a walker.
What's the difference?

375
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,487
You didn't think it was hopeless
before, did you?

376
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,281
Now there are people
back at home trying to hang on.

377
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,826
They need us, even if it's just
to give them a reason to go on,

378
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,953
even if we don't
believe it ourselves.

379
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,333
You know what?
This isn't about

380
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,627
what we believe anymore.

381
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,713
It's about them.

382
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:46,816
Son of a bitch.
They're alive.

383
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,535
I'm Dave.

384
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,829
That scrawny-looking
douche bag there is Tony.

385
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,915
- Eat me, Dave.
- Hey, maybe someday I will.

386
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,751
We met on I-95
coming out of Philly.

387
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,545
Damn shit-show that was.

388
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:11,382
I'm Glenn. It's nice
to meet some new people.

389
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,925
Rick Grimes.

390
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,596
- How about you, pal? Have one?
- I just quit.

391
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,765
You've got a unique sense
of timing, my friend.

392
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,686
His name's Hershel.
He lost people today, a lot of them.

393
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm truly sorry
to hear that.

394
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,277
To better days
and new friends.

395
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,404
And to our dead--

396
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,698
may they be
in a better place.

397
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,412
Ah. Ah.

398
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,209
Not bad, huh?

399
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,255
I got it off a cop.

400
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,925
- I'm a cop.
- This one was already dead.

401
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,556
You fellas are a long way
from Philadelphia.

402
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,391
It feels like we're
a long way from anywhere.

403
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,726
What drove you south?

404
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:04,977
Well, I can tell you
it wasn't the weather.

405
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,646
I must've dropped 30 pounds
in sweat alone down here.

406
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,691
- I wish.
- No, first it was DC.

407
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,693
I heard there might be
some kind of refugee camp,

408
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,821
but the roads were so jammed,
we never even got close.

409
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,699
We decided to get
off the highways, into the sticks,

410
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,951
keep hauling ass.

411
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,413
Every group we came across had a new
rumor about a way out of this thing.

412
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,582
One guy told us there was
a Coast Guard center in the Gulf,

413
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,000
sending ferries
to the islands.

414
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,127
The latest was
a rail yard in Montgomery

415
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,796
running trains to the middle
of the country--

416
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,340
- Kansas, Nebraska.
- Nebraska?

417
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,425
Low population,
lots of guns.

418
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,802
Kinda makes sense.

419
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,970
You ever been to Nebraska, kid?

420
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,598
The reason they call 'em
flyover states.

421
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,981
How about you guys?

422
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,108
Fort Benning, eventually.

423
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:57,112
I hate to piss in your cornflakes,
officer, but...

424
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,407
we ran across a grunt
who was stationed at Benning.

425
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,952
He said the place
was overrun by lamebrains.

426
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,788
Wait, Fort Benning is gone?
Are you for real?

427
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,207
Sadly, I am.

428
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,753
Ugly truth is there is
no way out of this mess.

429
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,840
Just keep going
from one pipe dream to the next,

430
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,883
praying one
of these mindless freaks

431
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,218
doesn't grab ahold
of you when you sleep.

432
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,053
If you sleep.

433
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,556
Yeah, it doesn't look like you guys
are hanging your hats here.

434
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,141
You holed up
somewhere else?

435
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,521
Not really.

436
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,567
Those your cars out front?

437
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,152
Yeah. Why?

438
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,696
We're living in ours.

439
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:42,199
Those look
kinda empty, clean.

440
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,786
- Where's all your gear?
- We're with a larger group.

441
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,706
Out scouting,
thought we could use a drink.

442
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,292
A drink?
Hershel, I thought you quit.

443
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,588
Well, we're thinking
of setting up around here.

444
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,591
- Is it safe?
- It can be.

445
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,678
Although I have killed
a couple of walkers around here.

446
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,513
Walkers?
That what you call them?

447
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,308
- Yeah.
- That's good.

448
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,101
I like that. I like that better
than lamebrains.

449
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,895
More succinct.

450
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,189
- Okay, Tony went to college.
- Two years.

451
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,075
So what-- so what,
you guys set up

452
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,036
on the outskirts
or something?

453
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,080
- That new development?
- Trailer park or something?

454
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,541
A farm?

455
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,589
You on a farm?

456
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,392
Is it safe?
It's gotta be.

457
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,853
- You got food, water?
- You got cooze?

458
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,730
Ain't had a piece
of ass in weeks.

459
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,231
Listen, pardon my friend.

460
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,233
City kids--
they got no tact.

461
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,902
No disrespect.

462
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,989
- So listen, Glenn--
- We've said enough.

463
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,992
Well, hang on a second.
This farm, it sounds pretty sweet.

464
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,495
- Don't it sound sweet, Tony?
- Yeah, real sweet.

465
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,957
How about a little
southern hospitality?

466
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,794
We got some buddies back at camp,
been having a real hard time.

467
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,588
I don't see why you can't make
room for a few more.

468
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,298
We could pool our resources,
our manpower.

469
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,550
Look, I'm sorry.
That's not an option.

470
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,809
Doesn't sound
like it'd be a problem.

471
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,310
I'm sorry. We can't.

472
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,562
We can't take in any more.

473
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,484
You guys are
something else.

474
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,737
I thought-- I thought
we were friends.

475
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,409
We got people
we gotta look out for, too.

476
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,869
We don't know
anything about you.

477
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,329
No, that's true.

478
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,333
You don't know
anything about us.

479
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,629
You don't know what we've had
to go through out there.

480
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,299
The things we've had to do.

481
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,680
I bet you've had to do some
of those same things yourself.

482
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,598
Am I right?

483
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:19,314
'Cause ain't nobody's hands clean
in what's left of this world.

484
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,984
We're all the same.

485
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,320
So come on, let's--

486
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,073
let's take a nice friendly
hayride to this farm

487
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,242
and we'll get
to know each other.

488
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,830
That's not gonna happen.

489
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,749
- Rick--
- This is bullshit.

490
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,584
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

491
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,919
- Don't ever tell me to calm down.
- Whoa.

492
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,255
I'll shoot you three assholes in
the head and take your damn farm!

493
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,216
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Relax.

494
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,635
Take it easy.
Nobody's killing anybody.

495
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,555
Nobody's shooting anybody.
Right, Rick?

496
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,645
Look.

497
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,400
We're just friends
having a drink. That's all.

498
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,363
Now where's
the good stuff, huh?

499
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,658
Good stuff, good stuff,
good stuff. Let's see.

500
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,038
Hey, look at that.

501
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,706
That'll work.

502
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,087
You gotta understand--

503
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,006
we can't stay out there.

504
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,426
You know what it's like.

505
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,720
Yeah, I do.

506
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,389
But the farm is
too crowded as is.

507
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,309
I'm sorry.
You'll have to keep looking.

508
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,520
Keep looking.

509
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,939
Where do you suggest
we do that?

510
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,609
I don't know.

511
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,362
I hear Nebraska's nice.

512
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,116
Nebraska.

513
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,035
This guy.
