1
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,383
I'm going after them.

2
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,051
Don't.
They could be anywhere.

3
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,721
And if Randall comes back,
we're gonna need you here.

4
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,350
- Rick and Shane ain't back?
- No.

5
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,769
- We heard a shot.
- Maybe they found Randall.

6
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,938
- We found him.
- Is he back in the shed?

7
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,565
He's a walker.

8
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,067
Did you find the walker
that bit him?

9
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,194
No, the weird thing is
he wasn't bit.

10
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,739
- His neck was broke.
- So he fought back.

11
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,699
The thing is,
Shane and Randall's tracks

12
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,534
were right
on top of each other.

13
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,328
And Shane ain't
no tracker,

14
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,748
so he didn't come up behind him.
They were together.

15
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,499
Would you please get back
out there and find Rick and Shane

16
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,126
and find out
what on earth is going on?

17
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,794
- You got it.
- Thank you.

18
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,675
You bit, too?

19
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,971
No.

20
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,683
Shane was.

21
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,647
That wasn't Shane.
You know that.

22
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,484
Used to be.

23
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,616
What happened?

24
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,578
You guys attacked?

25
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,706
I mean, I--
I heard a gunshot,

26
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,960
but I didn't see
any walkers nearby.

27
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,341
How did Shane die?

28
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:19,026
Oh, my God. Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

29
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,796
We got to get to the house,
tell the others.

30
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,673
We'll never get through that.

31
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,466
Can't go around.

32
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,011
Carl, stay close. Go!

33
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,435
- Patricia, kill the lights.
- I'll get the guns.

34
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,186
Maybe they'll just pass,
like the herd on the highway.

35
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,354
Should we just go inside?

36
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,398
Not unless there's a tunnel
downstairs I don't know about.

37
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,567
A herd that size will
rip the house down.

38
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,047
- Carl's gone.
- What?

39
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,049
He-- he was upstairs.
I can't find him anymore.

40
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,259
- Maybe he's hiding.
- He's supposed to be upstairs.

41
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,219
- I'm not leaving without my boy.
- We're not.

42
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,846
We're gonna look again.
We're gonna find him.

43
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,264
So many.

44
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,574
Maggie.

45
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,451
You grow up country,
you pick up a thing or two.

46
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,286
They got the numbers.
It's no use.

47
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,330
You can go if you want.

48
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,832
You gonna take 'em all on?

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,252
We have guns.
We have cars.

50
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,296
Kill as many as we can,

51
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,633
then we use the cars to lead
the rest of them off the farm.

52
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:09,136
- Are you serious?
- This is my farm.

53
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,055
I'll die here.

54
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,766
All right. It's as good
a night as any.

55
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,103
All right, here we go.
Get behind me.

56
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,647
Come on.
Hurry.

57
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,234
Oh, shit.
All right. Okay.

58
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,236
Up there. Hurry.

59
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,613
- What about you?
- I'll be right there.

60
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,615
Drop the lighter
when I say.

61
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,119
We'll stop some of them
from reaching the house

62
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,496
and distract the others,
so at least we'll have a chance.

63
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,999
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
You can do this.

64
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,252
Carl...

65
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,795
I love you.

66
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,966
All right, go, go, go.

67
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,138
Hey! Hey!

68
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,515
You want some?!

69
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,476
Come and get it!

70
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,895
Come on!
Come on!

71
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,648
Come on!

72
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,984
Over here!

73
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,653
Come on!
You want some of this?

74
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,199
Carl, now!

75
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,990
- Keep it steady!
- I'm trying!

76
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,534
Damn it.

77
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,164
Shit!

78
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,525
The barn's on fire.

79
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,444
They're headed for it.

80
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,404
Maybe Rick set it
to draw 'em in.

81
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,406
I can't find him anywhere.

82
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,951
- So maybe he snuck outside.
- What do I do?!

83
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,453
He was here.
He must've run off,

84
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,580
maybe looking for Rick
or went after Randall himself.

85
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,624
Maybe he set the fire.

86
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,437
Yo! Must've been Rick or Shane
who started that fire.

87
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,023
Maybe they're trying to get out back.
Why don't you circle around?

88
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,109
- Got it!
- Go!

89
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,618
Hey! Here!

90
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,245
Get in here!

91
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,540
Put it right there!
Come on!

92
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,633
Go on, go on.

93
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,723
Oh, no.
No!

94
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,891
Oh, no!

95
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,602
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

96
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,990
Come on! Now!

97
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,370
All right, go.

98
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,670
This way.

99
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,451
They're all over the place.
There's no corralling them.

100
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,745
We're gonna run out of ammo
before we even make a dent.

101
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,622
We need
a new game plan.

102
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,506
There.
Head for the woods now,

103
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,716
as fast as you can.
Come on.

104
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,648
Come on!

105
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,650
I checked the shed.
I can't find him anywhere.

106
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,611
- He's not in the cellar or the attic.
- Why can't he listen for once?

107
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,823
Okay, okay, if he followed
his daddy, he went that way.

108
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,492
No, you'll lead 'em right to him.
We can't stay here!

109
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,078
- But that's my boy!
- You're gonna have to trust.

110
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,039
If we find him, he's gonna need
his mother. We've got to go.

111
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,669
Get the others.

112
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,338
Carl!

113
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,633
Beth, Patricia, come on.
We've got to go now.

114
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,098
Lori.

115
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,477
- Hershel.
- Come on!

116
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,771
Hershel.
Hershel!

117
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,109
- Hershel, it's time to go!
- Come on! Now!

118
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,530
Hershel!
Hershel!

119
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,493
- Go.
- Come on.

120
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,079
- We gotta go.
- Stay behind me.

121
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,956
Stay behind me.

122
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,042
Come on, girls.
Come on.

123
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,673
No!

124
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,202
Dad! Dad!

125
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,162
- Get in!
- Get Carol.

126
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,497
She ran that way.

127
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,624
Get in!

128
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,465
Look out!

129
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,427
- They got her!
- Andrea!

130
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,970
We've got to go!

131
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,889
Dog, come on!

132
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,029
Where the hell are they going?

133
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,656
Should I follow them?

134
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,366
I'd say yes.

135
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,034
Swing it around.
Swing it around here.

136
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,494
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

137
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,287
Oh, my God.

138
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,874
I can't get through.

139
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,545
- Head out.
- What?

140
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,922
- Get off the farm now.
- Don't say that.

141
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,841
- Maggie, it's lost!
- The others-- we can't leave them.

142
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,059
Get off the farm now!

143
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,655
Come on!

144
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,700
Come on!

145
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,551
Come on!

146
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,511
Where's Lori?
Did you see Lori?

147
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,471
I don't know what happened, Rick.
They just keep coming.

148
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,889
It's like a plague.
They're everywhere.

149
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,057
Lori! Did you see her?

150
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,809
- No!
- We have to go.

151
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,394
Find Mom and the others.

152
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,188
- It's my farm!
- Not anymore!

153
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,567
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

154
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,990
- Come on!
- Hershel!

155
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,908
Come on!

156
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,454
Go.

157
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,917
Rick! Rick, wait!
Wait!

158
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,292
Come on, I ain't got all day!

159
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,507
Go!

160
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,793
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

161
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,378
All right, let's just-- let's just
circle back to the highway.

162
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,048
Did you see my dad?
Did-- did he make it?

163
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,592
- Did you see?
- I couldn't see anything.

164
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,095
And Beth-- I lost Beth.
We've gotta go back there.

165
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,931
We can't go back, okay?
There's nothing to go back to.

166
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,141
But Beth--

167
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,227
I-I-- I think
she was with Lori.

168
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,271
- Did they make it?
- I don't know.

169
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,399
Patricia? Jimmy?

170
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,362
What if they didn't make it?
What if nobody made it?

171
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,947
They made it, okay?

172
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,448
They had to.

173
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,492
All right, let's just

174
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,744
circle around to the highway where
we left supplies for Sophia.

175
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,872
No, the herd came
from that direction.

176
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,879
Just stop.
Stop the car.

177
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,216
Stop the car.

178
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,010
Let me drive.

179
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,195
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

180
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,282
Hey, Maggie, look at me.
Look at me.

181
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,535
Hey, we're alive.
We made it.

182
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,204
Okay?
I'm sure they are, too.

183
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,125
Right?

184
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,795
I love you.

185
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,673
Maggie, I love you.

186
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,968
I should've said it
a long time ago

187
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,053
and it's been true
for a long time.

188
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,686
We're gonna be
all right, okay?

189
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,731
We'll be all right.

190
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,233
Okay. Yeah.

191
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,929
Wait, where's Mom?

192
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,139
You said she'd be here.

193
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,643
We've got to go back for her.

194
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,686
- Carl--
- No. Why are we running?

195
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,146
What are you doing?

196
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,981
It's-- it is Mom.

197
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,317
We need to get her
and not be safe a mile away.

198
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,612
Shh. We need to be quiet,
all right? Please.

199
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,077
Please...

200
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,871
it's Mom.

201
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,001
- Look, Carl, listen--
- No.

202
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,509
Rick.

203
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,557
You've got to get
your boy to safety.

204
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,936
I'll wait here for my girls
and the others.

205
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,563
I know a few places.

206
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,107
We'll meet up
at one of them later.

207
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,317
Where?
Where is safe?

208
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,405
We're not splitting up.

209
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,740
Please,

210
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,867
keep your boy safe.

211
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,786
I'll hide
in one of the cars.

212
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,080
If a walker gets me,
so be it.

213
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,748
I've lost my farm.

214
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,459
I've lost my wife
and maybe my daughters.

215
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,503
You don't know that.

216
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,214
They'll be here.

217
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,384
- And you don't know that.
- You're a man of God.

218
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,386
Have some faith.

219
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,388
I can't profess

220
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,474
to understand God's plan,

221
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:35,395
but Christ promised
the resurrection of the dead.

222
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,941
I just thought
he had something

223
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,819
a little different in mind.

224
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,451
We stick together.

225
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,128
Hey, we've got to turn around.

226
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,047
Straight back
to that herd?

227
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,882
Um, no.

228
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,967
The highway's back there.
That's where they'll be.

229
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,677
Rick will go back
to where we first broke down.

230
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,637
- And Glenn, too.
- We're headed east.

231
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,890
Get to the coast. We should've
done that from the jump.

232
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,851
Look, we've got a shot to get out
of here in one piece.

233
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,978
I've got to find Carl.
He may have escaped with somebody.

234
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,938
I hate to say it,
but they're on their own.

235
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,274
There's no way to even
begin to start looking.

236
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,109
You're wrong.

237
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,236
Look, we can't go back.

238
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,030
I'm sorry.
It's suicide.

239
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,407
All right,
then let me out.

240
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,785
Hey! Whoa!

241
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,914
You turn around,
or you let us out right now.

242
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,375
I should do it, you know.
Hey!

243
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,669
T-Dog.

244
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,715
You're out
of your damn minds.

245
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,694
Okay.
Come, come, come, come.

246
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,834
I don't know how
much longer we can stay here.

247
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,879
I'm not leaving
without Mom.

248
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,423
So we're just
gonna walk away?

249
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,634
Not knowing if my wife,

250
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,137
your girls are still out there?
How do we live with that?

251
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,890
You've only got one
concern now-- just one--

252
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,143
keeping him alive.

253
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,228
Nature may be
throwing us a curveball,

254
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,356
but that law is still true.

255
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,911
Carl.

256
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,833
It's not safe here.

257
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,422
I'm sorry.

258
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,465
We'll--

259
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,554
Oh, thank God!

260
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,483
Where'd you find everyone?

261
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,402
Well, this guys' tail lights
zigzagging all over the road--

262
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,239
figured he had to be Asian,
driving like that.

263
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,241
Good one.

264
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,867
Where's the rest of us?

265
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,828
We're the only ones
who made it so far.

266
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,580
Shane?

267
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,257
Andrea?

268
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,593
- She saved me, then I lost her.
- We saw her go down.

269
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,096
Patricia?

270
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,558
They got her, too.

271
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,936
Took her right from me.
I was--

272
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,273
I was holdin' onto her,
Daddy. She just--

273
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,569
What about Jimmy?
Did you see Jimmy?

274
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,948
He was in the RV.
It got overrun.

275
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,119
You definitely saw Andrea?

276
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,204
There were
walkers everywhere.

277
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,415
Did you see her?

278
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,793
- I'm gonna go back.
- No.

279
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,337
- We can't just leave her.
- We don't even know if she's there.

280
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,964
She isn't there.
She isn't.

281
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,341
She's somewhere else
or she's dead.

282
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,844
- There's no way to find her.
- So we're not even gonna look for her?

283
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,470
We've got to keep moving.

284
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,514
There have been walkers
crawling all over here.

285
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:25,059
- I say head east.
- Stay off the main roads.

286
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,103
The bigger the road,
the more walkers,

287
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:30,565
more assholes like this one.
I got him.

288
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,389
Damn it.

289
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,168
Oh, shit.

290
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,680
- Damn.
- What's wrong?

291
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,099
We've been riding red
for the past hour.

292
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,268
Better make sure
we don't get forgot.

293
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,581
- You out?
- Running on fumes.

294
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,875
We can't stay here.

295
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,543
We can't all fit in one car.

296
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,462
We'll have to make a run
for some gas in the morning.

297
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,214
- Spend the night here?
- I'm freezing.

298
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,716
We'll build a fire, yeah?

299
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,010
You go out looking
for firewood, stay close.

300
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,387
Only got so many arrows.
How you doing on ammo?

301
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,097
Not enough.

302
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,849
We can't just sit here
with our asses hanging out.

303
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,642
Watch your mouth.

304
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,728
Everyone stop panicking
and listen to Rick.

305
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,063
All right, we'll set up
a perimeter.

306
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,566
In the morning, we'll find gas
and some supplies.

307
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,984
We'll keep pushing on.

308
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,487
Glenn and I can go make a run now,
try and scrounge up some gas.

309
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,822
No, we stay together.
God forbid something happens

310
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,532
and people get
stranded without a car.

311
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,243
Rick, we're stranded now.

312
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,497
I know it looks bad, we've all been
through hell and worse,

313
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,540
but at least
we found each other.

314
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,251
I wasn't sure--
I really wasn't--

315
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,378
but we did.
We're together.

316
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,589
We keep it that way.

317
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,470
We'll find shelter somewhere.
There's gotta be a place.

318
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,768
Rick, look around.
Okay?

319
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,020
There's walkers everywhere.
They're migrating or something.

320
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,606
There's gotta be a place
not just where we hole up,

321
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,483
but that we fortify,

322
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,237
hunker down,
pull ourselves together,

323
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,905
build a life for each other.

324
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,699
I know it's out there.
We just have to find it.

325
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,202
Even if we do find a place

326
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,162
and we think it's safe,

327
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,456
we can never be sure.
For how long?

328
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,875
Look what happened
with the farm.

329
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,419
We fooled ourselves
into thinking that that was safe.

330
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,713
We won't make
that mistake again.

331
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,717
We'll make camp tonight

332
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,679
over there, get on the road
at the break of day.

333
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,391
Does this feel
right to you?

334
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,809
What if walkers
come through,

335
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,227
or another group
like Randall's?

336
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,604
You know
I found Randall, right?

337
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,440
He had turned,
but he wasn't bit.

338
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,904
- How's that possible?
- Rick, what the hell happened?

339
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,784
Shane killed Randall.
Just like he always wanted to.

340
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,203
And then the herd got him?

341
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,257
We're all infected.

342
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,141
What?

343
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:18,352
At the CDC,
Jenner told me.

344
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,064
Whatever it is,

345
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,483
we all carry it.

346
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,244
And you never
said anything?

347
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,413
Would it have made
a difference?

348
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,332
You knew this whole time?

349
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,792
How could I have known for sure?
You saw how crazy that mo--

350
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,337
That is not your call.

351
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,255
Okay, when I found out about
the walkers in the barn,

352
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,715
I told, for the good
of everyone.

353
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,051
Well, I thought it best
that people didn't know.

354
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:43,938
I'm sure
you had your reasons.

355
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,192
- Is there anything that--
- I killed him.

356
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,657
I killed Shane.

357
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,496
He came at me.

358
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,627
He killed Randall
to get me into the woods.

359
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,838
He planned it.

360
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,342
I had--
I had no choice.

361
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,183
I gave him every chance...

362
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,188
and he kept
leading me further out.

363
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,862
He pushed me,
and I let him.

364
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,325
After awhile, I knew--

365
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,870
I knew what he was doing,
what he was up to.

366
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,125
And I kept going.

367
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,421
I didn't stop.

368
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,091
I could have, but...

369
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,554
I just wanted it over.

370
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,476
Dogging me
every step of the way.

371
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:08,355
Acting like I stole
you and Carl, like--

372
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,525
like I was in the way.

373
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,702
I just wanted it over.

374
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,415
I wanted him dead.

375
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,256
I killed him.

376
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,431
He turned.

377
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,643
That's how I knew Jenner--

378
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,020
Jenner was right.

379
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,362
Carl put him down.

380
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,709
We're not safe with him--

381
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,337
keeping something
like that from us.

382
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,841
Why do you need him?
He's just gonna pull you down.

383
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,178
No. Rick's done
all right by me.

384
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,305
You're his henchman

385
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,016
and I'm a burden.

386
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,060
We deserve better.

387
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,313
What do you want?

388
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,525
A man of honor.

389
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,027
Rick has honor.

390
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,741
I think we should
take our chances.

391
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,743
Don't be foolish.

392
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,746
There's no food, no fuel,

393
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,915
no ammo.

394
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:58,210
- What was that?
- Could be anything.

395
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,004
Could be a raccoon,
could be a possum.

396
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,172
A walker.

397
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,550
We need to leave.
What are we waiting for?

398
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:08,012
- Which way?
- It came from over there.

399
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,014
- Back from where we came.
- Yeah.

400
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,225
The last thing we need is for everyone
to be running off in the dark.

401
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,561
We don't have the vehicles.

402
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,604
No one's traveling on foot.

403
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,690
Don't panic.

404
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,608
I'm not--

405
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,695
I'm not sitting here, waiting for
another herd to blow through.

406
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,865
- We need to move, now.
- No one is going anywhere.

407
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,954
- Do something.
- I am doing something!

408
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,748
I'm keeping
this group together,

409
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,249
alive.

410
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,626
I've been doing that all along,
no matter what.

411
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,880
I didn't ask for this.
I killed my best friend

412
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,882
for you people,
for Christ's sake!

413
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,267
You saw what he was like,

414
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,478
how he pushed me,

415
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,230
how he compromised us,

416
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,609
how he threatened us.

417
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,112
He staged
the whole Randall thing,

418
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,406
led me out to put
a bullet in my back.

419
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,408
He gave me no choice.

420
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,870
He was my friend,
but he came after me.

421
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,961
My hands are clean.

422
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,517
Maybe you people are
better off without me.

423
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,353
Go ahead.

424
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,814
I say there's a place for us,

425
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,649
but maybe-- maybe it's
just another pipe dream.

426
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:47,111
Maybe-- maybe I'm
fooling myself again.

427
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,447
Why don't you-- why don't you go
and find out yourself?

428
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,574
Send me a postcard.

429
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,911
Go on, there's the door.

430
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,706
You can do better?
Let's see how far you get.

431
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:08,549
No takers? Fine.
But get one thing straight--

432
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,803
you're staying,

433
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,556
this isn't
a democracy anymore.
