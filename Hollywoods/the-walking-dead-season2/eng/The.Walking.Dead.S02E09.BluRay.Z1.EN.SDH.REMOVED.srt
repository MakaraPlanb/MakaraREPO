1
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,978
Holy shit.

2
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,190
You all right?

3
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,983
Yeah.

4
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,944
Hershel?

5
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,634
Let's head back.

6
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,829
Car. Car.

7
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,039
Get down.

8
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,391
- Dave? Tony?
- He said over here?

9
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,017
Yeah. I'm telling you,
man, I heard shots.

10
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,519
I saw roamers two streets over.

11
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,895
- Might be more around here.
- It's hot.

12
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,814
- We gotta get out of here.
- Dave! Tony!

13
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,816
Shut up, you idiot!
You wanna attract 'em?

14
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,485
Just stick close.
We're gonna find 'em.

15
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,701
Dude, he said to stay close.

16
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,911
Tony.

17
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,457
Shit!

18
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,086
No!

19
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,637
They should've
been back by now.

20
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,891
Yeah. They just got
holed up somewhere.

21
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,395
We'll head out
first thing tomorrow.

22
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,397
Thank you.

23
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,691
You're welcome.

24
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,317
- Here.
- Thanks.

25
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,405
Carl, I want you to keep
your head up, okay?

26
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,532
Your old man,
he's the toughest son of a--

27
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,576
No cussing
in the house.

28
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,579
Sorry.

29
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,206
- Lori, dinner.
- She's not in there.

30
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,666
Where is she?

31
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,175
Carl, when's the last time
you saw your mom?

32
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,760
This afternoon.

33
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,011
She was worried about Rick,

34
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,888
asked me
to look in on Carl.

35
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,681
- She went after them?
- She didn't say that.

36
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,893
Nobody panic.
Gonna be around here somewhere.

37
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,759
- Why won't they leave?
- Would you?

38
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,385
We can't sit here any longer.

39
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,638
Let's head out the back
and make a run to the car.

40
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,481
- What happened?
- Roamers, I nailed 'em.

41
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,941
They disappeared,
but their car's still there.

42
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,943
I cleared those buildings.
You guys get this one?

43
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,570
- No.
- Me neither.

44
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,781
We're looking for Dave and Tony
and no one checks the damn bar?

45
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,288
- What?
- Someone pushed that shut.

46
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,082
There's someone in there.

47
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,167
Yo, is someone in there?

48
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,086
Yo, if someone's in there,
we don't want no trouble.

49
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,004
We're just looking
for our friends.

50
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,340
- What do we do?
- Bum rush the door?

51
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,175
No, we don't know how
many are there. Just relax.

52
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,511
We don't want any trouble.

53
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,263
We're just looking
for our friends.

54
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,181
If something happened,
tell us.

55
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,851
This place is
crawling with corpses.

56
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,020
If you can help us not get killed,
I'd appreciate it.

57
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,024
Dude, you're bugging.
I'm telling you nobody's in there.

58
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,694
Someone grab the door.
If they're in there,

59
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,320
they might know where
Dave and Tony are.

60
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,039
They drew on us!

61
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,007
Dave and Tony in there?

62
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,509
They alive?

63
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,808
- No.
- They killed Dave and Tony.

64
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,144
- Come on, man, let's go.
- No, I'm not leaving,

65
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,229
I'm not telling Jane.
I'm not gonna go back and tell them

66
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,023
that Dave and Tony got shot
by some assholes in a bar.

67
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,192
Your friends drew on us!

68
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,986
They gave us no choice!

69
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,697
I'm sure we've
all lost enough people,

70
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,327
done things we wish
we didn't have to,

71
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,413
but it's like that now.
You know that!

72
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,334
So let's just chalk
this up to what it was--

73
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,336
wrong place,

74
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,379
wrong--

75
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,760
Get out of here! Go!

76
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,083
We can't find Lori.

77
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,252
And the others
aren't back yet either.

78
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,213
That dumb bitch must've
gone off looking for 'em.

79
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,216
- What?
- Yeah, she asked me to go.

80
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,593
I told her I was done
being an errand boy.

81
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,429
And you didn't say anything?

82
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,573
Don't do this.

83
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,575
Please.

84
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,911
I've already lost my girl.

85
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,497
That wasn't
my problem neither.

86
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,256
- She's not at the barn.
- I checked the yards.

87
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,426
- Well, where is she?
- She asked Daryl to go into town.

88
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,928
Must've gone herself.

89
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,681
Hey.

90
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,434
Carl.

91
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,270
- Did you know about this?
- No.

92
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,856
Look, just--
did she take a gun?

93
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,649
I don't know.

94
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,485
I wouldn't let her
go out there alone.

95
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,049
Hey!

96
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,970
We all know this is not
gonna end well!

97
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,015
There's nothing in it
for any of us!

98
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,852
You guys just--
just back off,

99
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,979
no one else gets hurt!

100
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,001
Shit!

101
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,097
Glenn! Glenn!

102
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,433
I-- I'm all right.
I'm all right.

103
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,354
Lori.

104
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,327
I'll hold 'em here.
You cover Glenn.

105
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,288
See if he can make it
to your car.

106
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,540
Tell him-- tell him
to pull up back.

107
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,210
We'll run for it,
get the hell out of here.

108
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,794
You want me
to cover Glenn?

109
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,130
You missed
all that gun training.

110
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,632
It could've come
in handy now.

111
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,593
No, I can shoot.
I just don't like to.

112
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,480
Sorry. Sorry.

113
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,565
Rick wants you
to try for the car.

114
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,150
Try?

115
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,736
You'll try and succeed.

116
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,863
I'll cover you.

117
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,491
That's a great plan.

118
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,833
- What happened?
- He fired.

119
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,670
He must have hit Glenn.

120
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,547
He's behind the dumpster.

121
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,882
Doesn't look like
he's moving.

122
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,467
Help!

123
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,765
You hit?

124
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,109
Are you hit?

125
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,988
No. No.

126
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,499
It's all right.
The car's right there.

127
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,752
- Okay.
- We're almost home.

128
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,712
- You good?
- I'm good.

129
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,928
Let's go.

130
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,973
Get back.

131
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,354
Let's get out of here!

132
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,105
Roamers all over the place!
Hurry up!

133
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,441
- We gotta get out of here!
- What about Sean?

134
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,361
They shot him. We gotta go.
Roamers are everywhere.

135
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,655
- We're leaving?
- Jump!

136
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,658
Hurry up,
jump already.

137
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,039
Dude didn't make it.

138
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,624
Help me!

139
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,292
I've gotta go.

140
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,128
- I'm sorry!
- No, no, don't leave!

141
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:49,299
Help me! No! No!

142
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,470
- Help! Help!
- Get Hershel.

143
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,056
Help! Help me!

144
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,308
Hershel!

145
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,520
No!

146
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,990
Hershel!

147
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:27,045
Hershel. Hershel.

148
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,176
The gunfire must've
attracted the walkers.

149
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,595
- Where's Rick?
- He ran across.

150
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,764
Well, hell,
we can't go without him.

151
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,975
Rick!

152
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,437
- We have to go now.
- No!

153
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,522
- Shh!
- I'm sorry, son. We have to go.

154
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,941
- No, no, don't leave me, please.
- We have to go.

155
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,110
- We can't.
- He was just shooting at us!

156
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,445
- He's a kid.
- Please help me.

157
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,363
This place is
crawling with walkers!

158
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,158
- We can't leave him!
- The fence went clean through.

159
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,869
There's no way we can get
the leg off in one piece.

160
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,203
Shut up!

161
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,955
Shut up
or I will shoot you!

162
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,290
That may be the answer.

163
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,208
We're not gonna get
that leg off

164
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,793
without tearing
the muscle to shreds.

165
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,129
He certainly can't run.
He may bleed out.

166
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,381
Shut up.

167
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,300
I'm sorry.
Sh-sh-- shut up.

168
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,260
- Shut up.
- Maybe we should put him down.

169
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,514
I don't wanna see any more killing,
but this is cruel.

170
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,308
Can't we just take the leg off?

171
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,147
- That hatchet still in the car?
- No, no, don't-- don't--

172
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,899
don't cut
my leg off, please.

173
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,817
- Please, not my leg.
- Will this cut through the bone?

174
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,819
I'll have to sever the ligaments
below the kneecap,

175
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,572
cut above the tibia.
He's going to lose his lower leg.

176
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,908
- No, no, no.
- When we get clear of here,

177
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,911
we're gonna have to find some tinder,
cauterize the wound

178
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,163
- so he doesn't bleed out.
- All right, no choice. Hurry up.

179
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,998
Oh, God! Oh, God!

180
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,459
- No!
- Hand me that stick.

181
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,838
Here.

182
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,967
Guys, walkers.

183
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,552
- Shut up!
- Oh, my God!

184
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,348
Hurry up!

185
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,021
Shut up!

186
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,732
Oh, God.
They're everywhere.

187
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,195
Hershel, how we doing
over there?

188
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,073
I need more hands!
Easy, son, easy.

189
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,828
No, don't!
Don't cut my leg off, please.

190
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,874
Come on, we gotta go!
I'm almost out of ammo!

191
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,460
We don't have much time!
Come on, we've gotta go!

192
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,797
I can't hold 'em off!
Hershel, do it now!

193
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,882
- Come on, Hershel!
- There is no time!

194
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,384
Hershel, come on!

195
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:40,053
Please, don't leave me!
Please! No!

196
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,889
No, don't leave me!
Please! Please, don't leave me!

197
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,907
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

198
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,784
You're not fine.
I saw the wreck.

199
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,496
Let me look at you. Oh.

200
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,415
What happened?

201
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,126
Looked down at the map
and hit a walker.

202
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,169
Next time stay put,
you won't need a map.

203
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,630
Come on,
I've gotta get you back.

204
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,966
No, we got to find Rick.

205
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,053
He's back.
They're all back.

206
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,097
They're all safe
and sound.

207
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

208
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,854
Oh, thank God.

209
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,306
- What are you doing?
- God.

210
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,642
Keeping an eye on you.

211
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,352
Ain't you a peach?

212
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm not gonna
let you pull away.

213
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,315
You've earned your place.

214
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,192
If you spent half
your time minding

215
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,902
your daughter's business
instead of sticking your nose

216
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,820
in everybody else's,
she'd still be alive!

217
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,533
Go ahead.

218
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,328
Go ahead and what?

219
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,041
Man, just go!
I don't want you here!

220
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,254
You're a real piece
of work, lady.

221
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,842
What, are you gonna make this about
my daddy or some crap like that?

222
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,595
Pfft!
Man, you don't know jack.

223
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,722
You're afraid.

224
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,183
You're afraid
'cause you're all alone.

225
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,520
You got no husband,
no daughter.

226
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,855
You don't know what
to do with yourself.

227
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,192
You ain't my problem!
Sophia wasn't mine!

228
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,529
All you had to do was
keep an eye on her!

229
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,546
Yeah.

230
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,523
Oh, my God, are you all right?
What happened?

231
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,941
- I was in an accident. I'm fine.
- She was attacked.

232
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,485
I'm fine, I really am.
Where's Rick?

233
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,325
They're not back?

234
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,038
Where are they?

235
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,750
Look, I had to
get you back here.

236
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,254
- You asshole.
- Lori.

237
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,922
- He's my husband.
- Lori, I will go after him.

238
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,633
I will find him. Hey!
Now, look, first things first--

239
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,385
I gotta--
I gotta look after you.

240
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,596
I gotta make sure
the baby's all right, okay?

241
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,933
You're having a baby?

242
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,270
Why didn't you tell me?

243
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,911
Come on.
Let's make sure you're all right.

244
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,621
Come on.

245
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,516
Thank you.

246
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,188
Hey.

247
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,483
I am so sorry

248
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,944
that I left
without telling you.

249
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,946
It's okay.

250
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,989
I wasn't scared.

251
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,868
When's Dad getting back?

252
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,498
Let's hope soon.

253
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,501
I wanna be there when
you tell him about the baby.

254
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,629
Oh, he already knows.

255
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,508
We were just trying
to find the right time to tell you.

256
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,635
Is it a boy or a girl?

257
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,305
Well, we won't know that
until it's born.

258
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,559
- Will I be able to feel it?
- Not for a while.

259
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:43,356
You must have a lot
of questions, huh?

260
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,861
We never had the talk.

261
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,282
I guess we forgot.

262
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,745
Don't look at me.
That's your father's job.

263
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,584
If the baby's a girl,
can we name her Sophia?

264
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,214
Hey, dude.

265
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,217
Hey, I'm sorry, bud.
Okay?

266
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,762
- I thought you knew.
- Big brother Carl.

267
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,183
- Pretty cool, huh?
- I say that's very cool.

268
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,314
You-- you mind if I talk
to your mom a sec? Hmm?

269
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,941
How about a little later,
after she's had some rest?

270
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,402
Lori, I had to get
you back here.

271
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,904
You wouldn't
have come otherwise.

272
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,245
How about you--

273
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,582
how about you just
hear me out, please?

274
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,667
It's okay.

275
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,297
Will you give me a minute?

276
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,258
Thanks, bud.

277
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,566
Okay, Lori, it was a lie.

278
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,069
It was one little white lie.

279
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,737
But I think that--

280
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,781
I think you oughta be
thinking about

281
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,241
how lucky we are
that the baby's safe.

282
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,576
You just can't
stop lying, can you?

283
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,787
My husband is back
safe and sound.

284
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,665
- My husband is dead in some hospital.
- Oh, when are you gonna--

285
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,251
when are you gonna stop
throwing that in my face, huh?

286
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,127
I thought that he was--

287
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,131
the point here, Lor,

288
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,093
is that you cannot keep
running off like that.

289
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,511
What were you thinking about?

290
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,304
I was thinking we needed
Rick here to keep us safe.

291
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,640
Rick?
I keep you safe.

292
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,642
Like you did with Otis?

293
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,480
What happened that night?

294
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,025
You haven't been
the same since.

295
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,153
You wanna know
what happened with Otis?

296
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,657
What happened with Otis happened
because I love you.

297
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:02,495
I love you and I love Carl.
That's right.

298
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,497
I told Rick.

299
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,340
What?

300
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,097
You told--
you told him what?

301
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,854
Did you tell him that you thought
you were a widow?

302
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,982
That you were grieving and that
the world was coming to an end?

303
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,319
That-- that you
needed comforting?

304
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,195
Did you tell him
it was a mistake?

305
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,905
Mm-hmm.

306
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,208
You know, Lori,
that ain't true.

307
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,880
What we had...

308
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,465
it was real.

309
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,342
- It was not.
- It was a long time coming.

310
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,010
- It was real, Lori.
- It was not.

311
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:03,056
It was you and it was me
and Carl, and it was real.

312
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,351
It was right.
Don't say it wasn't.

313
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,395
It wasn't.

314
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,690
Just think about
what you felt,

315
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,401
just for a second.
What you fe-- what you felt.

316
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,571
Everything falling apart
all around us,

317
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,239
but it--

318
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,243
it was the one good thing.

319
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,794
And you know it's true.

320
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,448
How is she?

321
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,118
Dehydrated.

322
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,996
I'll set up an IV.

323
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,332
Best I can do
without Hershel.

324
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,005
Hey.

325
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,143
Can I get you anything?

326
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,895
Nah, I just wish
my dad was here.

327
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,647
She'll be okay.

328
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,483
You just need
to be strong for her.

329
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,821
I was just
reminding her about--

330
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,241
- Never mind.
- No, no.

331
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,410
I'd love to hear.

332
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,874
My dad would die
if he heard this.

333
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,084
My first summer
back from college,

334
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,545
I drove home,
dumped my stuff off,

335
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,255
went straight out
to the stable for a ride.

336
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,383
My family comes back
from church

337
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,595
and Beth grabs my things and starts
unpacking my stuff upstairs.

338
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,889
- That's sweet.
- Yeah, until this one here

339
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,557
starts rifling
through my backpack.

340
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,144
She finds this little
plastic container

341
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,564
with these pink and green
candies inside.

342
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,441
She didn't even know
I was on the pill.

343
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,737
She was so freaked out
by the idea of me and boys and sex

344
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,907
that she runs outside and chucks
them in the duck pond.

345
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,286
And I ride up,
I see this, I'm screaming.

346
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,289
She's crying
and Shawn runs outside,

347
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,291
thinks one of us
is drowning.

348
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,336
Soon as he figures out
what's going on,

349
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,130
the jerk busts out
laughing so loud

350
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:45,718
that my horse rears up
and gets mud all over the three of us.

351
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:51,516
My dad comes out, "What the heck
is going on out here?!"

352
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,019
And she turns around,

353
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,356
bats her eyelids and says,
"We're just swimming, Daddy."

354
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,615
In her Sunday dress,
all covered in snot and mud.

355
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,455
Rick and Glenn will get
your dad back.

356
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,878
Glenn's a good guy.

357
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,592
Yeah. He is.

358
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,142
Are you sure
you wanna risk it?

359
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,603
- You might not make it back.
- I'll be fine.

360
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,648
And with Shane at the helm,
I wouldn't be too sure.

361
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,109
He's lost people before.

362
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:45,861
And he's had my back.
What are you insinuating?

363
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,197
He doesn't want Rick back,

364
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,907
or Hershel.

365
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,451
With them gone,
he's got everything he wants

366
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,579
and no one
to tell him otherwise.

367
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,373
Shane has done more
to keep this group alive

368
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,709
than anybody,
including Rick.

369
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,295
You can't possibly
believe that.

370
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,255
I do.

371
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,099
Guys.

372
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,209
Dad!

373
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,344
You're okay.

374
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,683
Patricia, prepare the shed
for surgery.

375
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,690
- Are you hurt?
- No, but what happened to you?

376
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,485
- I was in a car accident.
- Accident? How?

377
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,986
I went looking for you.

378
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,947
Snuck out on her own.
I brought her back.

379
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,909
- Are you crazy? You could've--
- Who the hell is that?

380
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,204
That's Randall.

381
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,011
We couldn't just
leave him behind.

382
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,055
He would've bled out,

383
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,057
if he lived that long.

384
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,850
It's gotten bad in town.

385
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,563
What do we do with him?

386
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,525
I repaired his calf muscle
as best I can,

387
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,193
but he'll probably
have nerve damage.

388
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,696
Won't be on his feet
for at least a week.

389
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,322
When he is,
we give him a canteen,

390
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,825
take him out to the main road,
send him on his way.

391
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,077
Isn't that the same
as leaving him for the walkers?

392
00:33:58,245 --> 00:33:59,829
He'll have
a fighting chance.

393
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,082
Just gonna let him go?
He knows where we are.

394
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,583
He was blindfolded
the whole way here.

395
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,085
- He's not a threat.
- Not a threat.

396
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,546
How many of them were there?
You killed three of their men,

397
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,005
you took one of them hostage,

398
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,799
but they just ain't
gonna come looking for him?

399
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,635
They left him for dead.
No one is looking.

400
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,095
We should still post a guard.

401
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:19,348
He's out cold right now,
will be for hours.

402
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,184
I'm gonna go get him
some flowers and candy.

403
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,687
Look at this, folks--

404
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,355
we back in Fantasyland.

405
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,275
You know, we haven't even dealt
with what you did at my barn yet.

406
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:32,319
Let me make this perfectly clear,
once and for all--

407
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,531
this is my farm.
Now I wanted you gone.

408
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,701
Rick talked me out of it,
but that doesn't mean I have to like it.

409
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:42,079
So do us both a favor--
keep your mouth shut.

410
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,679
Look, we're not gonna do
anything about it today.

411
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,556
Let's just cool off.

412
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,620
Can I talk to you?

413
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,797
What's going on
with you?

414
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,802
Your dad saved
my life today.

415
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,305
And Rick saved us both.

416
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,808
And I--

417
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,102
I froze.

418
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,687
Well, you were
being shot at.

419
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,648
No, that...

420
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,277
- You don't have anything to prove.
- All I've done,

421
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,656
then this-- okay.

422
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,119
It's because
of what you said.

423
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,831
That I love you?

424
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,749
Yeah.

425
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,127
A bullet hit
the wall behind me

426
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,296
and I-- I thought of you--

427
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,632
losing me, hurting.

428
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,426
And I couldn't take it,
so I hid

429
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,679
to stay alive.

430
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,975
- Glenn.
- No, no, no.

431
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,644
No, you don't get it.

432
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,981
Rick, your dad--
they were counting on me

433
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,109
and I--
I only thought of myself.

434
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,143
Has she eaten?

435
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,647
I'll give her a sedative--

436
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,483
stop her body from
working too hard.

437
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,905
You were drinking.

438
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,782
That was the least
of my worries.

439
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,785
You left and I didn't know
what to do!

440
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,349
- Want me to take watch?
- Yeah.

441
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:53,020
Relieve T in a few hours.
I'm gonna take the graveyard.

442
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,105
And then what?

443
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,107
We just send him
on his merry way?

444
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,611
According to Rick and Hershel.

445
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,030
If he finds his people
and leads them here,

446
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,573
we'll have a war
on our hands.

447
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,617
You know, you're preaching
to the choir, girl.

448
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,119
You ever consider
a lighter touch?

449
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,455
Abandoning
the search for Sophia,

450
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,208
taking out the walkers in the barn,
lying to Lori today--

451
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,293
those were
all the right calls.

452
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,796
It's your presentation that leaves
something to be desired.

453
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,339
Dale send you?

454
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,258
I see you pushing
everyone away.

455
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,594
For what?
They need you.

456
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,722
Huh. I'll always be
the odd man out--

457
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,475
- the same as you.
- I've made my peace.

458
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,812
Have you?
The way I see it,

459
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,357
you and me, we--
we're treated the same way.

460
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,986
Everyone's always trying to take
the gun out of your hand.

461
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,029
These folks--
they want to play house.

462
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,739
They wanna pretend
that Rick and Hershel--

463
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,866
they know what they're doing.
Let me tell you something--

464
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,285
- they bound to get us all killed.
- Then we have to stop that.

465
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,496
They don't listen. They're gonna
give this kid a care package.

466
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,206
They're gonna send him on his way.
And you're right.

467
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,291
That's gonna bring on a war
or something worse,

468
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,545
and we're just gonna--
we're gonna sit here and wait for it.

469
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,631
But you and me...

470
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,718
we're the only ones
who see it coming.

471
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,722
I should've left with you
when I had the chance.

472
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,525
Oh, man.

473
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,737
Come here.

474
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,032
Thank you.

475
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,043
Need your help.

476
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,586
Come here.

477
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,929
We're like a couple of old people.

478
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,316
We need to talk
about Shane.

479
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,195
What's he done now?

480
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,450
He thinks the baby's his.

481
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,792
No matter what, it's yours.

482
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,301
He'll accept that.

483
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,054
You're gonna have to make him.
He won't listen to me.

484
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,807
He's delusional
and he's dangerous.

485
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,894
When I went looking for you,
he came after me.

486
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,355
- Well, of course he did.
- And he lied to me

487
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,482
to get me back here,
said you were already back.

488
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,651
What?

489
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,112
You saw what he did
at the barn.

490
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,781
He's threatened Dale
and Hershel.

491
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,991
He's scaring people.
He's scaring me.

492
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,622
And I think he killed Otis.

493
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,334
I think he left him behind
and I think--

494
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,839
I think he did it
not just to save Carl,

495
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,425
- but because he loves me...
- But you don't know that.

496
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,513
...and he thinks that we're
supposed to be together

497
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,348
no matter what.

498
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,190
Those gunmen left
that kid behind today.

499
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:32,030
I killed two people
myself because of you,

500
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,367
and Carl, and the baby.

501
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:39,288
It was gonna be me
and not them no matter what.

502
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,963
You killed the living
to protect what's yours?

503
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,632
That's right.

504
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,177
Shane thinks I'm his.

505
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,805
He thinks the baby's his.

506
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,351
And he says
you can't protect us,

507
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,562
that you're gonna
get us killed.

508
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,568
He's dangerous, Rick,
and he won't stop.
