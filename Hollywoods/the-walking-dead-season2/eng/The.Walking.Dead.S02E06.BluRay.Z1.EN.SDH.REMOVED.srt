1
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,680
Don't look so worried.

2
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,390
It's my job.

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,184
No, it's not.
You're a housewife.

4
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,520
Yeah, punk?

5
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,188
You see my house
around here?

6
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,692
Housewife.

7
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:33,116
They don't have a mother.

8
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,618
She might be
somewhere else.

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,745
Maybe she got eaten.

10
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,875
Everything is food
for something else.

11
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,100
Could you be more obvious?

12
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,979
Here, enjoy.

13
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,897
Are you trying to buy
my silence with fruit?

14
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,775
Of course not.
There's also jerky.

15
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,653
Will you please tell me why your dad
has a secret barn full of walkers?

16
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,405
- It's creepy.
- Shh.

17
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,031
- You know that, right?
- Shh.

18
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,741
Just trust me
on this, okay?

19
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,702
But I suck at lying.

20
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,037
I can't even play poker.
It's too much like lying.

21
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,831
You have to keep this
to yourself.

22
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,750
You have to. Please.

23
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,885
Dale, here's some
peaches for you.

24
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,678
Mm, thank you.

25
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,472
- Morning.
- Morning.

26
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,560
- 'Sup?
- Nothing.

27
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,729
Nothing's up.
Why?

28
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,660
Hey.

29
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,955
This is not
that great, but...

30
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,711
What, no pictures?

31
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,255
I'm so sorry.
I feel like shit.

32
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,382
Yeah, you and me both.

33
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,217
I don't expect you
to forgive me,

34
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,762
but if there's
anything I can do...

35
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,847
You were trying
to protect the group.

36
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,933
We're good.

37
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,606
But, hey,

38
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,901
shoot me again,
you'd best pray I'm dead.

39
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,993
What did Rick say?

40
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,121
You didn't tell him?

41
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,123
Okay.

42
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,833
But you have to.

43
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,961
You're pregnant.

44
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,255
You need vitamins, medicine,
a nice pillow.

45
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,387
You can have my share.

46
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,639
Honey, I don't want
your food, okay? Eat.

47
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,558
You need to eat.
You're too skinny.

48
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,270
And if you're not gonna let Rick take
care of you, then someone has to.

49
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,483
Lori, you have
a medical condition.

50
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,364
I'll make another run into town.
Just tell me what you need.

51
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,866
I need you to be quiet
about this.

52
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,160
All right? Please.

53
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,205
Hey! Peach man.

54
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,215
The creek flows south,
past that farmhouse Daryl found.

55
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,009
Maybe Sophia dropped
the doll there,

56
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,719
the current
brought it downstream.

57
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,763
So what, you think she took this road
here and then she went north?

58
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,098
Yeah.
What's up that way?

59
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,683
A housing development.

60
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,184
It went in
maybe 10 years ago.

61
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,853
Take a run up there
after gun practice.

62
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,272
I'll hold down the fort here,
but take backup.

63
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,274
After what went down
with Daryl,

64
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,609
I don't want anyone going out alone.
We stay in pairs.

65
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,319
I'll take suggestions
on a partner.

66
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,614
See how they do on the range,
then take your pick.

67
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,328
Thanks.

68
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,465
My binoculars.

69
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,925
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,557
Okay, bye.

71
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,064
We'd like to join you
for gun training today.

72
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,732
Hershel's been very clear.

73
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,234
I can't involve any of you in what
we do without his okay.

74
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,737
He doesn't like it,
but he consented.

75
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,907
Otis was the only one
who knew guns.

76
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,492
Now that he's gone,

77
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,494
we gotta learn
to protect ourselves.

78
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,871
Her father saw
the sense in that.

79
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,124
No offense, but I'll ask
Hershel myself.

80
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,628
Dude, nice lid, man.

81
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,255
What's going on?

82
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,926
I want to learn
to shoot, too.

83
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,345
Can you teach me?

84
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:13,766
Well, man, that's--
that's up to your parents.

85
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,769
Can you talk to them?
They'll listen to you.

86
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,441
We'll see, okay?

87
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,905
Hey.

88
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,615
Let me see what
you've got there.

89
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,833
Come on.

90
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,044
How the hell
did this happen?

91
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:46,340
Well, it's my fault.
I let him into the RV.

92
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,927
He said he wanted a walkie,
that you sent him for one.

93
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,638
So on top of everything else,
he lied.

94
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,016
What's he thinking?

95
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,769
He wants to learn how to shoot.
He asked me to teach him.

96
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,230
Now it's none of
my business,

97
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,816
but I'm happy to do it.
It's your call.

98
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,026
Well, I'm not
comfortable with it.

99
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,534
Oh, don't make me out to be
the unreasonable one here. Rick?

100
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,078
I know.
I have my concerns too, but--

101
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,205
There's no but.
He was just shot.

102
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,208
He's just back on his feet
and he wants a gun?

103
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,377
Better than him
being afraid of 'em.

104
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,379
There are guns in camp
for a reason.

105
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,381
He should learn
to handle them safely.

106
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,383
I don't want my kid
walking around with a gun.

107
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,718
How can you
defend that?

108
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,928
You can't let him go around
without protection.

109
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,514
He's as safe as
he'll ever be right here.

110
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,558
Look, everything
you're saying

111
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,186
makes perfect sense.
It feels wrong.

112
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,188
I mean,
I didn't feel good

113
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,231
about him following you
out into the woods.

114
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,567
And I wish I'd said something.
I should've gone with my gut.

115
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,527
He's growing up,
thank God.

116
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,405
We've got to start treating him
more like an adult.

117
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,990
Then he needs
to act like one.

118
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,992
He's not mature enough
to handle a gun.

119
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,077
I'm not gonna
play with it, Mom.

120
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,412
It's not a toy.

121
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,872
I'm sorry
I disappointed you,

122
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,790
but I want to look
for Sophia.

123
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,126
I want to defend
our camp.

124
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,711
I can't do that
without a gun.

125
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,214
Shane's the best
instructor I know.

126
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,092
I've seen him teach kids
younger than Carl.

127
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,105
You will take this seriously

128
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,732
and you will
behave responsibly.

129
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,234
And if I hear from anyone
in this camp

130
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,402
that you are not living up
to our expectations--

131
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
He won't let you down.

132
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,406
Yeah.

133
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,747
Now if we're gonna do this,
you listen to Shane.

134
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,249
- Okay, Dad.
- All right?

135
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,334
- You be careful.
- You coming?

136
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,128
I gotta help Dale clean
the spark plugs on the RV.

137
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,630
He said he's gonna
teach me mechanics.

138
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,257
I should probably go
look for him.

139
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,801
You found me.

140
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,722
He's a good learner.

141
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,077
Spark plugs, huh?

142
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,037
Want to tell me
what's going on?

143
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,999
You're old.

144
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,584
You're-- you know things.

145
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,297
So what if somebody
told you something

146
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,717
that somebody else
should know--?

147
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,969
Glenn, stop being dramatic.
Spit it out.

148
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,805
There's-- there's walkers
in the barn

149
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,473
and Lori's pregnant.

150
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,070
Hey, come on, man.
Don't give me that gangsta shit.

151
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,994
Attaboy.

152
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,539
Don't be discouraged.

153
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,249
You'll hit the target
eventually.

154
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,793
Who says I didn't hit
my target?

155
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,431
Try this one.
It's heavy.

156
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,516
You get better balance,
twice the rounds.

157
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,406
I'd say she's got
the hang of it.

158
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,784
I'd say she's ready
for the advanced class.

159
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,786
It might be
worth your while

160
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,537
after the rest of us
head back to camp.

161
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,872
Sure. Why not?

162
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,168
- How's it feeling?
- I like the weight.

163
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,671
So you decided
not to leave us.

164
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,507
Something change your mind?

165
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,014
- Got it.
- That's a great shot.

166
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,818
Nervous Nelly.

167
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,322
She find her way home?

168
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,575
Found her in her stall
this morning.

169
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,671
I love your fields.

170
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,716
Took a long walk
this morning.

171
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:44,179
I ended up by the barn.

172
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,351
I heard the moans.

173
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,020
That's unfortunate.

174
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,190
I'm sure you have your reasons
for keeping this a secret.

175
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,026
I saw the broadcasts
before they stopped,

176
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,280
saw the irrational fear,
the atrocities,

177
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,074
like the incident
at my well.

178
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,951
We put down a walker.

179
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,455
You killed a person.

180
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,667
Well, if you watched
the same broadcasts I did,

181
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,795
you saw walkers attack, kill.

182
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,131
They're dangerous.

183
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,675
A paranoid schizophrenic
is dangerous, too.

184
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,635
We don't shoot
sick people.

185
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,888
With all due respect,

186
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,433
you are cut off
from the outside world here.

187
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,435
But I've seen people
that I cared about

188
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,229
die and come back,

189
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,316
and they're not people.

190
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,819
My wife and stepson

191
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,030
are in that barn.

192
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,493
They're people.

193
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,828
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,500
Let me help.

195
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,003
I'll speak to Rick.
He's a good man.

196
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,714
We can make the barn more secure,
keep everybody safe.

197
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,259
The barn is secure.

198
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,970
Keep this to yourself
if you want to help.

199
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,765
Rick is a man of conscience,

200
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:14,019
but are you so sure about
everyone in your group?

201
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,158
Afternoon.

202
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,038
I take it your boy did well.

203
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,960
Not bad, actually.

204
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,212
Be grateful you don't
have a daughter.

205
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,215
If only things were as simple
as wanting to shoot.

206
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,634
Carl's getting that chance,
thanks to you.

207
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,970
And I'm eternally grateful

208
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,514
for what you did
and your hospitality.

209
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,599
We'll earn our keep.

210
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,186
I appreciate that,
but with Carl getting better,

211
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,230
I imagine you'll be
moving on soon--

212
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,402
Fort Benning, I hear.

213
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,340
- Still a virgin.
- The target's too small.

214
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,301
Come on, that's crap.
Half-hour ago

215
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,219
I saw you nail
a bull's-eye at 25 feet.

216
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,596
It wasn't moving.

217
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,681
You think a walker's
gonna hold still for you?

218
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,600
Focus and reload,
go again.

219
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,525
Uh-oh, did I piss you off?

220
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,444
Come on, girl, you've got
walkers all around you.

221
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,529
They're the woods.
They're in the RV.

222
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,281
You're gonna need more
than a damn screwdriver.

223
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,075
- Stop badgering me.
- You're too damn emotional.

224
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,494
You need to shut it down.
Take all that guilt,

225
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,455
take that fear,
that being pissed off, take it out.

226
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,915
Right, 'cause you're so calm.

227
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,460
See that?
See, I can be pissed off.

228
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,545
I could be whistling "Dixie"
and I'll always hit the target.

229
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,965
But you, God, you shoot
like a damn girl.

230
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,968
You stand here
and you point your weapon.

231
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,803
Point like you point your finger.
Do not think about it.

232
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,597
I'm talking about
muscle memory, girl--

233
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,098
muscle memory.

234
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,601
Now go on, shoot that
son of a bitch.

235
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,811
He's coming for you!
He's 10 feet away!

236
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,521
He's nine feet--
he's five feet away!

237
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,023
Right there, that's
the walker that got Amy.

238
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,484
Now you shoot that son of a bitch!
Shoot him!

239
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,298
Hershel expects us
to leave?

240
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,012
Does anybody else know?

241
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,432
Not yet.

242
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,062
- Were you gonna tell me?
- Of course.

243
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,022
When? How long
have you known?

244
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,858
Not long. You don't need
to worry about this.

245
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,111
How can you expect me not to worry?
We have shelter here

246
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,613
and food and water
and medical care.

247
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,199
I've been talking with Hershel.
It's not carved in stone.

248
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,992
He thinks it is.

249
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,703
We have to fix this.

250
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,205
People are settling in here.
They'll be devastated.

251
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,707
I know.
I'm working on it.

252
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,375
Maybe I can talk to him, too,
and plead our case.

253
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,210
No, things are uneasy.
The best thing right now

254
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,796
is to give Hershel
some space.

255
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,633
Don't look at me like that.

256
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,635
Like what?

257
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,679
Like you're scared.
Like you don't trust me.

258
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,056
I can take it from everyone
else, but not from you.

259
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,350
I don't understand
how you could keep

260
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,895
something like this
from me.

261
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,149
Carl's barely on his feet.
And Sophia's missing.

262
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,985
And Daryl and T-Dog are hurt.
How can we leave?

263
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,571
It's not what I want either,
but if we have to go,

264
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,948
I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure

265
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,867
you and Carl are okay.

266
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,786
We'll get by.
We will.

267
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,250
Okay.

268
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,055
Come on,
let me give you a lift.

269
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,349
My feet work just fine.

270
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,072
Look, I'm just trying
to get you rattled,

271
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,283
give you an idea

272
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,243
what it's like when
the shit starts to fly.

273
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,037
Is that an apology?

274
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,207
I crossed the line
when I brought Amy into it.

275
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,084
Yeah, it's an apology.

276
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,378
You're a real dick
sometimes.

277
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,672
Yeah, I acknowledge that.
I'll tell you what:

278
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,593
I've got a lead on Sophia.
I'm gonna go check it out.

279
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:00,180
Why don't you come with me,
be my backup?

280
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,479
Come on.

281
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,690
My wife was
pregnant once.

282
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,776
She miscarried

283
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,529
and we didn't try again
after that.

284
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,532
I'm so sorry.

285
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,534
The thing
that I remember most

286
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,203
is how nauseated
she became

287
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,039
at the smell
of cooking meat.

288
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,210
And she was
a meat-eating gal-- my wife,

289
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,547
but with the pregnancy...

290
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,883
That Thanksgiving,

291
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,135
the turkey--

292
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,805
she couldn't be
in the house

293
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,224
for two days until
it was aired out,

294
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,726
poor thing.

295
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,895
Glenn told you?

296
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,315
What did you expect?
The boy has no guile.

297
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,735
I haven't told Rick.

298
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,738
I can't.

299
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,408
Because of Shane?

300
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,743
Was it that obvious?

301
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,078
No, no, I don't
think anyone knew.

302
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,956
I didn't, not for sure.

303
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,751
Look, I thought
my husband was dead.

304
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,589
And I felt like
I'd died with him.

305
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,424
And I--

306
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,510
I wanted to feel
something-- anything.

307
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,681
And now I hate myself for it.

308
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,225
And the baby?

309
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,227
It's Rick's.

310
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,605
None of the rest
of it matters.

311
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,608
Then what's your concern?

312
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,110
Memories are
what keep me going now.

313
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,947
Memories of what life
used to be.

314
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,949
And I--

315
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,825
I've got a deep well
to draw on.

316
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,661
I still remember joy.

317
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,622
But I think Carl's well
is already running dry.

318
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,540
And this baby--

319
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,376
the baby won't have
any good memories at all,

320
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,962
only fear and pain.

321
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,464
You can't think like that.

322
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,550
We can still find joy

323
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,804
and we can still take
strength from each other.

324
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,098
Do you really think
this baby has a chance,

325
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,309
that it could grow up
and live a happy life?

326
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,812
Look me in the eye
and tell me

327
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,357
that my baby will grow up
to be your age

328
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,735
and die happy.

329
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:04,948
Tell me.
Tell me you believe that.

330
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,301
I'm sorry. I'm-- it just came out.
And it was Dale.

331
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,346
It's okay. I never should have
put you in that position.

332
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,808
I've been thinking
about what you said

333
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,893
about needing help.

334
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,146
And you're right that I do.

335
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,981
Name it. Yeah.

336
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,983
If you're still willing to make
a run into town for me...

337
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,568
I'm your man.

338
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,529
Thank you.

339
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,408
It's okay.
It's not a big deal really.

340
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,542
You didn't have to come.

341
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,295
You could hate me
from a distance.

342
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,383
Please say something.

343
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,518
- Maggie, I--
- I asked for your trust

344
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:19,230
and you betrayed it.
Now my dad's pissed at me.

345
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,068
Your turn.

346
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,324
So your dad thinks
they're sick?

347
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,076
You agree with that,

348
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,912
even after what you saw
at the well?

349
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,914
I'm not sure what I saw
at the well.

350
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,083
Yes, you are.

351
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,379
Look, if you'd seen Atlanta,

352
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,215
you would not have
a barn full of walkers.

353
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,425
I wish you'd stop
calling them that.

354
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,596
What do you call them?

355
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,598
Mom,

356
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,433
Shawn,

357
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:59,270
Mr. and Mrs. Fischer,
Lacey, Duncan.

358
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,737
What does she want now?

359
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,405
I can't say.

360
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,538
So when one of them asks you
to keep your mouth shut...

361
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,375
Crawl out of my butt

362
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:22,544
and help me look, please.

363
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,551
You've got to be kidding me.

364
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,178
Help!

365
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,638
Glenn, help!

366
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,265
Oh, God!

367
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,518
- Maggie!
- Glenn, help me!

368
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,314
Help! Glenn!

369
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,192
Get it off me!
Help!

370
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,577
Did it get you?
Did it bite you?

371
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,042
Glenn!

372
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,026
We're gonna have to go
house to house.

373
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,779
We'll start at the far end
and we'll work our way back.

374
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,573
If Sophia got this far,
she has a real shot,

375
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,242
don't you think?

376
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,497
Hey! We got your stuff.

377
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,499
Maggie, hang on, please.

378
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,669
- Come on in here.
- Why? Nothing to hide.

379
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,129
We got your
special delivery right here.

380
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,506
We got your lotion,
got your conditioner,

381
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,883
- your "Soap Opera Digest."
- Maggie.

382
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,635
Next time you want something,
get it your damn self.

383
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,179
- We're not your errand boys.
- Honey, I--

384
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,017
And here's your
abortion pills.

385
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,701
- That was not cool.
- Which part?

386
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,287
The part where that bitch
almost got us killed?

387
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,915
I should've gone alone.

388
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,709
If you want to blame
anybody, blame me.

389
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,919
Right, take the blame.

390
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,922
You know, for a smart guy,
you're really stupid.

391
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,009
Okay, I'm confused,

392
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,803
because I think you just paid me
a compliment, but you made it s--

393
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,563
I've already lost
three of the people

394
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,106
that I care about most
in this world.

395
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,192
- Maggie--
- Shut up.

396
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,819
You're smart.
You're brave.

397
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,988
You're a leader.
But you don't know it.

398
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,573
And your friends
don't want to know it.

399
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,076
They'd rather have you
fetching peaches.

400
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,620
There's a dead guy in the well?
Send Glenn down.

401
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,372
You're walker bait.

402
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,541
I can't take you
becoming one of them.

403
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,387
Sophia?

404
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,222
Anyone?

405
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,140
Shh, shh, shh.

406
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,688
Sophia?

407
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,537
They walled off
the hallway?

408
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,124
They tried
to make a stand here.

409
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,147
Sophia?

410
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,389
She was never here,

411
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,558
was she?

412
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,146
I don't know how to tell Carol
this was another dead end.

413
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,275
Come on, let's move.

414
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,785
Cover that street.
I'll clear the car.

415
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,759
Oh, shit.

416
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,059
Focus now.
Clear the jam. Focus.

417
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,949
- Are you kidding me?
- I got your back. Now go.

418
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,630
Andrea, Andrea, let's go.

419
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,507
Come on.

420
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,556
Andrea, come on.

421
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,572
The blood
on Maggie's shirt--

422
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,907
She was attacked.

423
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,784
Are you guys all right?
How bad was it?

424
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,870
It was pretty close.

425
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,414
I'm so sorry.

426
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,249
I should never have
asked you to go.

427
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,167
I offered.

428
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,878
I thought the town was safe,
but if you hadn't come back--

429
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,673
But we did.
I always do.

430
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,098
The morning-after pills--
will they even work?

431
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,475
I don't know.

432
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,562
I don't know
if I want them to.

433
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,231
Then I got these, too,

434
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,400
just in case.

435
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,576
Prenatal vitamins.

436
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,414
That's a hell of a choice.

437
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,666
I'm glad it's not mine.

438
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,716
Lori, we're friends,
aren't we?

439
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,303
With everything
we've been through, yeah.

440
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,430
I can't tell you
what to do.

441
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,308
I could never tell you
something like that.

442
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,980
But your choice--

443
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,317
maybe you shouldn't
make it alone.

444
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,850
Come on, then.

445
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,187
Get over here.
Get over here.

446
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,109
Anything?

447
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,570
Not today.

448
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,113
I'm so sorry.

449
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,115
We'll cover
more ground tomorrow.

450
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,703
What happened out there?

451
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,623
Um, I--

452
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,708
- The place was overrun.
- Yeah.

453
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,005
Let's go get you cleaned up.

454
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,433
- Shane, Shane.
- Hmm?

455
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,560
I was thinking,

456
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,437
you've got that
nice new ride of yours,

457
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,607
plenty of fuel, more than enough
for you to get far from here.

458
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,609
What, you telling me
to leave?

459
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,444
I know you've been
planning to.

460
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,696
Maybe now is a good time.

461
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,990
Is this about Andrea?

462
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,327
I'm looking out
for the group.

463
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,163
You think the group would be
better off without me, Dale?

464
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,582
Why don't you tell that
to Rick or Lori?

465
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,085
Their boy would be dead
if I hadn't put my ass on the line.

466
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,461
And Otis's.

467
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,591
You've been vague about that night,
about what happened.

468
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,639
Otis died a hero.

469
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,182
So you've said.

470
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,768
A little boy lived because of what
went down that night.

471
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,271
I think you ought
to show some gratitude.

472
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,481
- I wasn't there.
- No, man, you weren't.

473
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,984
But I was the time that you
raised your gun on Rick.

474
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,611
- Come on. Jesus.
- You had him in your sights

475
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,280
and you held him there.

476
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,370
I know what kind of man
you are.

477
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,377
You think I'd shoot Rick?

478
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,839
That is my best friend.

479
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,674
That's the man that I love.

480
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,051
I love him like
he's my brother.

481
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,554
You think that's
the kind of man I am?

482
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,055
That's right.

483
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,182
Well, maybe we ought
to just think that through.

484
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,184
Say I'm the kind of man

485
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,729
who'd gun down
his own best friend.

486
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,857
What do you think I'd do
to some guy that I don't even like

487
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,443
when he starts throwing
accusations my way?

488
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,612
What do you think?

489
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,598
Is there something
you need to tell me?

490
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,227
We can't leave.
I'm pregnant.

491
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,479
Are you?

492
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,816
I threw them up.

493
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,616
You can yell if you want.

494
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,911
You can scream
if you have to,

495
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,080
but talk to me.

496
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,459
How long have you known?

497
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,337
Does it matter?

498
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:06,593
Days? Weeks?
And you didn't tell me?

499
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,429
- I'm telling you now.
- No.

500
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,641
I found these.
So Glenn knows, right?

501
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,311
Instead of coming to me,
you sent him to get pills?

502
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,440
I panicked. You tell me we have
no roof and no walls--

503
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,317
Do not put this on me!

504
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,404
You tear into me for keeping secrets
when you're holding onto this?

505
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,406
You want me to bring
a baby into this?

506
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,658
To live a short,
cruel life?

507
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,702
How can you think
like that?

508
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,121
We can't even protect
the son we already have.

509
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,498
So this is the solution?

510
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,043
Rick, I threw them up.

511
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,046
I screwed up.

512
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,842
I don't know
how we do this.

513
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,399
We can make it work.

514
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:06,070
How? Tell me how.

515
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:10,074
We'll figure it out.
Shouldn't we try to figure it out?

516
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,243
You threw up the pills.

517
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,496
You want this baby.
I know you do.

518
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,372
Not like this.

519
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,917
Not giving birth
in a ditch.

520
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,378
Not when its life
will hang by a thread

521
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,547
from the second it's born.

522
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,133
Not when every cry
will put it,

523
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,053
and Carl, and everyone
we care about, into danger.

524
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,596
That's not right.

525
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,766
Not even giving it a chance
isn't right either.

526
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,518
Maybe this is why
I didn't want to tell you.

527
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,396
I still-- I still
don't understand why.

528
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:45,442
You really think I'd make you
have a baby you don't want?

529
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,821
No, so that if I
went through with it,

530
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,116
it would be on my
conscience and not yours.

531
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,745
Maybe that's true,

532
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,623
but I can't live
like this anymore,

533
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,876
Lori.

534
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,754
We can't live like this.

535
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,758
Is there anything else

536
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,177
I should know about?

537
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,105
Shane and I.

538
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:33,740
I know.
Of course I know.

539
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,209
You thought I was dead.

540
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,757
The world went to shit
and you thought I was dead.

541
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,968
Right?

542
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,688
Yeah.
