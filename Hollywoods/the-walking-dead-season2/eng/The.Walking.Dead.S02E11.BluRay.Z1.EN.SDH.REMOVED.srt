1
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,356
- I told you--
- You ain't told me shit!

2
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,860
I barely knew those guys.
I met 'em on the road.

3
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,029
How many in your group?

4
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,577
Uh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

5
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,287
Come on, man.

6
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,956
- Ah!
- How many?!

7
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,291
Uh, 30.
30. 30 guys.

8
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,751
- Where?
- Uh...

9
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,463
I don't know. I swear.

10
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,382
We were never anyplace
more than a night.

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,093
Scouting?
Planning on staying local?

12
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,554
I don't know.
They left me behind.

13
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,056
- Did you ever pick off a scab?
- Come on, man!

14
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,808
I'm trying to cooperate.

15
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,935
Start real slow at first.

16
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,687
Sooner or later,
you've just gotta rip it off.

17
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,897
Okay. Okay.

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,983
They have weapons--

19
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,235
heavy stuff, automatics.

20
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,530
But I didn't do anything.

21
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,742
Your boys shot at my boys,
tried to take this farm.

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,285
You just went along for the ride?

23
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:18,703
You're trying to tell me
you're innocent?

24
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,122
Yes!

25
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,332
These-- these people
took me in.

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,502
Not just guys--
a whole group of 'em.

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,463
Men and women,

28
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,715
kids, too--
just like you people.

29
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,426
Thought I'd have a better chance
with them, you know?

30
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,969
But...

31
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,347
we go out, scavenge--

32
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,433
just the men.

33
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,104
One night we-- we found
this little campsite.

34
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,815
A man and his
two daughters--

35
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,567
teenagers, you know?

36
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,196
Real young.
Real cute.

37
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,498
Their daddy had to watch
while these guys, they--

38
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,251
And they didn't
even kill him afterwards.

39
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,129
They just--
they just made him watch

40
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,672
as his daughters--

41
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,802
They just-just--
just left him there.

42
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,807
No, but-but--
but I didn't touch those girls.

43
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,558
No, I swear
I didn't to--

44
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,561
Please.

45
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,606
Please.
You gotta believe me, man.

46
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,858
I'm not like that.

47
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,986
I ain't like that.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,739
Please. Please,
you gotta believe me.

49
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,990
So what you gonna do?

50
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,950
We'd all feel better
if we knew the plan.

51
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,161
- Is there a plan?
- We gonna keep him here?

52
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,333
We'll know soon enough.

53
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,300
Boy there's got
a gang, 30 men.

54
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,595
They got heavy artillery and they
ain't looking to make friends.

55
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,265
They roll through here,
our boys are dead.

56
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,101
And our women, they're gonna--
they're gonna wish they were.

57
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,020
What did you do?

58
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,731
Had a little chat.

59
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,067
No one goes near this guy.

60
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,987
Rick, what are you gonna do?

61
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,823
We have no choice.
He's a threat.

62
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,201
We have to
eliminate the threat.

63
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,537
You're just gonna kill him?

64
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,457
It's settled.
I'll do it today.

65
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,670
You can't do this.

66
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,714
You don't wanna do this.
I know you don't.

67
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,341
I thought about it
all night.

68
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,509
Knowing what we know now,
I don't see a way out of it.

69
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,137
But you can't just decide on your
own to take someone's life.

70
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,389
The group seemed supportive.

71
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,100
Because they didn't speak back?
You didn't let 'em.

72
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,773
There's gotta be a process.

73
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,982
And what would that be?

74
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,901
We can't call witnesses,
go before a judge.

75
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,903
So he's automatically
guilty by association

76
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,905
and sentenced to death?

77
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,740
He's just a kid.

78
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,702
Give me some time
to talk to everyone.

79
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,955
- Try to figure out another way--
- No, we can't drag this out.

80
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,373
People are scared.

81
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,166
Which is why they need time
to discuss this.

82
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,251
No, no, no,
they need to be safe.

83
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,296
- I owe 'em that.
- You think about your son.

84
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,466
The message that
you're giving him--

85
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,218
shoot first, think later.

86
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,264
I'm asking for one day
to talk to everybody.

87
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,601
You can give me that.
Think about Carl.

88
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,478
I am.

89
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,902
We reconvene at sunset,
then what happens happens.

90
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,040
- I need a favor.
- Did you move the gun bag?

91
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,001
Yeah.

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,884
I need you to guard Randall,

93
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,678
protect him.

94
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,346
Why?

95
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,598
Rick's giving me time
to talk to the others,

96
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,308
try and talk
some sense into them.

97
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,394
But if Shane finds out--

98
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,229
You think he'll just shoot
the guy himself?

99
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,190
You know killing the boy
had to be his idea.

100
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,110
Are you with him on this?

101
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,282
He's a threat.
Tell me this isn't all the ammo.

102
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,077
You're a Civil Rights lawyer.

103
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,495
Was.

104
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,749
You fight with words,
the power of ideas.

105
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,585
Using a gun,
that's his way.

106
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,463
You really want to debate
about saving a guy

107
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,882
who will lead his buddies
right to our door?

108
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,842
That's what
a civilized society does.

109
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,552
Who says
we're civilized anymore?

110
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,431
No, the world
we knew is gone,

111
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,392
but keeping
our humanity?

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,770
That's a choice.

113
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,282
I'll watch your prisoner.

114
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,619
But not because
I think you're right.

115
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,844
Hello?

116
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,639
Hey.

117
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,474
Can I get some water?

118
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,684
Please?

119
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,146
I'm very thirsty.

120
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,034
They're gonna
kill me, right?

121
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,127
So he's a kid?

122
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,677
He ain't a kid.

123
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,595
That was a figure of speech.

124
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,514
- Can I see him?
- No.

125
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,560
Look, man, this is--
this is grown-up stuff, all right?

126
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,980
You just-- you just
let us handle this.

127
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,869
Dale, huh?

128
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,912
What, he put you
on death watch?

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,957
Let me ask you something--
say I wanted to go in there right now

130
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,043
and I just wanted to take care of this,
you gonna stop me?

131
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,879
I had a good teacher.

132
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,547
Yeah.

133
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,632
So what...

134
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,887
you buy
into Dale's sob story?

135
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,889
I told him I was
with you on this.

136
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,933
Mmm. You're just
still here for him, huh?

137
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,728
That's cute.

138
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,938
You see what's happening,
don't you?

139
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,441
These guys ain't gonna
go through with this.

140
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,276
I'm telling you,
they gonna--

141
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,111
they gonna pussy out.
And if they do,

142
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,946
we gonna have
a big problem on our hands.

143
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,451
Let me ask you something-- every time
we have a problem around here,

144
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,661
- who do you think's behind it?
- Some might say you.

145
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,414
No one listens to me.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,835
I say it's the guys
that make up the rules,

147
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,587
the ones that always have
all the answers,

148
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,631
even though their answers
always prove wrong.

149
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,675
So what are you gonna do?
Rick's the leader of this group.

150
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,969
- It's Hershel's farm.
- Maybe we oughta change that.

151
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,473
What, are you gonna lock 'em in
a room and take their guns?

152
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,438
I don't know.
That could get out of hand.

153
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,440
No, no, it won't. Okay?
I won't let it.

154
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,319
Listen, I don't-- I don't want
anybody to get hurt, okay?

155
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,364
Rick's my friend, Hershel--
he's all right by me.

156
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,283
- And Dale?
- Dale got a big mouth,

157
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,160
but he's harmless.

158
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,622
Look, I just-- I wanna know
what it's like to sleep

159
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,374
without keeping
one eye open.

160
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,668
Ain't that--
ain't that what we all want?

161
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,464
The ball's in their court.
Maybe I'm wrong.

162
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,675
Maybe I'm getting
all worked up over nothing.

163
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,551
Hey.

164
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,807
That's a sweet hat.

165
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,810
I'm Randall.
What's your name?

166
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,814
The sheriff guy--
that your dad?

167
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,482
I like him.

168
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,402
Yeah, he's a good guy.
I can tell.

169
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,072
Your mom out here, too?

170
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,493
You're-- you're lucky
you still got your family.

171
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,161
I lost mine.

172
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,832
Hey, I-- I don't know what people
have been saying about me,

173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,002
but I didn't do nothing.
I swear.

174
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,922
Your dad was gonna let me go till
his friend started fighting with him.

175
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,846
It got pretty bad.
I was kinda worried.

176
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,016
My camp,
we got lots of supplies.

177
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,936
You help me, I'll take you and your
folks back to my people.

178
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,689
We'll take good care of you.

179
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,858
Keep you safe.
You just got to--

180
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,193
just got to help me
get out of here, okay?

181
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,573
Just help me pick these locks
or find the key, okay?

182
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,200
Come on, please?
Please?

183
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,204
What the hell are you doing in here?
What did you say to him?

184
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,749
- What did you say to him, huh?
- I didn't say nothing.

185
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,126
- I will shoot you where you sit.
- Okay, Shane, not now.

186
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,836
- Open your mouth.
- Shane.

187
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,713
You like talking, man?
You like talking?!

188
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,298
Back off!

189
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,388
Get your ass out this door.
Let's go.

190
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,891
- What the hell you doing?
- Please don't tell my parents.

191
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,311
Carl, that ain't cool, man.
You could've gotten hurt in there.

192
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,480
- I can handle myself.
- Let me tell you something--

193
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,066
you do not go near him again.
Do you hear me?

194
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,734
Damn it.

195
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,861
You won't tell
my parents, will you?

196
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,571
Carl, man,

197
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,656
it ain't about getting
in trouble, okay?

198
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,241
A guy like that,
he will say anything to you.

199
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,452
He'll try to make you
feel sorry for him.

200
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,579
He'll try to make you
get your guard down.

201
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,623
You let your guard down
out here, people die.

202
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,666
Now, just--

203
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,878
do me a favor, man.
Go find your ma. Go on.

204
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,634
Carl, quit trying
to get yourself killed, man.

205
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,990
Oh! The whole point
of me coming up here

206
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,035
- is to get away from you people.
- Gonna take more than that.

207
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,288
Carol send you?

208
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,499
Carol's not the only one
that's concerned about you,

209
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,709
your new role in the group.

210
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,337
Oh, man, I don't need
my head shrunk.

211
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,631
This group's broken.

212
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,843
I'm better off
fending for myself.

213
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,388
- You act like you don't care.
- Yeah, it's 'cause I don't.

214
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,435
So live or die, you don't care
what happens to Randall?

215
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,479
- Nope.
- Then why not stand with me,

216
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,566
try to save the kid's life, if it really
doesn't matter one way or the other?

217
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,235
Didn't peg you
for a desperate son of a bitch.

218
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,904
Your opinion makes
a difference.

219
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,865
Man, ain't nobody looking
at me for nothing.

220
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:07,661
Carol is, and I am.
Right now.

221
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,621
And you obviously--
you have Rick's ear.

222
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,167
Rick just looks to Shane.
Let him.

223
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,504
You cared about
what happened to Sophia...

224
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,508
cared what
it meant to the group.

225
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,180
Torturing people?
That isn't you.

226
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,016
You're a decent man.

227
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,101
So is Rick.

228
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,314
Shane is different.

229
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,525
Why's that?
'Cause he killed Otis?

230
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,155
- He tell you that?
- He told some story--

231
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,325
how Otis covered him,
saved his ass.

232
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,535
He showed up
with the dead guy's gun.

233
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,705
Rick ain't stupid.

234
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,041
If he didn't figure that out,
it's 'cause he didn't wanna.

235
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,753
It's like I said--
group's broken.

236
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,225
Baby, where's your daddy?

237
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,394
- He's up there.
- All right.

238
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,704
So...

239
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,916
the nights are getting colder
and we're pretty exposed.

240
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,418
- I was thinking--
- Maybe we could clear this place out,

241
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,922
station lookouts up here.

242
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,218
- Uh...
- Or we could talk to Hershel

243
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,886
about staying
in the house.

244
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,097
- Yeah.
- All right.

245
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,269
Is that really
the best way to do this?

246
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,772
To string him up?

247
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,440
I have no idea.

248
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,609
It's my first time.

249
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,574
Look, I know how you feel
about the death penalty, but--

250
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,993
And I know
the world has changed.

251
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,786
After everything
that's happened,

252
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,955
you and Shane agree on this.

253
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,957
So you support
this decision?

254
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,210
If you think it's best.

255
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,970
You never did tell me what happened
on the road with you and Shane.

256
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,141
He won't be
a problem anymore.

257
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,068
You know, we'll see Sophia
again in heaven some day.

258
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,951
She's in a better place.

259
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,954
No, she's not.

260
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,624
Heaven is
just another lie.

261
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,835
And if you believe it,
you're an idiot.

262
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,348
You need to
control that boy.

263
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,392
- Carl? What happened?
- He's disrespectful.

264
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,354
- Did he say something?
- Something cruel about Sophia.

265
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,773
- We'll figure it out. It's okay.
- It's not okay.

266
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,192
I'll have--
I'll have a talk with him.

267
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,445
See? We'll-- we'll--

268
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,697
we'll deal with it.
If you can calm down, so that I can--

269
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,991
- Don't tell me to calm down!
- No, I-- I don't--

270
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,286
I don't need you to patronize me.
Everyone either avoids me

271
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,330
or they treat me
like I'm crazy.

272
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,208
I lost my daughter.
I didn't lose my mind!

273
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,465
Carl, come over here.

274
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,551
Did you talk back
to Carol?

275
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,012
- No.
- She says you did.

276
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,057
You can't talk back
to people like that.

277
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,478
I said it's stupid
to believe in heaven.

278
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,356
'Cause it is.

279
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,984
Well, just think
about that for a minute.

280
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,320
She just lost
her daughter.

281
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,281
She wants to believe
she's still alive in some way.

282
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,908
- But she--
- Don't.

283
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,828
Don't talk.
Think.

284
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,248
It's a good
rule of thumb for life.

285
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,166
Mom always wants you
to talk more.

286
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,918
Don't change
the subject.

287
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,212
You owe Carol an apology.

288
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,006
You made a mistake.
Fix it.

289
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,176
Is that why you're
gonna kill that guy?

290
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,722
Fixing your mistake?

291
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,932
That's different.

292
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,520
How are you gonna do it?
Are you gonna hang him in the barn?

293
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,690
You just think about how you're
gonna make things right with Carol.

294
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,901
Don't talk. Think.

295
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,363
- You got it?
- Yeah.

296
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,948
What happened?

297
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,659
A dozen steer busted
through the fence.

298
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,787
Been wrangling
the runaways all morning.

299
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,457
But you're not here
to talk cattle.

300
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,710
- The boy.
- The prisoner.

301
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,713
- Randall.
- I don't want to know.

302
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,549
I'm told they're
deciding his fate.

303
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,010
I'll leave it with Rick.

304
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,179
But this is your home.

305
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,723
I want him away
from my girls.

306
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,683
I don't care how.

307
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,061
- It's an execution.
- I don't want to know.

308
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,647
But you can't stand
by the sidelines.

309
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,816
You're a man
with convictions.

310
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,860
To tell you
the truth, I was.

311
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,862
Or at least
I thought I was.

312
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,573
But I've made
too many mistakes.

313
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,287
Would you at least talk with Randall
before making up your mind?

314
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,625
No. I'll leave it with Rick.

315
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,095
What's up, Dale?

316
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,601
I want to change
your mind.

317
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,604
What, you serious?

318
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:58,233
I know you and I will never see
eye to eye on much.

319
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,193
I'd say that's the understatement
of the year, huh?

320
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,987
But...

321
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,365
- you're not going anywhere.
- No.

322
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,285
- And I'm not going anywhere.
- Okay.

323
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,998
So let's talk
about this like men.

324
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,959
Okay.

325
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,378
You deny
we're in danger, Dale?

326
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,922
No, but there's
a dozen of us,

327
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,174
one of him.

328
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,177
- There's 30 of them.
- Killing him doesn't change that.

329
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,223
- No.
- But it changes us.

330
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,105
You got balls, Dale.

331
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,815
I'm gonna give you that.

332
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,692
Now...

333
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,071
I'll tell you what--
in a little bit when y'all gather,

334
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,198
you're gonna talk
about this.

335
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:51,119
If you've convinced them
to keep this guy alive,

336
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,039
I ain't gonna say
a damn word about it, okay?

337
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,292
But I'm telling you now,
man to man,

338
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,169
you're wrong.

339
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,963
And when this guy
kills somebody

340
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,673
I ain't gonna need
to say anything,

341
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,926
because that blood--
that's gonna be on you.

342
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,098
You're wrong about this, Dale.
You're dead wrong.

343
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,853
Go back home.

344
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,315
Doodlebug, Doodlebug,
go away home.

345
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,276
- Doodlebug.
- Doodlebug, Doodlebug, go away home.

346
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,573
How is she?

347
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,159
She seems to be in
good spirits today.

348
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,453
Aren't you, Doodlebug?

349
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,957
Well, let me know
if I can do anything.

350
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,630
Where's your family from?

351
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,178
Michigan.

352
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:54,057
But before that, Korea.

353
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,353
Immigrants built
this country.

354
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,313
Never forget that.

355
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:03,483
Our family came
from Ireland.

356
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,653
Maggie Greene-- I kinda figured.

357
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:14,369
My grandfather brought this over
from the old country.

358
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:17,622
He passed it on to my father,
who passed it on to me.

359
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,376
I pawned it to pay for a night of
drinking I no longer remember.

360
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:25,130
You bought it back.

361
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,467
My late wife did--
Josephine,

362
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,511
Maggie's mother.

363
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,556
She gave it back
years later

364
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,432
when I sobered up.

365
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,477
She was a good woman,
my Jo.

366
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,440
Maggie's a lot like her.

367
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,821
When we were in that bar
and afterwards,

368
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,948
I thought about
a lot of things.

369
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,993
You become a father someday,
you'll understand.

370
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,371
No man is good enough
for your little girl...

371
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,500
until one is.

372
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,719
Go on now, before I change
my mind about you.

373
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,517
Thanks.

374
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,532
It's almost time.

375
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,869
I know this isn't
easy for you.

376
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,913
It isn't easy for anyone.

377
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,666
But I thought it through.

378
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,336
I made the call.

379
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,796
I'm ready to do this.

380
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,382
You don't have to
be the one to do it--

381
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,302
- Shane, Daryl.
- Yeah, yeah, it has to be me.

382
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,639
I brought him back here.
Maybe I shouldn't have.

383
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,515
I gotta keep
these people safe.

384
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,184
That is what
I'm gonna do.

385
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,144
What about Dale?

386
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,521
He's got an uphill battle.

387
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,569
- You said you support me.
- I do.

388
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,699
But you didn't say
you think I'm making the right call.

389
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,960
This is the right call.

390
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,544
Let's gather up.

391
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,880
Come on, Carl.
I want you to stay with Jimmy.

392
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,507
But I want to listen.

393
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,885
Hm-mmm, not this time.
Come on.

394
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,702
So how do we do this?
Just take a vote?

395
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,081
- Does it have to be unanimous?
- How about majority rules?

396
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,291
Well, let's just see where
everybody stands

397
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,086
then we can talk
through the options.

398
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,547
The way I see it, there's only
one way to move forward.

399
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,385
Killing him, right?

400
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,512
I mean, why even bother
to take a vote?

401
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,222
It's clear which way
the wind's blowing.

402
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,392
Well, if people believe we should
spare him, I want to know.

403
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,436
Well, I can tell you
it's a small group--

404
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,106
maybe just me and Glenn.

405
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:02,740
Look, I think you're pretty
much right about everything,

406
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,743
- all the time, but this--
- They've got you scared.

407
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,329
He's not one of us.

408
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,332
And we've-- we've lost
too many people already.

409
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,463
How about you?
Do you agree with this?

410
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,883
Couldn't we continue
keeping him prisoner?

411
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,636
Just another mouth to feed.

412
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,680
It may be a lean winter.

413
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:29,142
- We could ration better.
- Well, he could be an asset.

414
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,686
Give him a chance
to prove himself.

415
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,480
- Put him to work?
- We're not letting him walk around.

416
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:35,815
We could put
an escort on him.

417
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,775
Who wants to volunteer
for that duty?

418
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,068
I will.

419
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,154
I don't think any of us should be
walking around with this guy.

420
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,365
He's right. I wouldn't feel safe
unless he was tied up.

421
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,492
We can't exactly put chains around
his ankles,

422
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,119
sentence him
to hard labor.

423
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:52,165
Look, say we let him
join us, right?

424
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,293
Maybe he's helpful,
maybe he's nice.

425
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,628
We let our guard down
and maybe he runs off,

426
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,964
brings back his 30 men.

427
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,341
So the answer is to kill him

428
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,304
to prevent a crime that
he may never even attempt?

429
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:10,224
If we do this,
we're saying there's no hope.

430
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,311
Rule of law is dead.
There is no civilization.

431
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,396
Oh, my God.

432
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,357
Could you drive him
further out?

433
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,109
Leave him
like you planned?

434
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,070
You barely
came back this time.

435
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,157
There are walkers.
You could break down.

436
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,160
- You could get lost.
- Or get ambushed.

437
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,038
They're right. We should not put
our own people at risk.

438
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,457
If you go through with it,

439
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,709
how would you do it?

440
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,628
Would he suffer?

441
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,340
We could hang him, right?
Just snap his neck.

442
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,717
I thought about that.

443
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,136
Shooting may be
more humane.

444
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,723
And what about the body?

445
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,683
- Do we bury him?
- Hold on, hold on.

446
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,561
You're talking about this like
it's already decided.

447
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,772
You've been talking all day,
going around in circles.

448
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,565
You just wanna go around
in circles again?

449
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,567
This is a young man's life

450
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:05,112
and it is worth more than
a five-minute conversation!

451
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,908
Is this what it's come to?

452
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,036
We kill someone because we can't
decide what else to do with him?

453
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,748
You saved him
and now look at us.

454
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:19,001
He's been tortured.
He's gonna be executed.

455
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,091
How are we any better than those
people that we're so afraid of?

456
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,058
We all know
what needs to be done.

457
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,685
No, Dale is right.

458
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,478
We can't leave
any stone unturned here.

459
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,272
- We have a responsibility--
- So what's the other solution?

460
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,439
Let Rick finish.

461
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,568
We haven't come up with
a single viable option yet.

462
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,778
- I wish we could.
- So let's work on it!

463
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,781
- We are.
- Stop it. Just stop it.

464
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,368
I'm sick of everybody
arguing and fighting.

465
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,245
I didn't ask for this.

466
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,039
You can't ask us to decide
something like this.

467
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,043
Please, decide--
either of you, both of you--

468
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,129
but leave me out.

469
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:04,922
Not speaking out

470
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,174
or killing him yourself--

471
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,010
there's no difference.

472
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,304
All right, that's enough.

473
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,056
Anybody who wants the floor

474
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,600
before we make
a final decision

475
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,977
has the chance.

476
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,703
You once said that
we don't kill the living.

477
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,997
Well, that was before
the living tried to kill us.

478
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,957
But don't you see?
If we do this,

479
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,667
the people that we were--

480
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,920
the world
that we knew is dead.

481
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:50,217
And this new world is ugly.
It's... harsh.

482
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,054
It's survival of the fittest.

483
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,349
And that's a world
I don't wanna live in

484
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,643
and I don't believe
that any of you do.

485
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,478
I can't.

486
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,731
Please.

487
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,776
Let's just do what's right.

488
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,868
Isn't there anybody else
who's gonna stand with me?

489
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,297
He's right.

490
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,134
We should try
to find another way.

491
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,513
Anybody else?

492
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,120
Are y'all gonna watch, too?

493
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,832
No, you'll go hide
your heads in your tents

494
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,251
and try to forget that we're
slaughtering a human being.

495
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,920
Whoa.

496
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,548
I won't be a party to it.

497
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,971
This group is broken.

498
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,200
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.

499
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,667
Wait, wait.

500
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,836
- Wait.
- Put him there.

501
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,594
- It's all gonna be over soon.
- Hey. What?

502
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,471
- What's gonna be over soon?
- Relax.

503
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:02,308
- Hey. Hey. No, no, no, no.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

504
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:06,228
- No.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

505
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,148
Oh, no.

506
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,488
Would you like
to stand or kneel?

507
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,782
Oh, no, please.

508
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,701
Ple--

509
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,506
Do you have
any final words?

510
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,303
No. Please.

511
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,014
Please, don't. Don't.

512
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,275
Don't.

513
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,082
Do it, Dad.

514
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,209
Do it.

515
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,508
Are you kidding me?
What did I say to you?

516
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,176
What did I say to you?

517
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,683
Take him away.

518
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,394
Take him away.

519
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,982
Get up.

520
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,692
We're keeping him
in custody for now.

521
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,113
I'm gonna find Dale.

522
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,118
Carl, go inside.

523
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,953
Now, please.

524
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,838
He followed us.

525
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,008
He wanted to watch.

526
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,639
- I couldn't.
- That's okay.

527
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,976
That's okay.

528
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,719
- Get Carl.
- Baby.

529
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,721
- What happened?
- Come here. Come here.

530
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,098
T-Dog, get a shotgun now!

531
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,891
I want you to go in the house
and I want you to lock the door

532
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,727
- and I want you to stay inside.
- Go, Carl, go.

533
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,690
What was that?
What happened?

534
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,066
- What happened?
- I don't know. Go!

535
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,236
No!

536
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,079
Dale!

537
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,025
Help! Over here!

538
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,902
- Where? Where is he?
- Help! Run!

539
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,780
- Hang in there, buddy.
- Who is it?

540
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,615
- Oh, my God.
- Rick!

541
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,450
- Rick!
- Just listen to my voice.

542
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,453
Listen to me, all right?
Just listen to me, all right?

543
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:17,998
Okay, hold on now.
Get Hershel!

544
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,666
He needs blood.
We got to operate now.

545
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,627
Hang on, Dale.
Hang on.

546
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,673
Listen to me.
Come on, just listen to my voice.

547
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,260
All right? Please.
Hershel! We need Hershel!

548
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,805
- Look at me.
- Dale, we're gonna help.

549
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,849
We're here. Just hold on.
Please, hold on.

550
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,643
- What happened?
- What can we do?

551
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,269
Dale, it's gonna be okay.

552
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,316
- Can we move him?
- He won't make the trip.

553
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,609
You have to do
the operation here.

554
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,444
- Glenn, get back to the house.
- Rick.

555
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,572
No!

556
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,575
Oh, God.

557
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,287
Oh, Dale.

558
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,842
Oh, Dale.

559
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,858
He's suffering.

560
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:31,530
Do something!

561
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,202
Come on.

562
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,042
Oh, God.

563
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,489
Sorry, brother.
