1
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,903
Rick, just...

2
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,030
you've got to keep
your strength up.

3
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,617
Lori, did you...

4
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,120
I mean,
it was legendary.

5
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:05,082
Did you ever hear about the time
Shane stole Kingsley's car?

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,627
Yeah.

7
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,545
The principal's car

8
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,422
right out of the teacher's lot

9
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,299
in the middle
of a school day.

10
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,302
Shane steps out of lunch
and makes a beeline

11
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,096
to Kingsley's Hyundai...

12
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,600
wires the ignition, peels out,
drives down Dylan Drive

13
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,101
to that chicken farm
out there.

14
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,813
You've heard
this before, right?

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,608
So he pulls it into one
of the big holding pens.

16
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,402
Kingsley, he waxed
that thing every month;

17
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,781
had the auto shop
vacuum it out every week.

18
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,826
Shane, he parks it
in this huge pen

19
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,119
with a couple of hundred
Rhode Island reds.

20
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,997
He busts open bags of seed
in the back seat,

21
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,333
rolls down all the windows,

22
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,086
and then starts sprinting
back to school.

23
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:53,589
It's three miles away easy.

24
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,260
He's back in time to finish
his sandwich before the bell.

25
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,762
And then the bell rings.

26
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,683
Shane gets up and when he runs
into Kingsley in the hallway

27
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,143
he looks out the window
and says,

28
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,105
"Principal Kingsley,

29
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,275
your coupe's gone."

30
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,488
Coupe, like chicken coop.

31
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,615
I get it.

32
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,993
Of course you do.

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,997
You've heard this story
1,000 times.

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,210
What you said before,
you're right.

35
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,590
Shane's gonna make it back
with what the doctor needs.

36
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,757
He'll make it back.

37
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,094
Hershel said
you need to eat.

38
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:44,015
Carl's gonna be all right.

39
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,812
Please, for me.

40
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,190
You've got to keep
your strength up.

41
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,591
I need my clip now.

42
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,892
I'm gonna walk the road,
look for the girl.

43
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,329
I'm coming, too.

44
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,166
I'm going for a walk.
Shine some light in the forest.

45
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,002
If she's out there,
give her something to look at.

46
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,670
Do you think that's
a good idea right now?

47
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,588
Dale.

48
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,479
Those windows,
what's on the other side?

49
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,441
About a 20-foot drop with nothing
to catch you, maybe some bushes,

50
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,985
- then the athletic field.
- We just need enough time.

51
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,237
We got to get up there.
We got to get 'em open and get out.

52
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,531
- Not me. Maybe you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

53
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,242
Come on, man, look at me.
You really think I can squeeze through

54
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,162
one of them tiny windows?
They'd be all over us.

55
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,331
We lay down some fire
to get a head start.

56
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,709
You stay here.
I hop down and draw them away.

57
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,503
That gives you the chance to get up
the bleachers and out a window.

58
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,964
And where do you go?

59
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,716
Locker room
down those steps.

60
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,594
Looks like a good way
to get trapped.

61
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,929
It's got windows too,
and more my size.

62
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,558
I get out through one, I double back,
we meet up out on the field.

63
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,226
You're a crazy son
of a bitch, ain't you?

64
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,729
Just trying to do right
for that boy.

65
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,690
You take three shots
and you go.

66
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,401
After that I fire.
I'll lay down a cover for you.

67
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,653
- I'll get you a lead.
- All right.

68
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,795
Oh, God.

69
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,311
So do we ring the bell?

70
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,396
I mean, it looks like
people live here.

71
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,815
We're past this kind
of stuff, aren't we?

72
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,817
Having to be considerate.

73
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,779
Did you close the gate
up the road when you drove in?

74
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,073
Uh, hi.

75
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,408
Yes, we closed it.

76
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,285
Did the latch and everything.

77
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,582
Hello.
Nice to see you again.

78
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,544
We met before briefly.

79
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,507
Look, we came to help.
There anything we can do?

80
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,598
It's not a bite.
I cut myself pretty bad though.

81
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,600
We'll have it looked at.
I'll tell them you're here.

82
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:06,230
We have some painkillers
and antibiotics.

83
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,233
I already gave him some.
If Carl needs any.

84
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,235
Come on inside.
I'll make you something to eat.

85
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,800
Hey.

86
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,636
Hey.

87
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,683
Um, we're here, okay?

88
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,810
Thank you.

89
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,354
Whatever you need.

90
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,334
They don't get back soon,
we're gonna have a decision to make.

91
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,044
And that is?

92
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,629
Whether to operate on your
boy without the respirator.

93
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,631
- You said that wouldn't work.
- I know.

94
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,303
It's extremely unlikely.
But we can't wait much longer.

95
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,188
You really think
we're gonna find Sophia?

96
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,526
You got that look
on your face

97
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,528
same as everybody else.

98
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,489
What the hell's wrong
with you people?

99
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,325
- We just started looking.
- Well, do you?

100
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,912
It ain't the mountains of Tibet.
It's Georgia.

101
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,498
She could be holed up
in a farmhouse somewhere.

102
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,583
People get lost
and they survive.

103
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,711
- It happens all the time.
- She's only 12.

104
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,922
Hell, I was younger
than her and I got lost.

105
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,883
Nine days in the woods
eating berries,

106
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,052
wiping my ass
with poison oak.

107
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,054
They found you?

108
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,890
My old man was off on
a bender with some waitress.

109
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,768
Merle was doing another
stint in juvie.

110
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,229
Didn't even know
I was gone.

111
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,523
I made my way back though.

112
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,109
Went straight into the kitchen
and made myself a sandwich.

113
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,028
No worse for wear.

114
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,948
Except my ass itched
something awful.

115
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,743
I'm sorry.

116
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,787
I'm sorry, that is
a terrible story.

117
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,252
Only difference is Sophia's
got people looking for her.

118
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,130
I call that an advantage.

119
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,272
Maybe this isn't a world
for children anymore.

120
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,400
Yeah, well,
we have a child.

121
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,735
Carl is here
in this world now.

122
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,404
Maybe he shouldn't be.

123
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,781
Maybe this is how
it's supposed to be.

124
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,619
You can't mean that.

125
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,792
Okay. All right.

126
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,086
I can understand that
thought crossing your mind.

127
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,006
It didn't cross my mind, Rick.
I can't stop thinking it.

128
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,259
Why do we want Carl
to live in this world?

129
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,470
To have this life?

130
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,307
So he can see more people
torn apart in front of him?

131
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,143
So that he can be
hungry and scared

132
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,480
for however long
he has before he...

133
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:39,693
So he can run and run
and run and run

134
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,779
and then even if he
survives, he ends up--

135
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,325
he ends up just another animal

136
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,535
who doesn't know anything
except survival?

137
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,163
If he--

138
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,374
if he dies tonight,

139
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,002
it ends for him.

140
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,005
Tell me why it would
be better another way.

141
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,845
What changed?

142
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,014
What?

143
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,559
Jenner offered us
a way out.

144
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,686
You asked him
to let us keep trying.

145
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,480
You begged him.

146
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,899
"For as long as we can," you said.
What changed?

147
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,526
There was a moment
the other day--

148
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,862
it was just a second,
but I forgot Jacqui was dead.

149
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,281
I turned around,
I wanted to tell her something.

150
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,533
I almost said her name.

151
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,077
It was just a second
and then I remembered.

152
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,913
But then I realized
she didn't have to see any of it.

153
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,418
The highway, the herds,
Sophia, Carl getting shot--

154
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,421
she didn't--

155
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,343
she doesn't have
to be afraid anymore.

156
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,012
Hungry. Angry.

157
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,723
It hasn't stopped
happening, Rick.

158
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,269
It's like we live with a knife at our
throats every second of every day.

159
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,230
But Jacqui doesn't.
Not anymore.

160
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,066
And then...

161
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,404
I thought,
"Maybe Jenner was right."

162
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,910
I don't accept that.

163
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,912
I can't accept that.

164
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,915
That man surrendered.
It doesn't matt--

165
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,627
it doesn't matter
what he said.

166
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,713
None of it.

167
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,383
You really think it would
be better if Carl--

168
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,974
if we just gave up?

169
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:38,478
Tell me why it would
be better the other way.

170
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,442
Please.

171
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,196
Man, I thought
I'd lost you.

172
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,031
That was my last
rifle round.

173
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,075
- Mine too.
- Come on.

174
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,785
Come on.
Come on.

175
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,313
- Where are we?
- Hey, little man.

176
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,733
That's Hershel.

177
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,152
We're in his house.

178
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,404
You had an accident.

179
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,449
- All right?
- It hurts, a lot.

180
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,118
Oh, baby, I know.
I know.

181
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,122
- You should have seen it.
- What?

182
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,458
The deer.

183
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,169
It was so pretty, Mom.

184
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,088
It was so close.

185
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,300
I've never been...

186
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,892
Carl?

187
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,186
What's happening?

188
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,980
Don't. It's a seizure.

189
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,940
If you hold him down,
you could hurt him.

190
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,526
- You can't stop it?
- He has to just go through it.

191
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,715
His brain isn't
getting enough blood.

192
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,593
His pressure is bottoming.
He needs another transfusion.

193
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,221
- Okay, I'm ready.
- If I take any more out of you,

194
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,473
your body could shut down.
You could go into a coma.

195
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,185
- Or cardiac arrest.
- You're wasting time.

196
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,043
Come on, man.
We need a way out.

197
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,382
- Just let me catch my breath.
- Come on.

198
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,249
Can't sleep?

199
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,753
I'm gonna wait for them
to come back.

200
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,340
You can go down and sleep
if you want to.

201
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,427
No, we can
keep watch together.

202
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,641
Which way did they go?

203
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,017
What the hell?

204
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,235
"Got bit. Fever hit.

205
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,821
World gone to shit.
Might as well quit."

206
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,282
Dumbass didn't know enough
to shoot himself in the head.

207
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,619
Turned himself into a big
swinging piece of bait.

208
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,287
And a mess.

209
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,332
You all right?

210
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,001
Trying not to puke.

211
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,004
- Go ahead if you gotta.
- No, I'm fine.

212
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,632
Let's just talk about
something else for a moment.

213
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,718
- How'd you learn to shoot?
- Gotta eat.

214
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,346
That's one thing these walkers
and us have in common.

215
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:50,809
I guess it's the closest
he's been to food since he turned.

216
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,853
Look at him, hanging up there
like a big piñata.

217
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,523
The other geeks came and ate
all the flesh off his legs.

218
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:03,279
I thought we were
changing the subject.

219
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,741
Call that payback for
laughing about my itchy ass.

220
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,577
There wasn't a lot
that came up.

221
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,914
Huh.

222
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,916
Let's head back.

223
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,794
Aren't you gonna...

224
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,213
No.
He ain't hurting nobody.

225
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,632
Ain't gonna waste
an arrow either.

226
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,135
He made his choice.
Opted out.

227
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,679
Let him hang.

228
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,405
You want to live now
or not?

229
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,950
It's just a question.

230
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,915
An answer for an arrow.

231
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,585
- Fair?
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,255
I don't know
if I want to live

233
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,258
or if I have to

234
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,969
or if it's just a habit.

235
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,640
That's not much of an answer.

236
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,523
Waste of an arrow.

237
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:36,873
You don't need to worry.
She's with Daryl.

238
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,542
If something happens,
he can protect her.

239
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,336
You hear what I'm saying?

240
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,297
Sorry, all I heard was
if something happens.

241
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:49,803
You mind keeping watch?

242
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,596
I don't know how
to use that.

243
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,348
I won't be gone long.

244
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,892
If you see anything, call out.

245
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,853
I'm not going far.
I'll hear you.

246
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,784
You got here
right in time.

247
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,495
This couldn't go
untreated much longer.

248
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,084
"Merle Dixon."

249
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,920
Is that your friend
with the antibiotics?

250
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,256
No, ma'am.
Merle's no longer with us.

251
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,675
Daryl gave us those--
his brother.

252
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,552
Not sure I'd call
him a friend.

253
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,555
He is today. This doxycycline
might have just saved your life.

254
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,099
You know what Merle
was taking it for?

255
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,976
The clap.

256
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,937
Um, venereal disease.

257
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,022
That's what Daryl said.

258
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,276
I'd say Merle Dixon's clap was the best
thing to ever happen to you.

259
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,695
I'm really trying
not to think about that.

260
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,723
Are you praying?

261
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,312
Why do you sneak up
on people so much?

262
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,731
You're easy to sneak up on.

263
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,234
I was praying.

264
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,570
I was trying to.

265
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,156
You religious?
You pray a lot?

266
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,951
Actually this was
my first try.

267
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,286
Ever?

268
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,206
Wow. Sorry.

269
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,458
I didn't mean to wreck
your first time.

270
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,793
God probably got the gist.

271
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,588
- Praying for what?
- My friends.

272
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,341
Looks like they could all
use a little help right now.

273
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,639
You think--

274
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,642
you think God exists?

275
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,144
I always took it on faith.

276
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,730
Lately I've wondered.

277
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,066
Everything that's happened,

278
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,151
there must have been a lot
of praying going on.

279
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,571
It seems quite a few
went unanswered.

280
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,116
Thanks.
This is really helping.

281
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,744
Sorry.
Go ahead.

282
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,163
Really.

283
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,502
You gonna watch?

284
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,968
I'll get you
a refill instead.

285
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,102
I know it's not my business,

286
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,187
and feel free
to believe in God,

287
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,649
but the thing is you've got
to make it okay somehow

288
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,902
no matter what happens.

289
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,950
Before it happened

290
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,495
we were standing there
in the woods

291
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,999
and this deer

292
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,376
just crossed
right in front of us.

293
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,172
I swear, it just
planted itself there

294
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,592
and looked Carl
right in the eye.

295
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,553
And I looked at Carl

296
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,765
looking at that deer, and that deer
looking right back at Carl.

297
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,683
And that moment just...

298
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,609
slipped away.

299
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,278
It slipped away.

300
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:21,574
That's what he was talking
about when he woke up,

301
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,078
not about getting shot

302
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,789
or what happened
at the church.

303
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,042
He talked about
something beautiful,

304
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,753
something living.

305
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,964
There's still a life for us,

306
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,634
a place maybe like this.

307
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,595
It isn't all death
out there.

308
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,181
It can't be.

309
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,891
We just have to be
strong enough

310
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,436
after everything we've seen
to still believe that.

311
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:54,232
Why is it better for Carl
to live even in this world?

312
00:28:56,527 --> 00:29:00,738
He talked about
the deer, Lori.

313
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,157
He talked about
the deer.

314
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,664
Oh, shit.

315
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,003
Got to get to the street,
double back to the truck.

316
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,423
- Look, we ain't gonna make it, okay?
- Got to try, man.

317
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,716
- Come on, get up.
- You're gonna take these bags

318
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,428
- and you're gonna go.
- I ain't leaving you behind.

319
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,307
Okay.

320
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,354
How many rounds
you got left?

321
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,064
Four. You?

322
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,316
Five and one in the pipe.

323
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,135
He's still losing blood
faster than we can replace it.

324
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,471
And with the swelling
in his abdomen

325
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,514
we can't wait any longer

326
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,641
or he's just going
to slip away.

327
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,269
Now I need to know right now

328
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,313
if you want me to do this,

329
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,107
because I think your boy
is out of time.

330
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,694
You have to make a choice.

331
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,363
- A choice?
- A choice.

332
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,867
You have to tell me
what it is.

333
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,411
You have to
tell me what it is.

334
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,793
We do it.

335
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,846
Okay, get the corner
of that bed.

336
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,556
Let's get the sheets
down, everybody.

337
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,184
Get the IV bag
on the sheet.

338
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:57,188
Okay, on three.

339
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,358
One, two, three.

340
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,712
Rick, Lori,

341
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,048
you may want to step out.

342
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,140
Oh, God.

343
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,768
You stay here with him.

344
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,284
- Carl?
- There's still a chance.

345
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,581
Otis?

346
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,418
No.

347
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,719
We say nothing to Patricia.

348
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,306
Not till after.
I need her.

349
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,660
They kept blocking us
at every turn.

350
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,163
We had nothing left.
We were down to 10 rounds.

351
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,790
Then he said--
he said he'd cover me

352
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,751
and that I should
keep going.

353
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,337
So that's what I did.
I just...

354
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,173
I kept going.
But I--

355
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,803
I looked back and he--

356
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,352
I tried.

357
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,146
He wanted to make it right.

358
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,448
Andrea. Wait.

359
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,409
What do you want, Dale?

360
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,994
To give you this.

361
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,038
I care about you

362
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,041
so I made a choice
for you-- choices.

363
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,962
I know why I did it,
but this is not my gun.

364
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,881
And the choices
that I made for you

365
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,591
were not mine to make.

366
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,934
But I can still ask,

367
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,437
and this is not
to make you guilty

368
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,398
or put me ahead of you,
but I can still ask,

369
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,609
please...

370
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,864
don't make me regret this.

371
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,952
I'll take watch.

372
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,622
So do you forgive me for--

373
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,712
do you forgive me?

374
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,132
I'm trying.

375
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:07,438
I've known Otis
since I was a kid.

376
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:11,150
He's run this farm
since before my mother died.

377
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,412
Who else?

378
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,373
Who'd you lose?

379
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,129
You told me I had
to make it okay somehow.

380
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,175
That's what you've been
trying to do, right?

381
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,385
Which ones?

382
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,268
Stepmother.

383
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:52,024
Stepbrother.

384
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,999
He seems to have
stabilized.

385
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,001
Oh, God.

386
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,348
I don't have words.

387
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,684
I don't either.
Wish I did.

388
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,063
How do I tell Patricia
about Otis?

389
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,403
You go to Carl.

390
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,781
I'll go with Hershel.

391
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,570
Stay.

392
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,778
The bathroom's upstairs.

393
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,948
- I brought you some clothes.
- Thank you.

394
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,742
They won't fit well.
They were Otis's.

395
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,463
How many rounds you got left?

396
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,840
Four. You?

397
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,718
Five and one in the pipe.

398
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,679
Come on.

399
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,024
- Down to my last.
- Me, too.

400
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,237
I'm sorry.

401
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,789
Will you give it-- ah!

402
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,833
Give it!

403
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,175
I'll kill you.

404
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,576
Let go of me!
Let go!
