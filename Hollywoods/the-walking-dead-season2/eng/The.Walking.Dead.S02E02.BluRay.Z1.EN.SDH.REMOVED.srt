1
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,763
And now he wants
a cell phone if you can believe that.

2
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,807
I know that look.

3
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,351
Then you get
really quiet.

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,520
So are you
gonna tell me?

5
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,022
We had a fight this morning.
It got ugly.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,608
- Hurtful.
- I'm sorry, hon.

7
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,318
Men can be jerks.

8
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,737
Thing is, if we're being honest,
he wasn't the asshole.

9
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,572
Ah, gotcha.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,825
He was trying so hard
to be reasonable,

11
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,036
it just pushed my buttons
all the more.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,499
God, I sometimes wish
he would just have it out with me

13
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,501
and blow up,

14
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,336
tell me I'm being a bitch
if that's what I'm being.

15
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,464
Instead he's just so...

16
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,884
- Don't beat yourself up.
- No?

17
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,011
You can't tell me that being pissed
at your husband

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,514
because he doesn't yell at you
is even close to being rational.

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,059
That's one problem
I don't have with Tom.

20
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,019
But you still love him.

21
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,063
Sure I do.
Might as well.

22
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,899
- We're lifers.
- I admire your pragmatism.

23
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,403
You still love Rick?

24
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,031
I've been asking myself
that a lot.

25
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,743
And I think
the answer's yes.

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,078
It's just I'm trying
to remember how that works.

27
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,706
Maybe the only
real problem we have

28
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,374
is we got married
so young.

29
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,966
Excuse me.

30
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,740
Is he alive?

31
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,533
He's in surgery.

32
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,163
How?

33
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,376
There was a radio call that said
that there was two suspects in a car.

34
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,254
But there was a third man.
Somebody screwed up.

35
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,549
I screwed up.

36
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:17,011
I did not see him in time.
Lori, it's my fault.

37
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,306
I don't believe that.

38
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,779
What do I say?

39
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,114
How do I tell my son
his father's been shot?

40
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,534
You don't have to
do it alone.

41
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,621
Okay.

42
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,779
Come on.

43
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,789
Hey, you move, shithead.
Come on, get I said.

44
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,791
How far? How far?!

45
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,710
Another half mile that way.

46
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,253
Hershel.

47
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,839
Talk to Hershel.
He'll help your boy.

48
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,176
Come on.

49
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,219
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go. Come on!

50
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,634
Dad!

51
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,529
- Was he bit?
- Shot.

52
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,280
- By your man.
- Otis?

53
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,449
He said find Hershel.
Is that you?

54
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,785
- Help me. Help my boy.
- Get him inside.

55
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,705
Patricia, I need
my full kit.

56
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,248
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

57
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,542
Painkillers, coagulates--
grab everything.

58
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,378
Clean towels,
sheets, alcohol.

59
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,630
In here.

60
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,301
- Pillowcase.
- Is he alive?

61
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,846
Pillowcase, quick.

62
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,889
Is he alive?

63
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,435
Fold it.
Make a pad.

64
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,187
Put pressure
on the wound.

65
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,155
I've got a heartbeat.

66
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,699
- It's faint.
- I got it, step back.

67
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,243
- Maggie, IV.
- We need some space.

68
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,287
- Your name?
- Rick.

69
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,330
- Rick?
- I'm-- I'm Rick.

70
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,542
Rick, we're gonna do
everything we can, okay?

71
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,462
You need to give us
some room.

72
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,007
Now.

73
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,058
- I'm sorry.
- Move!

74
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,534
He's alive?
He's still alive?

75
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,706
Hey...

76
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,334
okay.

77
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,755
It's okay.

78
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,340
You got blood, man.

79
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,305
Okay.

80
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,725
I'll take it from you.

81
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,728
Where is he?
Where is he? Is he okay?

82
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,156
You know his blood type?

83
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,659
A-positive, same as mine.

84
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,577
That's fortunate.

85
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,163
Don't wander far.
I'm gonna need you.

86
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,957
What happened?

87
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,377
I was tracking a buck.

88
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,254
Bullet went through it.

89
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,922
Went clean through.

90
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,716
The deer slowed
the bullet down,

91
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,053
which certainly saved
his life.

92
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,889
But it did not
go through clean.

93
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,516
It broke up into pieces.

94
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,852
If I can get the bullet
fragments out...

95
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,478
and I'm counting six.

96
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,480
I never saw him,

97
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,067
not until he was
on the ground.

98
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,197
- Lori doesn't know.
- I know.

99
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,743
My wife doesn't know.
My wife doesn't know.

100
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,122
You've got to stay with him.

101
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,588
You still worrying about it?

102
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,798
It was a gunshot.

103
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,466
We all heard it.

104
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,303
Why one?
Why just one gunshot?

105
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,638
- Maybe they took down a walker.
- Please don't patronize me.

106
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,974
You know Rick wouldn't risk
a gunshot to put down one walker.

107
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,309
Or Shane.
They'd do it quietly.

108
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,312
Shouldn't they have caught up
with us by now?

109
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,230
There's nothing we can
do about it anyway.

110
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,191
Can't run around these
woods chasing echoes.

111
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,651
- So what do we do?
- Same as we've been.

112
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,279
Beat the bush for Sophia,
work our way back to the highway.

113
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,574
I'm sure they'll hook up
with us back at the RV.

114
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,044
I'm sorry for what
you're going through.

115
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,005
I know how you feel.

116
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,507
I suppose you do.

117
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,927
Thank you.

118
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:17,264
The thought of her
out here by herself...

119
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,185
it's the not knowing
that's killing me.

120
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,521
I just keep hoping and praying
she doesn't wind up like Amy.

121
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,943
Oh, God.

122
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,862
That's the worst thing
I ever said.

123
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,408
We're all hoping
and praying with you,

124
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,452
for what it's worth.

125
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,206
I'll tell you what it's worth--
not a damn thing.

126
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,708
It's a waste of time
all this hoping and praying.

127
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,045
'Cause we're gonna
locate that little girl,

128
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,547
she's gonna be just fine.

129
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,967
Am I the only one
zen around here?

130
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,385
Good Lord.

131
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,952
We are gonna have quite
a collection of spare parts, I tell ya.

132
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,413
Shouldn't they
be back by now?

133
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,748
It's still light.

134
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,002
Let's not worry just yet.

135
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,630
How are you feeling?

136
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,309
T-Dog?

137
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,770
I asked you how you
were feeling just now.

138
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,189
Please don't blow
that question off.

139
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,067
It really, really hurts.

140
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,028
It's throbbing
something awful.

141
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,780
Oh, let me see.

142
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,541
Ah! Don't--
don't touch it!

143
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,668
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,547
Listen, your veins
are very discolored.

145
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,674
You got a hell
of an infection there.

146
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,551
You could die
from blood poisoning.

147
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,972
Oh, man.

148
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,391
Wouldn't that
be the way?

149
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,851
World gone to hell,

150
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,645
the dead risen up
to eat the living

151
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,856
and Theodore Douglas

152
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,317
gets done in by
a cut on his arm.

153
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,569
Yeah, that would be--
that would be stupid.

154
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,738
I've been saying
since yesterday,

155
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,324
we've got to get you
some antibiotics.

156
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,660
We've been ransacking
these cars the whole time.

157
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,163
I can't believe that we have
not found some ampicillin

158
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,750
or something in the whole place.
Can you?

159
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,878
Seems like
there would be.

160
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,630
That's what I think.

161
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,924
Well,

162
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,176
we, uh--

163
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,011
we haven't been
thorough enough.

164
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,347
So let's look some more.

165
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,189
Why'd I let him
come with us?

166
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,484
I should have sent him
with Lori.

167
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,653
You know,
you start that,

168
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,073
you'll never get that monkey
off your back.

169
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,620
Little girl goes missing,
you look for her.

170
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,998
Simple.

171
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,125
You said call it,
head back.

172
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,501
Doesn't matter
what I said.

173
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,837
Carl got shot because
I wouldn't cut bait.

174
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,672
It should be me in there.

175
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,594
You've been there, partner.

176
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,637
Right?

177
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,183
And you pulled through.
So will he.

178
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,227
Is that why I got out
of that hospital?

179
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,980
Found my family
for it to end here like this?

180
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,608
This some kind
of sick joke?

181
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,568
You stop it.

182
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,154
Just stop.

183
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,658
A little girl
goes missing...

184
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,122
you look for her.
It's plain and simple.

185
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,629
Rick.

186
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,673
He needs blood.

187
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,009
You, hold him down.

188
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,971
- Dad!
- I got him.

189
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,852
Almost there.

190
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,813
Stop! You're killing him!

191
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,398
Rick, do you want
him to live?

192
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,611
He needs blood.

193
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,530
Do it now!

194
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,505
Wait. Wait. Hey.

195
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,049
He just passed out.

196
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,979
One down...

197
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,649
five to go.

198
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,711
Pressure's stable.

199
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,381
Lori needs to be here.

200
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,425
She doesn't even know
what's going on.

201
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,135
I've got to go find her.
Bring her back.

202
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,221
- You can't do that.
- She's his mother.

203
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,056
She needs to know
what's happened.

204
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,558
Her son's lying here shot.

205
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,019
And he's going to need
more blood.

206
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,897
He can't go more than
50 feet from this bed.

207
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,361
Hey. Hey.

208
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,573
- Come on.
- I'm all right.

209
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,783
- I'm all right.
- I got him.

210
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,504
He's stable for now.

211
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,760
Lori has to be here
Shane, she has to know.

212
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,387
Okay, I get that.

213
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,222
I'm gonna handle it.

214
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,099
But you've got
to handle your end.

215
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,435
My-- my end?

216
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,605
Your end is being here
for your son.

217
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,858
Even if he didn't need
your blood to survive,

218
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,944
there is no way I'd ever
let you walk out that door.

219
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,947
Man, I'd break your legs
if you tried.

220
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,532
You know that, right?

221
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,289
If something happened to him
and you weren't here...

222
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,295
if-- if he slipped away

223
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,673
while you were gone,

224
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,384
you would never
forgive yourself for that.

225
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,594
And neither
would Lori, man.

226
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,979
You're right.

227
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,148
When was I ever wrong?

228
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,199
You know, when--

229
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,370
when you were
in that hospital,

230
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,497
the one you were
never supposed to leave,

231
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:24,918
man, you should have
seen Lori.

232
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,173
She was like...

233
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,177
the strength
of that woman...

234
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:38,348
you can't imagine it.

235
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,309
See-- see that's what
you've got to have now.

236
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,439
I mean, Carl--
he needs that from you.

237
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,816
So you wire yourself
tight, my friend.

238
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,318
- Hmm?
- You hear?

239
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,654
You've got the hard part.

240
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,865
Just leave the rest
to me, okay?

241
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,491
- All right.
- All right.

242
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,374
He's out of danger
for the moment.

243
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,627
But I need to remove those
remaining fragments.

244
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,463
How?
You saw how he was.

245
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,840
I know, and that was
the shallowest one.

246
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,301
I need to go deeper
to get the others.

247
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,386
- Oh, man.
- There's more.

248
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,263
Tell me.

249
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,891
His belly's distended,
his pressure is dropping,

250
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,185
which means there's
internal bleeding.

251
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,354
A fragment must have nicked
one of the blood vessels.

252
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,611
I have to open him up,
find the bleeder and stitch it.

253
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,030
And he can't move
while I'm in there--

254
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,656
I mean, at all.

255
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,950
If he reacts
the same as before,

256
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,995
I'll sever an artery
and he'll be dead in minutes.

257
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,001
To even try this,
I have to put him under.

258
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,878
But if I do,

259
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,631
he won't be able
to breathe on his own.

260
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,091
Same bad results.

261
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,763
- What'll it take?
- You need a respirator.

262
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,058
- What else?
- The tube that goes with it,

263
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:06,311
extra surgical supplies,
drapes, sutures.

264
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,438
If you had all that
you could save him?

265
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,107
If I had all that,
I could try.

266
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,777
Nearest hospital went up
in flames a month ago.

267
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,905
- The high school.
- That's what I was thinking.

268
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,157
They set up
a FEMA shelter there.

269
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,076
They would have
everything we need.

270
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,828
Place was overrun
last time I saw it.

271
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,914
You couldn't get near it.
Maybe it's better now.

272
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,293
I said, leave the rest to me.

273
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,255
Is it too late
to take that back?

274
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,215
I hate you going alone.

275
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,716
Come on.

276
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,428
Doc, why don't you do me
a list and draw me a map?

277
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,932
You won't need a map.
I'll take you there.

278
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,477
- Ain't but five miles.
- Otis, no.

279
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,814
Honey, we don't have time for
guesswork and I'm responsible.

280
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,817
I ain't gonna sit here while this fella
takes this on alone.

281
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,572
- I'll be all right.
- Are you sure about this?

282
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,700
You even know what any of the stuff
he's talking about looks like?

283
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,035
- Come to think, no.
- I've been a volunteer EMT.

284
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,787
I do.

285
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,581
We can talk about this
till next Sunday

286
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,082
or we could just
go do it real quick.

287
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,667
I'll take right quick.

288
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,377
I should thank you.

289
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,671
Wait till that boy of yours
is up and around.

290
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,716
Then we'll talk.
I'll gather some things.

291
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,638
Where is she,
your wife?

292
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,815
We'll lose the light
before too long.

293
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,484
- I think we should call it.
- Let's head back.

294
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,570
We'll pick it up
again tomorrow?

295
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,531
Yeah, we'll
find her tomorrow.

296
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,213
Just get what you need
and get out of there.

297
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,300
You stay strong,
all right?

298
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,396
That's a fine weapon, Rick.

299
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,565
I'll bring it back
in good shape.

300
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,252
Only one I got.

301
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,424
Man, this turned into
one strange day.

302
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,594
Didn't it though?

303
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,277
Let's check on your boy.

304
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,620
Found some more batteries,

305
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,542
a bottle of very trendy
pink water,

306
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,671
an excellent new machete,

307
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,674
and I thought Glenn
might like this guitar.

308
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,677
Maybe he plays.

309
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,726
No drugs.
You?

310
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,647
Yeah, ibuprofen and these.

311
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,653
What are we doing?

312
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:47,073
Pulling supplies together.

313
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,325
No, I mean...

314
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,828
what are we doing?

315
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,789
People off in the woods,

316
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,876
they's looking for that
poor girl and we're here.

317
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,170
Why?

318
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,008
'Cause they think
we're the weakest.

319
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,014
What are you, 70?

320
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,225
- 64.
- Uh-huh.

321
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,729
And I'm the one
black guy.

322
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,774
Realize how precarious
that makes my situation?

323
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,568
What the hell
are you talking about?

324
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,365
I'm talking about two good-old-boy
cowboy sheriffs

325
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,534
and a redneck whose brother
cut off his own hand

326
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,369
because I dropped a key.

327
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,707
Who in that scenario you think
is gonna be first to get lynched?

328
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,751
You can't be serious.

329
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,171
Am I-- hey,
am I missing something?

330
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,341
Those cowboys have
done all right by us.

331
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,052
And if I'm not mistaken,
that redneck went out of his way

332
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,597
to save your ass--
more than once.

333
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,058
And don't forget
about Andrea.

334
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,768
Kills her own sister.

335
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,020
She was already dead.

336
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,107
Then wants to
blow herself up.

337
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,485
Yeah, she's all there.

338
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,071
She's having a tough time.
What is wrong with you?

339
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,573
The whole world
is having a tough time.

340
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,243
Damn, man.
Open your eyes.

341
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,994
Look where we are--

342
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,413
- stuck in this mess here!
- Shh!

343
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,545
Let's-- let's just go.

344
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,132
Let's just take the RV.

345
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,885
- You've gone off the deep end.
- I mean it, man.

346
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,680
Why are we on the side
of this road like live bait?

347
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,226
Let's go, you and me.

348
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,772
Let's go
before they get back.

349
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,531
Oh, my God.
You're burning up.

350
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,700
Give me that.

351
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,660
Come on.

352
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,790
Here, take these.

353
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,084
We've got to knock
that fever down.

354
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,463
Here.

355
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,931
Where the hell are they?

356
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,561
How much farther?

357
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,480
Not much.
Maybe 100 yards

358
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,733
as the crow flies.

359
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,652
Too bad we're not crows.

360
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,414
Oh.

361
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,958
Oh!

362
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,591
As the crow flies, my ass.

363
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,347
Andrea?

364
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,859
Help me!

365
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,545
Lori? Lori Grimes?
Whoa.

366
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,714
- I'm Lori.
- Rick sent me.

367
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,049
- You've got to come now.
- What?

368
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,218
There's been an accident.
Carl's been shot.

369
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,471
He's still alive
but you've got to come now.

370
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,098
Rick needs you.
Just come.

371
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We don't know this girl.

372
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,769
You can't get
on that horse.

373
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,397
Rick said you had others on
the highway, that big traffic snarl?

374
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,440
- Uh-huh.
- Backtrack to Fairburn Road.

375
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,359
Two miles down is our farm.
You'll see the mailbox.

376
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,403
The name is Greene.
Hyah!

377
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,998
Shut up.

378
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,930
Shot?
What do you mean shot?

379
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,349
I don't know, Dale.
I wasn't there.

380
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,601
All I know is this chick rode
out of nowhere like Zorro

381
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,021
- on a horse and took Lori.
- You let her?

382
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,731
Climb down out of
my ass, old man.

383
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,483
Rick sent her.
She knew Lori's name and Carl's.

384
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,819
I heard screams.
Was that you?

385
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,571
She got attacked
by a walker.

386
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,824
- It was a close call.
- Andrea, are you all right?

387
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,488
This place is beautiful.

388
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,450
Been in my family
160 years.

389
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,494
I can't believe
how serene it is.

390
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,288
How untouched.
You're lucky.

391
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,208
We weren't
completely unscathed.

392
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,961
We lost friends, neighbors.

393
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,965
The epidemic
took my wife,

394
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,842
my stepson.

395
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,594
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,137
My daughters
were spared.

397
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,681
I'm grateful
to God for that.

398
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,852
These people here,

399
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,230
all we've got left
is each other.

400
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,566
Just hoping we can
ride it out in peace

401
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,693
till there's a cure.

402
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,697
We were at the CDC.

403
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,867
It's gone now.

404
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,828
There is no cure.

405
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,039
I don't believe it.

406
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:13,751
When AIDS came along,
everyone panicked.

407
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,671
One boy in town
came down with it

408
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,799
and some parents pulled
their children from school

409
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,592
so they didn't have
to sit in the same room.

410
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,803
This is a whole
other thing.

411
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,888
That's what
we always say--

412
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,182
- "This one's different."
- Well, this one is.

413
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,395
Mankind's been fighting
plagues from the start.

414
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,356
We get our behinds
kicked for a while

415
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,775
then we bounce back.

416
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,570
It's nature
correcting herself,

417
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,573
restoring some balance.

418
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,410
I wish I could
believe that.

419
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,289
I'm sorry.

420
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,723
My boy.

421
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,311
My baby boy.
Baby boy.

422
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,272
It's okay.

423
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,651
Mama's here.
Mama's here.

424
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,695
You're gonna be okay.

425
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,822
You're gonna
be okay.

426
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,408
We're gonna
make you okay.

427
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,608
Slow. Slow.

428
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,945
- How many transfusions?
- Two.

429
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,698
Only two.

430
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,368
He wanted to do the same for you
when you were in the hospital.

431
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,203
I had to talk him
out of it.

432
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,679
Thank you.

433
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,522
Okay, so I understand,

434
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,567
when Shane gets back
with this other man--

435
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,069
- Otis.
- Otis.

436
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,238
The idiot
who shot my son.

437
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,033
Ma'am, it was an accident.

438
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,409
I'll take that under
advisement later.

439
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,286
For now he's the idiot
who shot our son.

440
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,080
Lori, they're doing everything
they can to make it right.

441
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,167
Okay, as soon as they get back
you can perform this surgery?

442
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,836
I'll certainly
do my best.

443
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,255
Okay. You've done this
procedure before?

444
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,466
Well, yes, in a sense.

445
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,177
In a sense?

446
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,929
Honey, we don't have the luxury
of shopping for a surgeon.

447
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,808
No, I understand that.
But I mean you're a doctor, right?

448
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,645
Yes, ma'am.
Of course.

449
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,856
- A vet.
- A veteran? A combat medic?

450
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,692
A veterinarian.

451
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,623
And you've done this surgery
before on what?

452
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:23,125
Cows? Pigs?

453
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,628
I-- I have--
I have to sit.

454
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,845
Completely in over
your head, aren't you?

455
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,808
Ma'am, aren't we all?

456
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,776
Shh, shh.

457
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:00,413
Okay, let's take a look.

458
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:15,344
You see that big mobile medical
trailer across the way?

459
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,016
That's where
we got to get to?

460
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,519
Yeah.

461
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,108
I won't do it.
We can't just leave.

462
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:33,237
Carol, the group is split.
We're scattered and weak.

463
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,198
What if she comes back
and we're not here?

464
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,242
It could happen.

465
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,369
If Sophia found her way
back and we were gone,

466
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,954
that would be awful.

467
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,956
Okay.

468
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,375
We got to plan for this.

469
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,878
I say tomorrow morning
is soon enough to pull up stakes.

470
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,630
Give us a chance
to rig a big sign,

471
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,883
leave her some supplies.

472
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,926
I'll hold here tonight,
stay with the RV.

473
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,137
If the RV is staying,
I am too.

474
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,973
Thank you.
Thank you both.

475
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,395
I'm in.

476
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,230
Well, if you're all
staying then I'm--

477
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,732
Not you, Glenn.
You're going.

478
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,567
Take Carol's Cherokee.

479
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,236
Me?
Why is it always me?

480
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,072
You have to find this farm,
reconnect with our people

481
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,949
and see what's going on.
But most important,

482
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,411
you have to get T-Dog there.
This is not an option.

483
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,955
That cut has gone
from bad to worse.

484
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,458
He has a very serious
blood infection.

485
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:31,086
Get him to that farm.
See if they have any antibiotics.

486
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,465
Because if not,
T-Dog will die, no joke.

487
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,767
Keep your oily rags off
my brother's motorcycle.

488
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,727
Why'd you wait till now
to say anything?

489
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,437
Got my brother's stash.

490
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,150
Crystal, X.
Don't need that.

491
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,944
Got some kick ass
painkillers.

492
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,490
Oxycycline.

493
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,618
Not the generic stuff neither.
It's first class.

494
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,454
Merle got the clap
on occasion.

495
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,582
Pressure's dropping again.

496
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,292
We can't wait much longer.

497
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,252
Take some more.
Whatever he needs.

498
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,463
- Then I'm gonna go.
- Go? Go where?

499
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,548
He said five miles.
They should be long back by now.

500
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,342
- Something's gone wrong.
- Are you insane?

501
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,469
- You're not going after them.
- Rick, listen to your wife.

502
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,971
If they got into trouble--

503
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,807
You're in no condition
to do anything about it.

504
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,768
You've given too much blood.
You're barely on your feet.

505
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,812
You wouldn't make it
across the yard.

506
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,022
If something happened,
I have to go.

507
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,816
No, your place is here.

508
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,068
If Shane said he'll be
back, he'll be back.

509
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,945
- He's like you that way.
- I can't just sit here.

510
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,905
That's exactly what you do!

511
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,782
If you need
to pray or cry

512
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,784
or tell God he's cruel,
you go right ahead,

513
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,536
but you're not leaving, Rick.

514
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:53,122
Carl needs you-- here.

515
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,750
And I can't do this by myself.

516
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,837
Not this one.

517
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,630
I can't.

518
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,758
I can't.

519
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,472
Is this it?

520
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,975
Yeah, three. Three.

521
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,837
Oh, here.

522
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,840
Endotracheal intubator, baby,

523
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,134
for my new respirator.

524
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,095
Attaboy.
Come on.

525
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,490
- Come on.
- Damn it.

526
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,537
Come on!
Stay with me!

527
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:33,055
No-- no, no, no, no!

528
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,313
Come on.

529
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,482
No, no, no, no!
Come on. Come on.

530
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,317
In here.

531
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,153
Damn.

532
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,656
Okay, okay.
Stay back! Stay back!

533
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,734
Damn it.
