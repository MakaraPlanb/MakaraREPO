1
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,506
Fever's gone down.

2
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,428
Baby?

3
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,433
Carl?

4
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,686
Sophia?

5
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,771
Is she okay?

6
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,315
Fine.

7
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,901
- She's fine.
- Rest.

8
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,571
We'll be right here, okay?

9
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,823
Okay.

10
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,668
They're here.

11
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,684
How is he?

12
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,270
He'll pull through,

13
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,564
thanks to Hershel
and his people.

14
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,316
And Shane.

15
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,276
We'd have lost Carl
if not for him.

16
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,077
Thank God.

17
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,954
We were so worried.

18
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,081
- How'd it happen?
- Hunting accident.

19
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,044
That's all--
just a stupid accident.

20
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,011
Blessed be God,

21
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,973
Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

22
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,352
Praise be to Him

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,396
for the gift
of our brother Otis,

24
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,525
for his span of years,

25
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,944
for his abundance
of character;

26
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,280
Otis, who gave his life
to save a child's,

27
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,617
now more than ever,
our most precious asset.

28
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,955
We thank You, God, for the peace
he enjoys in Your embrace.

29
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,749
He died as he lived,

30
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,876
in grace.

31
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,424
Shane, will you speak
for Otis?

32
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,468
I'm not good at it.

33
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,929
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,931
You were the last one with him.

35
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,642
You shared
his final moments.

36
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,310
Please.

37
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,062
I need to hear.

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,024
I need to know
his death had meaning.

39
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,736
Meaning.

40
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,243
We were about done.

41
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,662
Almost out of ammo.

42
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,706
We were down
to pistols by then.

43
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,959
I was limping.
It was bad.

44
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,670
Ankle all swollen up.

45
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,965
"We've got to save the boy."

46
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,552
See, that's what he said.

47
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,141
He gave me his backpack.
He shoved me ahead.

48
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,603
"Run," he said.

49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,315
He said, "I'll take the rear.
I'll cover you."

50
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,569
And when I looked back...

51
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,666
If not for Otis,

52
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,212
I'd have never
made it out alive.

53
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,466
And that goes for Carl, too.

54
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,510
It was Otis.

55
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,599
He saved us both.

56
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,940
If any death
ever had meaning,

57
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,358
it was his.

58
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,116
How long has this girl
been lost?

59
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,368
This'll be day three.

60
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,829
County survey map.

61
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,081
Shows terrain and elevations.

62
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,544
This is perfect. We can finally
get this thing organized.

63
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,005
We'll grid the whole area,
start searching in teams.

64
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,007
Not you. Not today.

65
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,050
You gave three units
of blood.

66
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,138
You wouldn't be hiking five minutes
in this heat before passing out.

67
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,391
And your ankle-- push it now,
you'll be laid up a month,

68
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,226
no good to anybody.

69
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,894
Guess it's just me.

70
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,689
I'm gonna head back to the creek,
work my way from there.

71
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,399
I can still be useful.

72
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,569
I'll drive up to the interstate,
see if Sophia wandered back.

73
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,946
All right, tomorrow then.

74
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,906
We'll start doing this right.

75
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,325
That means we can't have
our people out there with just knives.

76
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,829
They need the gun training
we've been promising them.

77
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:16,292
I'd prefer you not carrying
guns on my property.

78
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,838
We've managed so far without
turning this into an armed camp.

79
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,675
All due respect, you get a crowd
of those things wandering in here...

80
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,677
Look, we're guests here.

81
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,013
This is your property

82
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,474
and we will respect that.

83
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,612
First things first:
set camp, find Sophia.

84
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,323
I hate to be the one to ask,
but somebody's got to.

85
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,450
What happens if we find her
and she's bit?

86
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,119
I think we should all be
clear on how we handle that.

87
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,706
You do what has to be done.

88
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,750
And her mother?
What do you tell her?

89
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,294
The truth.

90
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,213
I'll gather and secure
all the weapons.

91
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,216
Make sure no one's carrying
till we're at a practice range off site.

92
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,260
I do request
one rifleman on lookout.

93
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,888
Dale's got experience.

94
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,267
Our people
would feel safer,

95
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,686
less inclined
to carry a gun.

96
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,734
Thank you.

97
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,153
That stuff you brought,

98
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,656
got more antibiotics,
bandages, anything like that?

99
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,284
Just what you've seen.

100
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,912
We're running short already.
I should make a run into town.

101
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,497
Not the place Shane went?

102
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,208
No, there's a pharmacy
just a mile down the road.

103
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,085
I've done it before.

104
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,672
See our man there
in the baseball cap?

105
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,298
That's Glenn,

106
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,884
our go-to-town expert.

107
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,303
I'd ask him along
just to be cautious.

108
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,193
I hear he woke up.

109
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,988
Yeah. He's in
and out, but yeah.

110
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,324
He'll be all right.

111
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,119
That's good.

112
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,749
Did you mean it?

113
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,002
What?

114
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,629
You said stay.

115
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,673
Did you mean it?

116
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,510
Look, if you didn't
just say so.

117
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,430
But do it now.
I need to know.

118
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,226
I meant it.

119
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,939
All right then.

120
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,581
I hear you're fast on your feet
and know how to get in and out.

121
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,627
Got a pharmacy run.
You in?

122
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,630
Uh...

123
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,216
Miss, what's the water
situation here?

124
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,009
Got five wells on our land.

125
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,553
House draws directly
from number one.

126
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,347
Number-two well
is right over there.

127
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,058
We use it for the cattle
but it's just as pure.

128
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,518
Take what you need.
There's a cart and containers

129
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,771
in the generator shed
behind the house.

130
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,856
I'll go saddle
your horse then.

131
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,693
Horse?

132
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,824
Give up our guns?

133
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,701
You heard Rick.
We're guests here.

134
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,286
And you're okay with it?

135
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,622
I don't recall being asked.
Now lay down your weapon.

136
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,958
You may like rolling over,
I don't.

137
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,626
Look, I have to strip and clean
them anyway.

138
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,169
You still want to learn?

139
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,673
Go on.

140
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,842
All right.

141
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,636
Sit down.

142
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,264
Unload your weapon.

143
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,850
Hey, hey.

144
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,560
Check the chamber.

145
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,771
Pull it back.

146
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,107
Push that lever out.

147
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,610
It'll slide off.

148
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,030
You're halfway there.

149
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,833
Daryl.

150
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,460
You okay on your own?

151
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,129
I'm better on my own.

152
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,672
Don't worry,
I'll be back before dark.

153
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,841
Hey.

154
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,176
We got a base.

155
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,346
We can get this search
properly organized now.

156
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,265
You got a point
or are we just chatting?

157
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,726
My point is it lets
you off the hook.

158
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,770
You don't owe us anything.

159
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,523
My other plans fell through.

160
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,367
We could give you
more space.

161
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,369
Set up over by the barn.

162
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,872
No, no need for that.

163
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,416
Better you stay close
to the house.

164
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,668
I don't say
this easily, Rick.

165
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,379
We don't normally
take in strangers.

166
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,716
I can't have your people
thinking this is permanent.

167
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,345
Once you find this girl
and your boy's fit for travel,

168
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,889
I expect you'll move on.

169
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,183
We need to be clear on that.

170
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,283
Hello, farmer's daughter.

171
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,708
Hi.
Here's your list.

172
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,922
And, um,

173
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,925
there's one other item.
I wrote it down separately.

174
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,136
It's personal. If we could be real
discreet about that, okay?

175
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,888
Sure.

176
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,973
Thank you.

177
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,643
Uh, what is it?

178
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,937
Kind of missing the point
of the whole discreet thing, Glenn.

179
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,773
Oh, right. Um...

180
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,152
I just need to know
where to find it.

181
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,156
Try the feminine
hygiene section.

182
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,283
Oh.
Enough said.

183
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,411
Consider it done.

184
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,919
I'm not weak
and I'm not a coward.

185
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,671
I never said you were.

186
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,632
No, what I said
on the highway--

187
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,968
I don't know
what that was,

188
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,095
where it came from.

189
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,806
That wasn't me.

190
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,687
If it's okay, I'd rather you never told
anybody about that stuff I said.

191
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,815
What stuff?

192
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,860
I couldn't get a word
out of you all day.

193
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,493
Say, man, you think
there's a snowball's chance

194
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,953
we'll actually find
that little girl?

195
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,457
For the first time in my life
I'm betting on the snowball.

196
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,500
Yeah.

197
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,461
Me, too.

198
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,172
Do whatever we have to.

199
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,800
I don't care if I have to
comb the woods like Rambo

200
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,011
or fetch a pail of water.

201
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,889
Everyone kicks in,
does their part.

202
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,226
Am I right?

203
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,771
Do your part,
don't complain.

204
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,191
That's what I always--

205
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,777
I wouldn't drink that
if I were you.

206
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,296
Looks like we've got us
a swimmer.

207
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,221
How long do you think
it's been down there?

208
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,097
Long enough to grow gills.

209
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,642
We can't leave it in there.
God knows what it's doing to the water.

210
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,519
We got to get it out.

211
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,146
Easy.
Put a bullet in its head.

212
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,023
I'll get a rope.

213
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,234
Whoa, whoa, guys. No.

214
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,319
Why not?
It's a good plan.

215
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,946
It's a stupid plan.

216
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,656
If that thing hasn't
contaminated the water yet,

217
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,742
blowing its brains out
will finish the job.

218
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,662
She's right.
Can't risk it.

219
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,205
So it has to come out alive?

220
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,332
So to speak.

221
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,751
How do we do that?

222
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,589
The interstate where you
broke down is here.

223
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,716
There's your creek.

224
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,468
My farm is here.

225
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,054
We're looking out that way,

226
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,056
south-southeast.

227
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,684
We missed this branch
of the creek entirely.

228
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,519
If she went
that direction,

229
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,771
she'd be miles
from where we looked.

230
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,440
Rick, take a moment.

231
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,484
Come look.

232
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,328
That's something, isn't it?

233
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,040
It's good to pause
for an occasional reminder.

234
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,459
Of what?

235
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,461
Whatever comes to mind.

236
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,006
For me it's often God.

237
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,758
No thoughts on that?

238
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,720
Last time I asked God for a favor
and stopped to admire a view

239
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,097
my son got shot.

240
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,142
I try not to mix it up
with the Almighty anymore.

241
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:40,314
Best we stay out
of each other's way.

242
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,191
Lori told me your story--

243
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,485
how you were shot,
the coma.

244
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,487
Yet you came
out of it somehow.

245
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,740
You did not feel
God's hand in yours?

246
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,661
At that moment?

247
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,830
No, I did not.

248
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,374
In all the chaos you
found your wife and boy.

249
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,502
Then he was shot
and he survived.

250
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,296
That tells you nothing?

251
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,384
It tells me God's got
a strange sense of humor.

252
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,111
He's not going for it.

253
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,364
Maybe 'cause a canned ham
don't kick and scream

254
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,865
when you try to eat it.

255
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,204
He's right. There's a reason the dead
didn't come back to life

256
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,997
and start raiding
our cupboards.

257
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,166
We need live bait.

258
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,135
Have I mentioned that I really like
your new haircut?

259
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,221
You have
a nice shaped head.

260
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,223
Don't worry about it, bud.

261
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,100
We're gonna get you out
of here in one piece.

262
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,687
Living piece.
The living part is important.

263
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,069
- Nice and slow, please.
- We got you.

264
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,321
Oh, you people are crazy.

265
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,073
You want to get it out
of your well or not?

266
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,325
Give us an eye
there, Maggie.

267
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,260
Doing okay?

268
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,303
Yup, doing great.

269
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,597
Living the dream.

270
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,239
Little lower. Little more.

271
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,708
- Get it! Get it!
- Grab it!

272
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,585
Grab it!

273
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,299
Get me out of here!

274
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,014
Get it off.
Get off.

275
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,725
Get off!
Get me out!

276
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,729
Hang on, Glenn!

277
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,731
Get off me!

278
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,566
This is bad.
Oh, my God.

279
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,486
Guys, get me out!

280
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,781
Come on, you guys.
Get me out of here!

281
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,702
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

282
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,996
Get me out of here!

283
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,956
- Pull!
- Pull! Pull!

284
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,666
- Pull! Pull!
- Let's go, pull.

285
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,669
Get me up.
Get me up.

286
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,881
Come on, guys.

287
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,592
- Glenn!
- Pull him up!

288
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,470
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

289
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,181
Pull me up!
Pull me up!

290
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,975
Get me out of here!

291
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,314
Are you okay?

292
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,822
Back to the drawing board.

293
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,701
Says you.

294
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,206
Sophia!

295
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,007
Sophia!

296
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,825
- Come on, guys, pull.
- Come on, y'all.

297
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,868
Almost there.
Come on, pull, guys.

298
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,246
Come on.

299
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,958
Come on, y'all.
Together.

300
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,710
Almost there. Come on, pull.
Keep it coming.

301
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,461
Come on, pull.
Watch out, Dog.

302
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,297
Nice and easy.
Just a little more.

303
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,510
Come on, almost there.

304
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,554
You've got to pull it, guys.

305
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,015
It's stuck!
Come on.

306
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,689
Pull!

307
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,628
We should seal off
this well.

308
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,882
Yeah, might be
a good idea.

309
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,884
So what do we do about--

310
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,690
Good thing we didn't do
anything stupid like shoot it.

311
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,506
We'll come again tomorrow.

312
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,133
You know there's
always the chance--

313
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,887
Don't. I really don't need
to hear it anymore, Andrea.

314
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,015
Save the thoughts
and prayers.

315
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,234
You never know, Carol.

316
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,249
We can hang targets along
that fence line there.

317
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,876
That rise, it gives
a natural backstop.

318
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,296
It's a good idea.

319
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,090
Thanks.

320
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,175
So how long
before I can carry?

321
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,553
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

322
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,430
I'm not in a very patient
frame of mind these days, Shane.

323
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,850
- You might have noticed that.
- No shit.

324
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,519
Look, I ain't worried
about you offing yourself,

325
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,398
even though you got old Dale
pissing his pants lately.

326
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,694
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

327
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,864
He did come within a minute
or so of being blown to hell

328
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,615
because of me,
to be fair.

329
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,369
Look, I see you have
the desire for gun work

330
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,163
and desire will take
you a long way.

331
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,874
But something you need to know,
so file this carefully.

332
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,710
- I'm listening.
- Paper targets is one thing.

333
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,461
Easy to hit
what ain't moving.

334
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,630
But taking down
an assailant,

335
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,632
one that's trying
to kill you,

336
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,885
it's different.

337
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,056
They say in that
kind of situation

338
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,851
things slow down.
That's crap.

339
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,103
They speed up.
Adrenalin, ha.

340
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,647
It'll cripple you
if you let it.

341
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,566
You need to use
your instinct.

342
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,235
You got to rule it out.

343
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,363
Because somebody
is going to die

344
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,200
and you'd better hope that you're
the one who's making that decision.

345
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,828
How?
I mean, how do you do that?

346
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,789
Turn off a switch.

347
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,001
The switch.

348
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,755
The one that makes
you scared or angry,

349
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,757
sympathetic, whatever.

350
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:54,510
You don't think.
You just-- you act.

351
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,932
'Cause odds are somebody else
is counting on you.

352
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,768
That's your partner.

353
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,895
That's your friend.

354
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,066
There ain't nothing easy
about taking a man's life

355
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,694
no matter how little
value it may have.

356
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:15,198
But when you get it done,

357
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,742
you have to forget it.

358
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,500
I guess I haven't quite
got that last part down yet.

359
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,921
But you're getting there?

360
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,966
I hope so.

361
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,888
It's a good spot.

362
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,308
It'll do.

363
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,234
You know, normally

364
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,194
this is the kind of thing
I'd do on my own.

365
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,697
Solo.

366
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,199
It's sort of my thing,
you know?

367
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm a loner.

368
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,499
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

369
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:13,089
I saw the look on your face
back at the well.

370
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,633
Never seen one
killed up close before?

371
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,846
Guess it's kind
of a shock.

372
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,018
You know, being out on
the road, we've seen a lot.

373
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,937
Guess we've gotten
a little numb to it.

374
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,443
Whoa.
I guess so.

375
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,504
I'll go see what
antibiotics are left.

376
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,256
What else is on the list?

377
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,550
Uh...

378
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,052
why don't you get started?

379
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,554
What about you?

380
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,557
I'm gonna look around,
see what's worth grabbing.

381
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,185
Just some general stuff.

382
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,677
What do you got?

383
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,638
Uh... um...

384
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,390
nothing.

385
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,683
Just, like I said,
general stuff.

386
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,644
Condoms?

387
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,439
You got a girlfriend
I don't know about?

388
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,608
Me? No. No.

389
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,444
Then you're a pretty
confident guy.

390
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,031
No.

391
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,283
No, no, no.
I-I-I wasn't--

392
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,202
- I would never--
- Something wrong with me?

393
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,121
No.

394
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,081
No, I--

395
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,876
I would never have sex--

396
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,463
Uh, I'm-- I'm lost.

397
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,136
I'll have sex with you.

398
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,640
Really?

399
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,559
Why?

400
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,060
You're asking questions?

401
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,813
Okay, I can't help
wondering.

402
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,482
It's not like our options
are vast these days.

403
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,757
And you're not the only one
that's lonely.

404
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,487
Wow.

405
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,976
You need to reconsider.

406
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,312
I beg your pardon?

407
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,231
Asking us to leave.

408
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,150
You need to reconsider.

409
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,988
If you saw how it is
out there you wouldn't ask.

410
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,991
You're a man of belief.

411
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,661
If you believe anything,
believe that.

412
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,329
You're putting me
on the spot.

413
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,207
Well, I mean to.

414
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,001
Those people look to me
for answers.

415
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,087
I wish they didn't,
but they do.

416
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,090
But I'm not asking
for them or myself.

417
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,551
I'm asking for my boy.

418
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,345
After the price
your friend Otis paid,

419
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,389
the least you can do
is give it some thought.

420
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,891
You're a plainspoken man.

421
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,018
I'm a father.

422
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,689
He's the one thing
I don't want to fail.

423
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,609
I feel like I do every day.

424
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,490
I lied to him this morning.

425
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:54,954
It wasn't a big lie,
but it was enough.

426
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,708
My father didn't bother
with comforting lies.

427
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,459
He used his fist.

428
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,671
He was a loveless,
violent drunk

429
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,464
and no good to anybody.

430
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,426
He drove me from home
when I was 15.

431
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:12,096
Didn't lay eyes on this place
again for many years.

432
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,807
I was not
at his deathbed, Rick.

433
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,642
I would not grant him that

434
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,729
and to this day
do not regret it.

435
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,399
Some men do not earn
the love of their sons.

436
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,159
I don't see you
having that problem.

437
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,206
Will you consider
my request?

438
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,836
There are aspects to this,

439
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:48,883
things that I can't
and won't discuss.

440
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:52,219
But if you and your people
respect my rules,

441
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,098
no promises,
but I will consider it.

442
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,392
You have my word.

443
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,273
You have mine.

444
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,450
Hey.

445
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,123
I'll sit with him.

446
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,087
He was awake earlier
when you were gone.

447
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,172
He asked for you.

448
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,357
- I--
- Don't spoil it.

449
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,611
So it was good.

450
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,738
It was a one-time thing.

451
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,038
- Everything go okay?
- Fine.

452
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,418
Nothing happened.

453
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,513
Did you find it?

454
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,714
I cleaned up.

455
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,466
Wanted it to be
nice for her.

456
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,011
For a second I thought
I was in the wrong place.

457
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,105
A flower?

458
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,984
It's a Cherokee rose.

459
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:18,199
The story is that
when American soldiers

460
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,453
were moving Indians
off their land on the Trail of Tears

461
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,582
the Cherokee mothers were
grieving and crying so much

462
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,959
'cause they were losing their
little ones along the way

463
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,755
from exposure and disease

464
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,090
and starvation.

465
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,638
A lot of them
just disappeared.

466
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,766
So the elders,
they said a prayer;

467
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:47,436
asked for a sign to uplift
the mothers' spirits,

468
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,689
give them strength

469
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,691
and hope.

470
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,072
The next day this rose

471
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,116
started to grow right where
the mothers' tears fell.

472
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,287
I'm not fool enough

473
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:09,375
to think there's any flowers
blooming for my brother.

474
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:16,257
But I believe this one

475
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,344
bloomed for your little girl.

476
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,863
She's gonna really
like it in here.

477
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,048
Hey, Dad.

478
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,552
Hey.

479
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,478
Carl,

480
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,357
I told you something earlier
today about Sophia--

481
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:18,402
I know.
Mom told me.

482
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,616
Here I was getting ready
to confess.

483
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,121
I didn't mean to lie.
I just didn't want to worry you.

484
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,790
It's a stupid excuse

485
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,375
but it's all I got.

486
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,419
It's okay.

487
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,506
Do you think
we'll find her?

488
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,675
I know we will.

489
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,762
Well...

490
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,725
I don't know.

491
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,687
But I truly believe it.

492
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,523
You look tired.

493
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,319
I am tired.

494
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,489
Hey, I'm like you now.

495
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:06,075
We've both been shot.

496
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,536
Isn't that weird?

497
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,748
Yeah, I think your mother would
rather hear we got the same eyes.

498
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,249
So let's keep that
between us.

499
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,297
Since you're in
the club now,

500
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,091
you get to wear the hat.

501
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,551
Didn't you know?

502
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,397
We'll pad the rim tomorrow
so it sits better.

503
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,066
Won't you miss it?

504
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,570
Maybe you'll let me borrow
it from time to time.

505
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,698
We can share it.

506
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,783
Okay.

507
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,451
Sleep now.

508
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,495
Okay.

509
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,872
I love you, Dad.

510
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,209
I love you.

511
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,962
Are you putting them away?

512
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,358
Stay with him
a while longer.

513
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,944
I'll wait up.
