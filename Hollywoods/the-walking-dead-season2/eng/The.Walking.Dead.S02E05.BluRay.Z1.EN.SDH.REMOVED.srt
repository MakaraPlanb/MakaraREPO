1
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,084
Are we gonna go soon?

2
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,378
I don't know, baby.
I sure hope so.

3
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,214
- I'm hungry.
- I know, Carl. We all are.

4
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,467
Why don't I get
him something to eat?

5
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,845
Ed's into all this
survival stuff.

6
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,139
We've got enough MREs
to feed a small army.

7
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,766
- I'd sure appreciate it.
- No trouble.

8
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,440
What in the hell
did you tell her that for?

9
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,817
We don't even know
these damn people.

10
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,278
That boy is hungry.
We can spare one box.

11
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:13,781
It's called
operational security.

12
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,783
How long do you think
this stuff is gonna last

13
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,202
if you keep running your damn
mouth off to everybody we meet?

14
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,830
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

15
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,421
Are you getting anything?

16
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,257
- There's nothing.
- Big surprise there.

17
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,593
No, I mean there's nothing.

18
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,429
Emergency Broadcast
System stopped,

19
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,599
and that recording about
the refugee center.

20
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,185
It's all gone.

21
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,895
I'm gonna go up the road,
see what I can see.

22
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,772
I'll come with you.

23
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,607
Ed must have forgot
to pack those MREs.

24
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,902
- I found these in my purse.
- It's all right.

25
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,196
Listen, do you mind keeping
an eye on Carl for a minute?

26
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,864
No.

27
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,908
Shane and I are gonna go
scout up ahead a little bit

28
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,785
and see if we can find someone
that knows what's going on.

29
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,953
- I want to come with you.
- Huh-uh.

30
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,789
Huh-uh.

31
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,501
Hey, we'll be back before you know it.
Okay, little man, huh?

32
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,049
Why would they stop
broadcasting about the refugee center?

33
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,968
- I don't know.
- Think they're turning people away?

34
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,639
They're gonna have a riot
on their hands if they try.

35
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,772
- Your dad's nice.
- Shane's not my dad.

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,316
My dad's dead.

37
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,868
- What do we do?
- Come here.

38
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,120
We're gonna do what Rick
would have wanted us to do,

39
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,581
get you and Carl
out of here.

40
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,015
That's not lightning.

41
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,268
You stay with me now.
Come on.

42
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,830
Oh, my God.

43
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,671
Oh, God.

44
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,677
They're dropping napalm
in the streets.

45
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,806
Shane.

46
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,017
Come here.

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,566
Morning.

48
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,373
- Morning.
- Good morning.

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,926
I can't believe I slept in.

50
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,470
You must have needed it.

51
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,263
Feeling all right?

52
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,975
Next time wake me, all right?
Especially on laundry day.

53
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,893
I can manage.

54
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,020
I had an idea
I wanted to run by you.

55
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,480
What's that?

56
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,482
That big kitchen of theirs
got me thinking.

57
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,318
I wouldn't mind cooking
in a real kitchen again.

58
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,238
Maybe we all pitch in

59
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,740
and cook dinner for Hershel
and his family tonight.

60
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,328
Kind of looking for things
to keep my mind occupied.

61
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,998
After everything
they've done for us,

62
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,374
seems like the least
we could do.

63
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,293
You mind extending
the invitation?

64
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,132
Would just feel more
right coming from you.

65
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,009
How so?

66
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,677
You're Rick's wife.

67
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,888
It sort of makes you
our unofficial First Lady.

68
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,433
Morning, guys.
Let's get going.

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,184
We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

70
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,064
All right, everyone's getting
new search grids today.

71
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,608
If she made it as far as
the farmhouse Daryl found,

72
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,694
she might have gone further
east than we've been so far.

73
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,279
I'd like to help.

74
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,489
I know the area
pretty well and stuff.

75
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,033
Hershel's okay with this?

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,702
Yeah, yeah.
He said I should ask you.

77
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,454
All right then.
Thanks.

78
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,540
Nothing about what Daryl found
screams Sophia to me.

79
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,334
Anyone could have been
holed up in that farmhouse.

80
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,753
Anybody includes her, right?

81
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,589
Whoever slept in that cupboard
was no bigger than yay-high.

82
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,175
- It's a good lead.
- Maybe we'll pick up her trail again.

83
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,135
No maybe about it.
I'm gonna borrow a horse,

84
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,138
head up to this ridge right here, take
a bird's-eye view of the whole grid.

85
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,348
- If she's up there, I'll spot her.
- Good idea.

86
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,392
Maybe you'll see your
chupacabra up there, too.

87
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,187
- Chupacabra?
- You never heard this?

88
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,066
Our first night in camp, Daryl tells
us that the whole thing reminds him

89
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,527
of a time when he went squirrel
hunting and he saw a chupacabra.

90
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,072
What are you braying at, jackass?

91
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,908
So you believe in
a blood-sucking dog?

92
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,785
Do you believe dead people
walking around?

93
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,789
Hey, hey.
Ever fire one before?

94
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,582
Well, if I'm going out,
I want one.

95
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,918
Yeah, and people
in hell want Slurpees.

96
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,253
Why don't you come
train tomorrow?

97
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,547
If you're serious,
I'm a certified instructor.

98
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,175
For now he can
come with us.

99
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,427
He's yours to babysit then.

100
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,310
All right, Andrea, T-Dog,
I want you guys...

101
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,455
Nice guitar.

102
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,624
Dale found it
on the highway.

103
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,754
You know, we still
have 11 condoms.

104
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,548
Yeah, you see 11 condoms,

105
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,758
I see 11 minutes of my life
I'm never getting back.

106
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,346
It wasn't that bad,
was it?

107
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,974
Look, I don't even know
if I like you.

108
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,351
But you're thinking about it.

109
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,562
You should.

110
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,171
You remember the name of that
waitress at the Dairy Queen

111
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,841
when we were in high school?

112
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,760
I know you, Shane, well enough
to know that there is only one

113
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,263
sure-fire way of engaging
you in a conversation,

114
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,850
and that is to start asking you
about girls you did in high school.

115
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,061
I don't want to, but I'll willing
to do it if that's what it takes.

116
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,899
Maryanne.

117
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,859
I told you about her?

118
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,736
In excruciating detail.

119
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,571
Excruciating, my ass.

120
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,908
You used to live for those
details back in the day.

121
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,702
Yeah, I was impressionable.

122
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,996
And I may have been living
vicariously through you.

123
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,706
Why wouldn't you,

124
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,335
with my impressive list
of accomplishments?

125
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,338
I was an artist
in his prime.

126
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,174
- A protégé.
- You mean prodigy.

127
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,259
Maybe.

128
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,387
Is prodigy what you call
a young high school stud

129
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,139
that bangs 30-year-olds
on the regular?

130
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,351
What 30-year-old were you
banging in high school?

131
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,856
- The PE Teacher.
- Mr. Daniel?

132
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,067
Mrs. Kelly.

133
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,735
The girls volleyball coach?

134
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,987
- Wasn't she married?
- C'mon.

135
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,530
You know what
I just remembered?

136
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,283
Why I never ask you
about this stuff.

137
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,411
Why don't we talk about your
high school love life then, huh?

138
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,497
Well, that's
a short conversation.

139
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,457
- It may even already be over.
- That right?

140
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,584
There was Holly, right?

141
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,587
Nope, that was me, too.

142
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,382
Then there was Sheila.
That's the one you lied to me about.

143
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,008
I never lied about Sheila.

144
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,803
I just got mixed up about
what the bases meant.

145
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:59,265
Just so you know, a home run,
that usually means a sexual act.

146
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,184
- That's intercourse.
- Yeah, I realize that now.

147
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,979
I think what you did was more like
a ground rule double or something.

148
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,939
I'm aware
of the judge's ruling.

149
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,363
Shouldn't be talking
about this stuff.

150
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,783
That life, it's gone
and everyone in it.

151
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,536
Sheila.

152
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,746
Maryanne.
Mrs. Kelly.

153
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,374
It's like we're old folk.

154
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,543
All the people
in our stories are all dead.

155
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,296
- We can't just forget them.
- The hell we can't.

156
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,674
It's hard enough accepting
what's happened

157
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,718
without digging
up the past.

158
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,012
I'll tell you what it is.

159
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,722
It's nostalgia.

160
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,932
It's like a drug.

161
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,310
Keeps you from seeing
things the way they are.

162
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,645
That's a danger.
You got people depending on you.

163
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,273
You think
I don't know that?

164
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,483
I don't know.

165
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,485
What are we doing?

166
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,612
You got every able body
at your disposal

167
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,615
out scourging these woods for a little
girl we both know is likely dead.

168
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,617
You think we should
abandon the search?

169
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,077
It's not my call, is it?

170
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,663
I'm asking.
I'm asking.

171
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,250
Survival, Rick.
It means making hard decisions.

172
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,211
But you've got this knack.
You spread us thinner and thinner.

173
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,088
I'm trying
to save lives here

174
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,466
and you're out saving
cats from trees.

175
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,593
Is that what you think
Sophia is, a cat in a tree?

176
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,345
Don't do that, man.
Don't twist my words.

177
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,181
How many times we get called up
to look for a missing child, man?

178
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,266
You got 72 hours.
72 hours, and after that

179
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,727
you're looking for a body.
And that was before.

180
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,356
I mean you honestly think
we're just gonna find Sophia alive?

181
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,983
Are you that sure we won't?

182
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,195
- We being completely honest?
- I'm counting on you to be.

183
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,030
It's math, man.

184
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,574
Alive or not, Sophia,
she only matters

185
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,452
to the degree in which she don't
drag the rest of us down.

186
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,749
I thought you wanted honest.

187
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,752
If we'd just moved on, man,
we'd be halfway to Fort Benning

188
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,754
right now and Carl
wouldn't have gotten shot.

189
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,882
You said so yourself.
But we're out here, we're risking lives.

190
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,177
Your own son almost died.
Otis, he paid that bill.

191
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,762
What the hell are we
still doing this for?

192
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,639
I had her in my hand, Shane.
She looked in my eyes

193
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,058
and trusted me.
I failed her.

194
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,559
If I hadn't,
she wouldn't be out here.

195
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,020
I think she's still alive
and I'm not--

196
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,689
I'm not gonna write her off.

197
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,404
It's blue.

198
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,656
It's Andrea and T-Dog.

199
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,325
Looks like we wandered
into their grid.

200
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,856
Whoa.

201
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,485
Sophia!

202
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:05,093
Whoa. Easy, easy.

203
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,936
Come on.

204
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,992
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

205
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,676
Son of a bitch.

206
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,266
Mind your own
business, Glenn.

207
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,727
You're pregnant.

208
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,524
You can't tell
anybody, okay?

209
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,409
You haven't told him yet?

210
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,593
Something wrong?

211
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,601
I just had
a long talk with Shane.

212
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,440
He wants to call off
the search.

213
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,277
What do you think?

214
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,405
What if it was Carl?

215
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,157
Would you want us
to keep looking?

216
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,159
If it was Carl, yes I'd want
to know one way or another.

217
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,120
Shane says my good intentions
are making us weaker,

218
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,831
that I can't make the hard decisions
for the good of the group.

219
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,124
They're all hard decisions.

220
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,168
But maybe I'm holding on
to a way of thinking

221
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,295
that doesn't make
sense anymore.

222
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,839
He says it's math,
basic survival--

223
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,966
how much fuel, how much food,
how much ammo.

224
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,302
Not much room in that
equation for being soft.

225
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,263
It's pretty simple when you start
thinking of life like that.

226
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,765
Hey.

227
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,934
None of us were prepared
to be living life this way.

228
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,561
You are making the best
decisions you can

229
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,523
with the information you have.
I don't see soft in that.

230
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,443
Mr. Grimes.
My dad wants to talk to you.

231
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,514
Oh, come on.

232
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,975
You've done half.
Stop being such a pussy.

233
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,185
Come on.

234
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,087
One of my horses
is missing.

235
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,631
Did one of
your people take it?

236
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,967
I was given the impression
you knew about that.

237
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,385
I did not.

238
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,681
I'll have a word with Daryl.

239
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,641
And Jimmy?

240
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,644
You took him out today.

241
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,939
Did he also give you
the impression of my consent?

242
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,692
No, he said it outright.
I took the boy at his word.

243
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,485
Jimmy is 17.

244
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,363
He's not my kin,
but I am responsible for him.

245
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,741
These things need
to be cleared with me.

246
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,036
Sounds like we need to work
on our communication.

247
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,537
What do you suggest?

248
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,414
Keep it simple.

249
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,752
I'll control my people,
you control yours.

250
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,587
Why don't you pull
that arrow out, dummy?

251
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,631
You could bind
your wound better.

252
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,467
Merle.

253
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,136
What's going on here?

254
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,305
You taking a siesta
or something?

255
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,932
A shitty day, bro.

256
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,434
Like me to get
your pillow?

257
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,437
- Maybe rub your feet?
- Screw you.

258
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:58,274
Huh-uh. You're the one screwed
from the looks of it.

259
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,069
All them years I spent
trying to make a man of you,

260
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,780
this is what I get?
Look at you.

261
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,491
Lying in the dirt
like a used rubber.

262
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,244
You're gonna die
out here, little brother.

263
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,122
- And for what?
- A girl.

264
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,959
They lost a little girl.

265
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,044
So you got a thing
for little girls now?

266
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,879
Shut up.

267
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,632
'Cause I noticed you ain't out
looking for old Merle no more.

268
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,343
Tried like hell
to find you, bro.

269
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,846
Like hell you did.
You split, man.

270
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,056
Lit out first chance
you got.

271
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,768
You lit out.
All you had to do was wait.

272
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,687
We went back for you.

273
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,564
Rick and I,

274
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,858
we did right by you.

275
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,194
This the same Rick that cuffed me
to the rooftop in the first place?

276
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,655
Forced me to cut off
my own hand?

277
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,742
This him we're talking
about here?

278
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,202
You his bitch now?

279
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,996
I ain't nobody's bitch.

280
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,165
You're a joke
is what you are,

281
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,750
playing errand boy
to a bunch of

282
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,336
pansy-asses, niggers,
and democrats.

283
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,049
You're nothing
but a freak to them.

284
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,509
Redneck trash.

285
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:07,927
That's all you are.

286
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,681
They're laughing at you
behind your back.

287
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,099
You know that,
don't you?

288
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,518
I got a little news
for you, son.

289
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,396
One of these days, they're gonna
scrape you off their heels

290
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,857
like you was dogshit.

291
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,197
Hey.

292
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,407
They ain't your kin,

293
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,743
your blood.

294
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,914
Hell, you had any damn nuts
in that sack of yours,

295
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,833
you'd got back there and shoot
your pal Rick in the face for me.

296
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,465
Now you listen to me.

297
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:49,094
Ain't nobody ever gonna care about
you except me, little brother.

298
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,474
Ain't nobody ever will.

299
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,602
Come on,
get up on your feet

300
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,605
before I have to
kick your teeth in.

301
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,360
Let's go.

302
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,113
Come on.

303
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,875
Son of a bitch was right.

304
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,723
Please, don't feed the birds.

305
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,608
What's the matter, Darylina?

306
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,610
That all you got in you?

307
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,071
Throw away that purse
and climb.

308
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,699
I liked it better
when you was missing.

309
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,618
Come on, don't be like that.

310
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,705
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah? Since when?

311
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,873
Hell, since the day
you were born, baby brother.

312
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,835
Somebody had to look after
your worthless ass.

313
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,045
You never took care of me.

314
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,798
You talk a big game,
but you was never there.

315
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,093
Hell, you ain't here now.
Some things never change.

316
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,137
Well, I'll tell you what--

317
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,472
I'm as real
as your chupacabra.

318
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,433
I know what I saw.

319
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,146
And I'm sure them shrooms you ate
had nothing to do with it, right?

320
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,772
You'd best shut the hell up.

321
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,774
Or what?

322
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,319
You're gonna come up here
and shut my mouth for me?

323
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,487
Well, come on
and do it then,

324
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,489
if you think
you're man enough.

325
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,909
Hey, kick off them damn
high heels and climb, son.

326
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,664
You know what?

327
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,334
If I were you, I'd take a pause
for the cause, brother.

328
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,502
'Cause I just don't think
you're gonna make it to the top.

329
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,716
Come on.
Come on, little brother.

330
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,843
Grab your friend
Rick's hand.

331
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,747
Yeah, you'd better run.

332
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,210
It's nice to be cooking
in a real kitchen again.

333
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,963
Oh, yeah? I never thought
I'd be so happy to see a potato peeler.

334
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,593
I'm just glad we're not roasting
squirrels over a fire in the woods.

335
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:44,138
Thank you, Patricia, so much
for letting us into your house.

336
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,515
What's this?

337
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,850
Lori and Carol are cooking
dinner for us all tonight.

338
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,268
That's the first
I've heard of it.

339
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,728
Well, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

340
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,897
They want to thank us
for helping them.

341
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,900
We need to be setting clear
boundaries with these people.

342
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,111
They're getting
a little too comfortable.

343
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,196
It's just dinner.

344
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,907
What's going on with you
and the Asian boy?

345
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,910
Glenn.
He's a friend.

346
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,829
I'd rather he wasn't.

347
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,039
Bad enough I have to chase
Beth and Jimmy around.

348
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,958
Well, you don't have
to chase me around.

349
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,794
- I'm not 16.
- I know you're not.

350
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,046
That's why I'm counting on
you to be the mature one.

351
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,216
You know how I feel.

352
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,219
Please don't make things
harder than they need to be.

353
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,764
I'm a little old for us to be having
this conversation.

354
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,936
Don't get close to them.

355
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,939
They're not going
to be around forever.

356
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,618
What's with
the Annie Oakley routine?

357
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,787
I don't want to wash
clothes anymore, Dale.

358
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,539
I want to help
keep the camp safe.

359
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,124
Is that all right with you?

360
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,971
Sorry.
Just returning your book.

361
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,224
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

362
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,144
If I had known
the world was ending,

363
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,481
I'd have brought
better books.

364
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,490
Dale, you think
Andrea's on her period?

365
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,494
I'm only asking 'cause
it's like all the women

366
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,746
are acting really weird.

367
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:35,333
And I read somewhere
that when women

368
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,669
spend a lot of time together,
their cycles line up

369
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,840
and they all get super crazy
hormonal at the same time.

370
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,470
I'm gonna advise you

371
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,472
to keep that theory
to yourself.

372
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,517
- Yeah.
- Who else is acting weird?

373
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,691
- Maggie.
- Ah, Maggie.

374
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,860
She started off
being mean to me.

375
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,529
Then she wanted
to have sex with me.

376
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,906
And now she's being
mean to me again.

377
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,909
And I don't even want to know
what's going on with Lori.

378
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,702
What's going on with Lori?

379
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,165
Nothing.
I don't know.

380
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,544
All right, let's take
this back a step.

381
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:25,383
How do you know that Maggie
wanted to have sex with you?

382
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,098
Oh, son, you didn't.

383
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:37,103
Did it ever occur to you how
her father might feel about this?

384
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,647
She's 22.

385
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:43,067
And he is our host.

386
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,153
He doesn't know.

387
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,738
Well, see that it
stays that way.

388
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,201
Jesus, Glenn,
what were you thinking?

389
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,704
I was thinking

390
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,831
that I might
be dead tomorrow.

391
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,086
Thanks for the book.

392
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,922
You're right, it sucks.

393
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,767
Walker. Walker!

394
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,443
Just the one?

395
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,616
I bet I can
nail it from here.

396
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,119
No, no, Andrea.
Put the gun down.

397
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,247
You'd best let
us handle this.

398
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,750
Shane, hold up.
Hershel wants to deal with walkers.

399
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,585
What for, man?
We got it covered.

400
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,378
Damn it.

401
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,082
- Andrea, don't.
- Back off, Dale.

402
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,842
Is that Daryl?

403
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,345
That's the third time you've
pointed that thing at my head.

404
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,806
You gonna pull
the trigger or what?

405
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,187
No!

406
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,650
No! Stop!

407
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,491
Rick!

408
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,831
What on earth's
going on out here?

409
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,547
- Oh, God.
- Come on.

410
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,091
- I was kidding.
- Come on.

411
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,929
Oh, my God.

412
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,014
Oh, my God,
is he dead?

413
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,059
Unconscious.
You just grazed him.

414
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,978
But look at him.
What the hell happened?

415
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,564
He's wearing ears.

416
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,777
Let's keep that
to ourselves.

417
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,238
Guys, isn't this Sophia's?

418
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,790
I found it washed up
on the creek bed right there.

419
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,084
She must have dropped it
crossing there somewhere.

420
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,794
Cuts the grid
almost in half.

421
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,213
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- How's he looking?

422
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,884
I had no idea we'd be going through
the antibiotics so quickly.

423
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,429
Any idea what
happened to my horse?

424
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:02,057
Yeah, the one who almost killed me?
If it's smart, it left the country.

425
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,602
We call that one Nelly,
as in nervous Nelly.

426
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,563
I could have told you she'd throw
you if you'd bothered to ask.

427
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:11,650
It's a wonder you people
have survived this long.

428
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,868
He'll be all right.

429
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,580
I hate to say it, but I'm with
Hershel on this one.

430
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,124
Can't keep going out there,
not after this.

431
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,085
You'd quit now?
Daryl just risked his life

432
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,296
to bring back the first
hard evidence we've had.

433
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,173
That is one way
to look at it.

434
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,134
The way I see it, Daryl almost
died today for a doll.

435
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,303
Yeah, I know
how you see it.

436
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,812
I'm not out to be a hard case.
Just being realistic.

437
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,983
He's just got to start
making the tough calls.

438
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,069
You know I'm right.

439
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,321
I may not agree with
all of his choices,

440
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,323
but I respect him.

441
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,575
I know yours and mine

442
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,744
and your way isn't harder.

443
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,623
It's the easiest thing in the world
to cut our losses and to not help.

444
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,375
You keep telling yourself

445
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,918
you're making the tough calls.
You're really just trying--

446
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,671
The only thing I care about now
in this world is you and Carl.

447
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,716
So I apologize
if I appear to be insensitive

448
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,302
to the needs of others,
but you see

449
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,930
I'll do whatever it takes
to keep the two of you safe.

450
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,183
Even abandoning
a lost child?

451
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,270
Really?

452
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,066
My son and I are not
your problem anymore,

453
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,860
or your excuse.

454
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,042
- How's he doing?
- He'll be fine.

455
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,670
What about you?

456
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,006
I shot Daryl.

457
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,974
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

458
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,852
We've all wanted
to shoot Daryl.

459
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,208
Baby, what do I do?

460
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,672
Dinner's ready.
You coming?

461
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,257
Mm-hmm.

462
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:46,096
- You need anything?
- Huh-uh, I'll be right there.

463
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,222
Does anybody know
how to play guitar?

464
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,434
Dale found a cool one.

465
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,771
Somebody's got to know
how to play.

466
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,984
Otis did.

467
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,780
Yes, and he was
very good, too.

468
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,286
How are you feeling?

469
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,664
As good as I look.

470
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,503
I brought you some dinner.
You must be starving.

471
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,681
Watch out,
I got stitches.

472
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,103
You need to know something.

473
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,564
You did more for
my little girl today

474
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,775
than her own daddy
ever did in his whole life.

475
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,571
I didn't do anything Rick
or Shane wouldn't have done.

476
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,740
I know.

477
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,951
You're every bit
as good as them.

478
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,330
Every bit.

479
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,987
You weren't supposed
to see this.
