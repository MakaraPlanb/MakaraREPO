1
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,146
I guess I'm losing hope
that you can hear me.

2
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,941
But there's always that
chance, isn't there?

3
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,276
That slim chance.

4
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,113
It's all about
slim chances now.

5
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,283
I tried to do
everything right,

6
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,744
keep people safe.

7
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,955
I tried, Morgan.

8
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:42,333
I tried.

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,171
Our group's smaller now.

10
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:50,341
We lost another,
day before last.

11
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,845
It was her choice.

12
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,847
I won't say I blame her.

13
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,015
She lost faith.

14
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,852
The CDC was a dead end.

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,647
I met a man there,

16
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,108
a scientist.

17
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,736
He told me something.

18
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,489
He told me...

19
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,660
it doesn't matter.

20
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,912
What matters
is we're moving on.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,165
Atlanta's done.

22
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,625
We're gonna try
for Fort Benning.

23
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,671
We're facing a long
hard journey,

24
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,174
maybe even harder
than I can imagine.

25
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,760
But it can't be harder
than our journey's been so far.

26
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,512
Can it?

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,724
125 miles--

28
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,684
that's what lies ahead.

29
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,230
And I'm trying hard
not to lose faith.

30
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,983
I can't.
If I do, the others...

31
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,905
my family, my wife...

32
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,243
my son.

33
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,204
There's just a few
of us now.

34
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,582
So we've got to
stick together,

35
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,751
fight for each other,

36
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,379
be willing to lay down
our lives for each other

37
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,257
if it comes to that.

38
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,676
Son, let's saddle up.

39
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,054
It's the only chance we've got.

40
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,107
Be careful
out there, Morgan.

41
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,611
I hope you and Duane
are okay.

42
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,406
Stay off the road.

43
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,951
Keep moving.

44
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,662
Keep your eyes open.

45
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,956
I don't know, just--

46
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,542
just be safe.

47
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,005
Maybe we'll see you
in Fort Benning someday.

48
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,593
Rick signing off.

49
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,562
I was just thinking about our trip
to the Grand Canyon with Carl.

50
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,194
I don't remember that.

51
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,613
No, you wouldn't.
You were just a baby.

52
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,157
Besides, we never made it
past Fort Worth.

53
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,702
No, you got sick. I never knew a baby
could throw up so much.

54
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,579
Ick.

55
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,831
Yeah, ick.

56
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,000
The doctor in Texas
said you'd live.

57
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,920
Then we turned around
and drove home.

58
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,756
That sucks.

59
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,926
No, it was a good trip.

60
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,928
The best.

61
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,682
Can we go see it?
The Grand Canyon?

62
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,934
I'd like to.

63
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,228
I would too.

64
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,438
Can we go?

65
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,774
We'd never go without
you and your mom.

66
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,443
That's a promise.

67
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,957
Looks complicated.

68
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,793
The trick is getting
all these pieces

69
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,087
back together
the same way.

70
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,839
I could clean yours,

71
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,632
show you how.

72
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,351
Oh, yeah.

73
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,812
It's a sweet piece.

74
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,939
It was a gift

75
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,816
from my father.

76
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,987
He gave it to me just before Amy
and I took off on our road trip.

77
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,115
He said two girls
on their own

78
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,784
should be able
to defend themselves.

79
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,995
Smart man, your father.

80
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,873
Look, it's a--

81
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,375
it's a limited capacity.

82
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,669
See? Only holds
seven rounds.

83
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,088
Oh, jeez.

84
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,594
Aw, no.

85
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,325
See a way through?

86
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,209
Uh, maybe we should
just go back.

87
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,545
- There's an interstate bypass--
- We can't spare the fuel.

88
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,071
Jeez.

89
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,049
Can we get through here?

90
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,444
I said it.
Didn't I say it?

91
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,072
A thousand times.
Dead in the water.

92
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,949
Problem, Dale?

93
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,451
Just a small matter of being stuck
in the middle of nowhere

94
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,328
with no hope of--

95
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,790
okay, that was dumb.

96
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,001
If you can't find
a radiator hose here...

97
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,295
There's a whole bunch
of stuff we can find.

98
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,964
I can siphon more fuel
from these cars for a start.

99
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,841
- Maybe some water.
- Or food.

100
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,093
This is a graveyard.

101
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,311
I don't know how
I feel about this.

102
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,646
All right, all right,
here we go.

103
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,357
Come on, y'all.
Just look around,

104
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,818
gather what you can.

105
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,601
Kids, don't look.

106
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,981
- Which one?
- The flathead.

107
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,525
Radiator hose clamp
is always a flathead.

108
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,028
Here, you do it.

109
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,364
Learn something.

110
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,753
Ed never let me wear
nice things like this.

111
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,424
We're gonna need clothes.

112
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,514
Hey, Carl.

113
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,474
Always within
my sight, okay?

114
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,102
You too, Sophia.

115
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,918
It's all good.

116
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,759
Okay.

117
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,348
All right.

118
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,364
Come on.

119
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,541
Glenn.

120
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,086
Were we short on water?

121
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,179
Hey, save me some!

122
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,223
It's like being baptized, man.

123
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,537
Oh, Christ.

124
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,473
Lori, under the cars.

125
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,894
Carl, Sophia,
get down now.

126
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,607
- Carl and Sophia. Sophia.
- Shh, shh. Get under.

127
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,822
Ow.

128
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,992
What?

129
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,244
Shh.

130
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,352
Oh, God!

131
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,778
Shh, shh.

132
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,935
Okay.

133
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,951
Shit.

134
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,808
Shh.

135
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,668
Shh, shh.

136
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,832
Lori.

137
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,044
- There's two walkers after my baby.
- Shh, shh.

138
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,544
Shh, shh!

139
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,922
- Are you all right? Are you okay?
- Shoot them!

140
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,548
No. No!

141
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,258
Those walkers on the road
would hear it.

142
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,427
Then it wouldn't be just two,
it'd be hundreds.

143
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,096
Come here.
Come on.

144
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,563
All right,
just hold here.

145
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,482
You stay there.
Wait.

146
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,901
Come on.

147
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,367
Sophia, you have
to do exactly as I say.

148
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,244
Hide in there.
Squeeze in tight.

149
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,287
- I'll draw them away from you.
- No, no, don't leave me.

150
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,248
Listen, listen,
listen, listen.

151
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,417
They don't get winded.
I do.

152
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,210
I can only deal
with them one at a time.

153
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,837
I wouldn't be able
to protect you.

154
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,756
This is how we both survive.
You understand?

155
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,300
Okay?
Go, go, go, go.

156
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,597
If I don't make it back,
run back to the highway,

157
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,808
back to the others
straight the way we came.

158
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,436
Keep the sun
on your left shoulder.

159
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,776
Come on!

160
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,364
You ugly son of a bitch.
Come on!

161
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,993
Come on!

162
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,666
Come on!

163
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,668
Come on!

164
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,138
Come on!

165
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,075
Sure this is the spot?

166
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,619
I left her right here.

167
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,580
I drew the walkers way off
in that direction up the creek.

168
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,334
Without a paddle--
seems where we've landed.

169
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,711
She was gone by the time
I got back here.

170
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,589
I figured she just took off
and ran back to the group.

171
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,675
I told her go that way

172
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,760
and keep the sun
on her left shoulder.

173
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,973
Hey, Short Round,
why don't you step off to one side?

174
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,474
You're mucking up the trail.

175
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,017
Assuming she knows
her left from her right.

176
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,936
Shane, she understood me fine.

177
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,021
Kid's tired and scared, man.

178
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,857
She had her a close call
with two walkers.

179
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,817
Got to wonder how much
of what you said stuck.

180
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,153
Got clear prints right here.

181
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,488
She did like you said,
headed back to the highway.

182
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,533
- Let's spread out, make our way back.
- She couldn't have gone far.

183
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,078
Hey, we gonna find her.

184
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,122
She'll be tuckered out
hiding in a bush somewhere.

185
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,717
She was doing just fine
till right here.

186
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,469
All she had to do
was keep going.

187
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,847
She veered off that way.

188
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,640
Why would she do that?

189
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,977
Maybe she saw something
that spooked her, made her run off.

190
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,687
A walker?

191
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,939
I don't see
any other footprints.

192
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,482
Just hers.

193
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,444
So what do we do?
All of us press on?

194
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:32,155
No, better if you and Glenn
get back up to the highway.

195
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,073
People are gonna
start panicking.

196
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,160
Let them know we're on her
trail doing everything we can.

197
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,162
But most of all,
keep everybody calm.

198
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,997
I'll keep 'em
busy scavenging cars.

199
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,791
Think up a few other chores.
I'll keep 'em occupied.

200
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,085
Come on.

201
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,369
Why aren't we all out there looking?
Why are we moving cars?

202
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,621
We have to clear enough
room so I can get the RV

203
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,206
turned around as soon
as it's running.

204
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,667
Now that we have fuel
we can double back

205
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,461
to a bypass that Glenn
flagged on the map.

206
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,130
Going back's going to be easier
than trying to get through this mess.

207
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,299
We're not going anywhere
till my daughter gets back.

208
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,218
Hey, that goes
without saying.

209
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,054
Rick and Daryl,
they're on it, okay?

210
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,266
- Just a matter of time.
- Can't be soon enough for me.

211
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,102
I'm still freaked out from
that herd that passed us by,

212
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,729
- or whatever you'd call it.
- Yeah, what was that?

213
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,356
All of them just
marching along like that.

214
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:52,026
A herd.
That sounds about right.

215
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,904
We've seen it. It's like the night
camp got attacked.

216
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,407
Just a wandering pack,
only fewer.

217
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,075
Okay.

218
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,828
Come on, people.
We still got a lot to do.

219
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,080
Let's stay on it.
Let's go, come on.

220
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,970
Tracks are gone.

221
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,264
No, they're faint,

222
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,433
but they ain't gone.

223
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,268
She came through here.

224
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,103
How can you tell?

225
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,439
I don't see anything.
Dirt, grass.

226
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,941
You want a lesson in tracking
or you want to find that girl

227
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,152
and get our ass off
that interstate?

228
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,985
- Shane.
- Carl, what happened?

229
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,196
Mom, I found something cool.

230
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,198
Shane, check it out.

231
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,368
It's an arsenal.

232
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,286
That's cool, bud.
Go give 'em to Dale.

233
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,288
Check this one out.

234
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,666
Whoa, it's a hatchet.

235
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,043
- Be careful. Don't play with those.
- They're really sharp.

236
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,046
- What did I just say?
- Can I keep one?

237
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,632
- Are you crazy?
- No way.

238
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,802
Shane. Shane, tell her
to let me keep one.

239
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,306
Hey, man, go give them
all to Dale now. Go.

240
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,236
- What was that?
- What was what?

241
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,072
The way you blew him off just now.
You crushed him.

242
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,248
I don't believe you.
You're giving me the cold shoulder?

243
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,041
Isn't that what you want?

244
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,919
Weren't you the one who said stay
the hell away from him and you?

245
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,464
You forget what happened
at the CDC?

246
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,467
Your little meltdown
in the rec room slip your mind?

247
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,469
- When you tried--
- When I tried to what?

248
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,262
What do you
think that was?

249
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,765
I think it is pretty plain
what that was.

250
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,977
A mistake.
One that I admit to.

251
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,938
I have a few mistakes
under my belt, Lori.

252
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,274
So do you.

253
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,776
No debate there.

254
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,613
But, Shane, we need
to stop this.

255
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,907
Why do you think
I'm prepping my new ride?

256
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,410
I'm leaving.

257
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,454
Leaving?

258
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,539
As in gone for good.

259
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,627
Gonna quietly slip away
first chance I get.

260
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,050
The Emergency Alert System
has been activated.

261
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:47,261
The Office of Civil Defense has issued
the following message:

262
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,639
normal broadcasting
will cease immediately.

263
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,808
- This is a civil emergency.
- Is that a local signal?

264
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,436
It's got to be within
50 miles of here.

265
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,189
Avoid anyone infected at all costs.
Remain calm.

266
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,732
Help is on the way.

267
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,652
The Emergency Alert System
has been activated.

268
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,237
The Office of Civil Defense--

269
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,489
Asshole.

270
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,951
Okay, let's get back to work.

271
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,932
Sophia!

272
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,983
What are you looking for?

273
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,736
Skin under the fingernails.

274
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,744
It fed recently.

275
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,711
There's flesh
caught in its teeth.

276
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,256
Yeah, what kind of flesh?

277
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,926
Only one way
to know for sure.

278
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,768
Here, I'll do it.

279
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,645
How many kills you skin
and gut in your life?

280
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,731
Anyway, mine is sharper.

281
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,936
Now comes the bad part.

282
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,635
Yeah, hoss had a big meal
not long ago.

283
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,929
I feel it in there.

284
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,815
- Here's the gut bag.
- I got this.

285
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,715
This gross bastard had himself
a woodchuck for lunch.

286
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,804
- At least we know.
- At least we know.

287
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,405
It's late.
Gonna be dark soon.

288
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,950
They'll find her.

289
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,794
Where's my gun?

290
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,587
You have no right
to take it.

291
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,422
You don't need that
just now, do you?

292
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,090
My father gave it to me.
It's mine.

293
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,885
I can hold onto it for you.

294
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,887
Or you can give it
back to me.

295
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,806
Everything cool?

296
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,265
No, I want my gun back.

297
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,101
I don't think
it's a good idea right now.

298
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,312
Why not?

299
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,107
I'm not comfortable with it.

300
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,615
The truth is,

301
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,952
less guns we have floating
around camp the better.

302
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,411
You turning over your weapon?

303
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,831
No.

304
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,834
But I'm trained in its use.

305
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,461
That's what the rest of y'all
need is proper training.

306
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,798
But until that time I think it's best if
Dale keeps them all accounted for.

307
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,092
Uh-huh.

308
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,597
Mind telling me
what that's about?

309
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,307
Oh, God, they're back.

310
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,479
You didn't find her?

311
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,231
Her trail went cold.

312
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,149
We'll pick it up again
at first light.

313
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,777
You can't leave my daughter
out there on her own

314
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,529
to spend the night
alone in the woods.

315
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,447
Out in the dark's no good.

316
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,158
We'd just be tripping over ourselves.
More people'd get lost.

317
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,828
But she's 12. She can't be out
there on her own.

318
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,872
- You didn't find anything?
- I know this is hard.

319
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,331
But I'm asking you
not to panic.

320
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,708
We know she was out there.

321
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,418
And we tracked her
for a while.

322
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,920
We have to make this
an organized effort.

323
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,797
Daryl knows the woods
better than anybody.

324
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,383
I've asked him to oversee this.

325
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,844
Is that blood?

326
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,141
- We took down a walker.
- Walker? Oh, my God.

327
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,019
There was no sign it was
ever anywhere near Sophia.

328
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,521
How can you know that?

329
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,194
We cut the son
of a bitch open, made sure.

330
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,034
Oh, God.

331
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:33,500
How could you just leave her
out there to begin with?

332
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,795
How could you
just leave her?

333
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,839
Those two walkers
were on us.

334
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,926
I had to draw them off.

335
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,385
It was her best chance.

336
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,887
Sounds like he didn't
have a choice, Carol.

337
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,640
How was she supposed to
find her way back on her own?

338
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,809
She's just a child.
She's just a child.

339
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,563
It was my only option.
The only choice I could make.

340
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,567
I'm sure nobody
doubts that.

341
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,992
My little girl got left
in the woods.

342
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,611
Everybody takes a weapon.

343
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,613
These aren't the kind
of weapons we need.

344
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,366
- What about the guns?
- We've been over that.

345
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,660
Daryl, Rick and I
are carrying.

346
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,621
We can't have people popping off
rounds every time a tree rustles.

347
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,331
It's not the trees
I'm worried about.

348
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,542
Say somebody fires
at the wrong moment,

349
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,085
a herd happens
to be passing by.

350
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,004
See, then it's game over
for all of us.

351
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,797
So you need
to get over it.

352
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,551
The idea is to take the creek
up about five miles,

353
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,469
turn around and come
back down the other side.

354
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,471
Chances are
she'll be by the creek.

355
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,098
It's her only landmark.

356
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,808
Stay quiet and stay sharp.

357
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,853
Keep space between you but always
stay within sight of each other.

358
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,063
Everybody assemble your packs.

359
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,232
Dale, keep on those repairs.

360
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,234
We've got to get
this RV ready to move.

361
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,112
We won't stay here a minute
longer than we have to.

362
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,573
Good luck out there.

363
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,783
Bring Sophia back.

364
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,493
Keep an eye on Carl
while we're gone.

365
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,329
I'm going with you.

366
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,999
You need people, right?
To cover as much ground as possible.

367
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,255
Your call.
I can't always be the bad guy.

368
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,176
Well, he has all of you
to look after him.

369
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,428
I'd say he's in good hands.

370
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,931
Okay. Okay.

371
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,350
But always within our sight,
no exceptions.

372
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,864
Andrea, I'm begging you.
Don't put me in this position.

373
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,991
I'm not going out
there without my gun.

374
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,659
I'll even say please.

375
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,996
I'm doing this for you.

376
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,123
No, Dale, you're doing
it for you.

377
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,959
You need to stop.
What do you think's gonna happen?

378
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,252
I'm gonna stick it in my mouth

379
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,046
and pull the trigger the moment
you hand it to me?

380
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,381
I know you're angry at me.

381
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,383
That much is clear.

382
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,844
But if I hadn't
done what I did,

383
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,013
you'd be dead now.

384
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,264
Jenner gave us an option.

385
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,725
- I chose to stay.
- You chose suicide.

386
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,685
So what's that to you?
You barely know me.

387
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,563
- I know Amy's death devastated you.
- Keep her out of this.

388
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,274
This is not about Amy.
This is about us.

389
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,903
And if I decided that I had
nothing left to live for,

390
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,905
who the hell are you
to tell me otherwise?

391
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,699
To force my hand like that?

392
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,744
- I saved your life.
- No, Dale.

393
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,080
I saved yours.
You forced that on me.

394
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,082
I didn't want
your blood on my hands

395
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,042
and that is the only reason
I left that building.

396
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,962
What did you expect?
What, I'd have some kind of epiphany?

397
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,381
Some life-affirming catharsis?

398
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,217
Maybe just a little gratitude.

399
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,844
Gratitude?

400
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,304
I wanted to die my way,

401
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,598
not torn apart
by drooling freaks.

402
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,976
That was my choice.

403
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,728
You took that
away from me, Dale.

404
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,022
- But--
- But you know better?

405
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,194
All I wanted after my sister
died was to get out

406
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,947
of this endless horrific nightmare
we live every day.

407
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,700
I wasn't hurting
anyone else.

408
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,035
You took my choice
away, Dale.

409
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:41,206
And you expect gratitude?

410
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,090
I don't know what to say.

411
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,635
I'm not your little girl.

412
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:57,014
I'm not your wife. And I am sure
as hell not your problem.

413
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,933
That's all there is to say.

414
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,013
Shane, look.

415
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,599
Dad said I could carry it and Mom
said as long as I was--

416
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,685
Keep it down.
We're looking for Sophia.

417
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,312
You need to focus
on the task.

418
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:51,568
- Got to keep up.
- I am.

419
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,406
- You okay?
- I think Shane's mad at me.

420
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,992
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

421
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,328
No, honey, I promise you.

422
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:05,082
He's just-- he's worried about
Sophia, that's all.

423
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,896
She could be in there.

424
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,232
Could be a whole bunch
of things in there.

425
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,605
Carol.

426
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:17,654
Call out softly.

427
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,782
If she's in there, yours is the first
voice she should hear.

428
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,495
Sophia, sweetie,

429
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,539
are you in there?

430
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,000
Sophia, it's Mommy.

431
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,753
Sophia.
We're all here, baby.

432
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,921
It's Mommy.

433
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:13,293
Daryl?

434
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,631
Daryl?

435
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,180
It ain't her.

436
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,518
- What's in there?
- Some guy.

437
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,396
Did what Jenner said.
Opted out.

438
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,190
Ain't that what
he called it?

439
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,414
What direction?

440
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,542
I think that way.
I'm pretty sure.

441
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,252
Damn, it's hard
to tell out here.

442
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,962
If we hear them,
maybe Sophia does too.

443
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,797
Someone's ringing those bells,
maybe calling others.

444
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,382
Or signaling
that they found her.

445
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,093
She could be ringing
them herself. Come on.

446
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,519
Ain't you supposed to be
fixing that radiator?

447
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,020
What if they come
back with Sophia

448
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,064
and Rick wants to
move on right away?

449
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,610
- I had it fixed yesterday.
- What?

450
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,113
What was all that rubbing
and sanding for then?

451
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,949
- That just bullshit?
- Yeah, that's one word.

452
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,702
Another word
would be pantomime--

453
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,954
just for show.

454
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,957
No one else needs
to know that.

455
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,461
Pantomime.

456
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,713
If the others know
we're mobile,

457
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,132
they'll want to mobilize
and move on.

458
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,551
So you don't think
they're gonna find Sophia, that it?

459
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,803
I'm just guarding
against the worst.

460
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,139
Sooner or later,
if she's not found,

461
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,766
people will start
doing math.

462
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:56,313
I want to hold off
the needs-of-the-many-

463
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,983
versus-the-needs-of-the-few
arguments as long as I can.

464
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,071
That is one
tricky hose, huh?

465
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,324
Very.

466
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:20,504
That can't be it.
Got no steeple, no bells.

467
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,507
Rick.

468
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:47,424
Sophia!

469
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,304
Yo, JC,
you taking requests?

470
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,557
I'm telling you, it's the wrong church.
It's got no steeple, Rick.

471
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:57,892
There's no steeple.

472
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:15,410
A timer.
It's on a timer.

473
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:21,041
I'm gonna go
back in for a bit.

474
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:48,318
Are you really leaving?

475
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,153
Don't you think
it's best for all of us?

476
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:53,448
I think it is.
What made you decide?

477
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,826
Gotta back away. Just trying to be
the good guy here, Lori,

478
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,746
even if you don't see it.
None of this was intended.

479
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,791
I hope you know that.

480
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:06,670
Well, don't matter.
As long as I said it.

481
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,756
You're just gonna disappear?
You're not even gonna tell Rick?

482
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,716
He'd only try to stop me.
No, that's on you.

483
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,052
You tell him what you want.
Or tell him nothing at all.

484
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,845
- You're his wife.
- And Carl?

485
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,430
We dragged him into this.

486
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,182
- I love Carl.
- He thinks you hate him.

487
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,351
I'm trying to put some distance.
I'm trying to make this easier.

488
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,561
This ain't easy on any
of us, least of all me.

489
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,605
I'm the one who loses you.

490
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,764
Father, forgive me.

491
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,893
I don't deserve Your mercy.

492
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:09,357
I prayed for safe passage
from Atlanta and You provided.

493
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,569
I prayed for Ed
to be punished

494
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,237
for laying his hands on me

495
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,574
and for looking
at his own daughter

496
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:21,202
with whatever sickness
was growing in his soul.

497
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,414
I prayed You'd put
a stop to it,

498
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,251
give me a chance
to raise her right,

499
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,878
help her not
make my mistakes.

500
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,839
She's so fearful.

501
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,093
She's so young in her way.

502
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:40,096
She hasn't had a chance.

503
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:49,314
Praying for Ed's death
was a sin.

504
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:56,237
Please, don't let this
be my punishment.

505
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:00,575
Let her be safe,

506
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:03,119
alive and safe.

507
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,081
Please, Lord.

508
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,293
Punish me however You want,

509
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,464
but show mercy on her.

510
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:32,899
I'm coming with you.

511
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,484
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

512
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,653
I'm not stupid
and I'm certainly not deaf.

513
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,322
- Look, I don't know the story.
- There is no story.

514
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,741
Fine, I don't care. Don't confuse me
with someone who does.

515
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,660
Look, all I care about
is getting out of here

516
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:46,412
as far away as I can,
like you.

517
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,289
We're gonna sail off into
the sunset together?

518
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,791
We gonna hold hands?

519
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,334
I'm not asking you
to go steady, Shane.

520
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:55,839
I'm asking for a ride, a chance
to start over somewhere else.

521
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,341
You observe
this group lately?

522
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:01,636
I have. I see two people
who don't belong.

523
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,555
We're the odd men out.

524
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,099
Between the two of us,
we make a great third wheel.

525
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:09,519
So what?
Say we do, we just run off.

526
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,146
What's in it for me except for
the extra ass I got to cover?

527
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,774
The chance to do something
for someone else.

528
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:18,486
- Yeah.
- And a door that swings both ways.

529
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,613
Put a gun in my hand,
I'll cover your ass, too.

530
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,910
Think it over.

531
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,169
Got to move here, man.

532
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,172
These people are spent.

533
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,592
There's only so many
hours of daylight left.

534
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,261
- We still got a long way back.
- I can't stop yet.

535
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,971
We still got
a lot of ground to cover,

536
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,514
whole other side
of the creek bed.

537
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,099
So we search that
on the way back.

538
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,476
She would have heard those
church bells. She could be nearby.

539
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,771
- She could be a lot of things.
- I can't go back.

540
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,899
Her being out here
is my fault.

541
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,567
That's great.

542
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,736
Now they got you
doubting yourself, huh?

543
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,030
What about you?
You doubt me?

544
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,949
Hey, we can assign
all kinds of blame.

545
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,076
This means something,
finding her.

546
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,037
Oh, man.

547
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,707
It would be the miracle we need.
We can't give up.

548
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,586
Mmm.

549
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,840
Ahem.

550
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,052
Y'all gonna follow the creek bed back.
Okay, Daryl, you're in charge.

551
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,179
Me and Rick, we're just
gonna hang back,

552
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:28,556
search this area another hour
or so just to be thorough.

553
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,309
You're splitting us up.
You sure?

554
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,603
Yeah, we'll catch up to you.

555
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,730
I want to stay, too.

556
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,900
I'm her friend.

557
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,117
- Just be careful, okay?
- I will.

558
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,454
When did you start
growing up?

559
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,212
I'll be along soon enough.

560
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,259
Here, take this.

561
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,053
Remember how to use it?

562
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,180
I'm not taking your gun
and leaving you unarmed.

563
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,517
Here, got a spare.
Take it.

564
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,659
Give me a minute?

565
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,204
Come on.

566
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,512
I don't know if you're
looking at me with what?

567
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,600
Sadness?

568
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,020
Scorn?

569
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,189
Pity?

570
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,359
Love?

571
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,572
Maybe it's just indifference.

572
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,498
I guess you already know
I'm not much of a believer.

573
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:20,668
I guess I just chose to
put my faith elsewhere.

574
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,881
My family, mostly.

575
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,508
My friends.

576
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,511
My job.

577
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,851
The thing is, we--

578
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:45,193
I could use a little something
to help keep us going.

579
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,530
Some kind of...

580
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:51,699
acknowledgement.

581
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,911
Some indication I'm doing
the right thing.

582
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,373
You don't know
how hard that is to know.

583
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,884
Well, maybe you do.

584
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,270
Hey look, I don't need
all the answers.

585
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,815
Just a little nudge.
A sign.

586
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,695
Any sign will do.

587
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:42,166
- Get what you needed?
- Guess I'll find out.

588
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:01,727
So this is it?

589
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,604
This the whole plan?

590
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:06,274
I guess the plan is
to whittle us down

591
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,067
into smaller
and smaller groups.

592
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,194
Carrying knives
and pointy sticks.

593
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,946
I see you have a gun.

594
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:14,490
Why, you want it?

595
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,951
Here, take it.

596
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:20,955
I'm sick of the looks
you're giving me.

597
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,669
All of you.

598
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:33,134
Honey, I can't imagine
what you're going through.

599
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:34,343
And I would do
anything to stop it.

600
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,429
But you have got to stop
blaming Rick.

601
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:39,265
It is in your face
every time you look at him.

602
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:42,810
When Sophia ran he didn't
hesitate, did he?

603
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,395
Not for a second.

604
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,565
I don't know that any of us would
have gone after her the way he did

605
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,026
or made the hard decisions
that he had to make

606
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:53,279
or that anybody could have
done it any differently.

607
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,452
Anybody?

608
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:10,087
Y'all look to him and then you blame
him when he's not perfect.

609
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,632
If you think you can do this
without him, go right ahead.

610
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,634
Nobody is stopping you.

611
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,648
We should keep moving.

612
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,015
Shane.

613
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,175
Oh, no. No.

614
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,761
No, no, no, no!
