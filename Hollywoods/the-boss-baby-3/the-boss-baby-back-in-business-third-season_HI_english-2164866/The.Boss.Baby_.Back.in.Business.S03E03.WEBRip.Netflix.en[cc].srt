00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,695
Parents will believe anything
when it comes to their babies.

174
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,864
But unlike that fraud Happy Sedengry,

175
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,700
you'll be telling the truth
because you have me.

176
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,034
Now smile, Templeton.

177
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,412
Ninety-seven percent of sales
is showmanship.

178
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,663
[door opens]

179
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,498
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

180
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,917
I'm Tim Templeton,
and this is my baby brother.

181
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,835
[babbles]

182
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,464
Again, I already bought a magazine
subscription from the Namashitas.

183
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,092
But did you buy any magazines
for your baby?

184
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,931
[both babbling]

185
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,559
My brother and I have
an awesome friendship.

186
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,227
I just get babies, you know?

187
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,438
The kid's a wacko for boats.

188
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,275
Let's try Expensive Boats Weekly.

189
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,360
[cooing, babbling]

190
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,237
[laughs] Wow!

191
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,531
But I still don't see
what he's gonna do with a magazine.

192
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,951
Spend hours with it... [whispers] quietly.

193
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,624
I'd like a two-year subscription.

194
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,126
[babbling]

195
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,044
Mm-hmm.

196
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:24,962
[toy squeaks]

197
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,255
She's into balloons.

198
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,424
Dirigible Enthusiast!

199
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,635
[babbling]

200
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,720
Hotcakes Aficionado!

201
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,763
[babbling]

202
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:39,060
-[Tim] Poodle Week... and Prison Kitties!
-[squealing]

203
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,269
[giggles]

204
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,355
Three-year subscriptions for each!

205
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,234
I'm totally on pace to get
the Jonathan Pumpernickel Magic Kit!

206
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,486
All this and a clean favor ledger.

207
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,862
Here's to Babbilism.

208
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,198
[speaking gibberish]

209
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,116
-That wasn't a swear, was it?
-Uh...

210
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,161
let's just say it'd get you arrested
in all but one Canadian province.

211
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,871
-[gasps]
-Come on, outlaw.

212
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,374
We'll pick it back up tomorrow
after playgroup.

213
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,544
Who's ready to be whipped
into mission shape?

214
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,628
What?

215
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,338
-[grunts]
-Uh...

216
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,006
No one else is coming?

217
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,050
- Not even Mega Fat?
-[babbles]

218
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,095
That is not insulting you.
I'm just saying we need the whole team!

219
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,429
Just cover for me.

220
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,098
I wanna find out what's going on.

221
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,225
[slurping]

222
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,601
-Mega Fat!
-Aah!

223
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,646
Oh! You scared the living
nutritional shake out of me.

224
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,022
Why are you home?
Are you sick?

225
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,691
Never, ever been healthier.

226
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,610
Also, never, ever attending
playgroup again.

227
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,489
Happy Babbilized me and he said that
I said the playgroup was holding me back.

228
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,490
What?

229
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:39,287
-But you didn't say that, did you?
-No, but, duh and doy, he's certified.

230
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,705
Best wishes on your journey,

231
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,791
but my number-one baby job
is to make my mommy lady happy.

232
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,043
So, buh-bye, bad-influence baby!

233
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,336
Oh!

234
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,632
Wha--? Where's Dakota?

235
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,595
[Happy] Yeah, but can you really
put a price on your baby's happiness?

236
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,430
But-- But she was rock-solid!

237
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,639
And Scooter Buskie?

238
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,851
How does a faker like Sedengry
get him to go along?

239
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:02,935
I need answers!

240
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,647
Insightful. Thank you.

241
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,066
Why, I've Babbilized babies
from Biloxi to Bora Bora.

242
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,235
He's coming back.
You're going to get Babbilized.

243
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,738
No matter what he says,
you must resist. Got me?

244
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,241
[Mayor chuckles]
There's my precious bundle of joy.

245
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,368
I hear you're a quiet one, eh?

246
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,704
[speaking gibberish]

247
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,873
Stay strong, silent sister.

248
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,460
-[babbling]
-[gasps] My baby's making noises!

249
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,129
Sweet yams! He's a miracle worker!

250
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,548
No. No! It's just a parlor trick.

251
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,591
Has to be, right?

252
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,717
Well, there it is.

253
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,053
She says she's very quiet
because she hates playgroup.

254
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,763
Let me give you my prices.

255
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,098
[door opens]

256
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,476
-[door closes]
-Oh, great! Ready to sell?

257
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,353
Eyes on the Pumpernickel prize!

258
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,147
About that, got a bit of a situation.

259
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,775
Happy Sedengry is trying
to tear apart my playgroup.

260
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,943
-Why would he do that?
-Greed, Templeton.

261
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,489
Isolate parents from one another,
Happy becomes the lone advisor,

262
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,032
makes a crib-full of cash.

263
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,116
[groans]

264
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,244
[Gina laughs] Yeah!

265
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,121
[Tina] Sorry, we got carried away

266
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,957
with all the fun prizes we won
through our efficient salesmanship.

267
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,959
Namashitas!

268
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,297
-Don't let them rattle you.
-I'm not angry, I'm fired up-gry!

269
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,298
That's the spirit!

270
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,966
You should do fine on your own tonight.

271
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,551
Hold on one second!

272
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,804
You still have a lot of ledger time
to make up.

273
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,056
And I will make it up, just not today.

274
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,726
I know the "why," but how that Babbilist
gets babies to respond...

275
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,228
that's the mystery.

276
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:31,023
One that can only be solved
by inviting the devil into our home.

277
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,275
You're gonna let yourself be Babbilized?

278
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,611
I thought Mom and Dad
are too smart for that scam.

279
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,031
They are, which is why
I'll be occupied the rest of the day.

280
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,075
I have to go full naughty baby.

281
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:45,246
Mommy and Daddy will have no choice
but to call for help from that Babbilist.

282
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,207
I can't sell magazines
without a baby to translate for me.

283
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,000
Sorry, I'm closed for business.

284
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,294
Time for some face time!

285
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,214
Sorry, Jimbo. I'm no longer-- Ooh!

286
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,091
Two birds, meet stone.

287
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,594
Jimbo will help you sell magazines.

288
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,055
Tim will keep you company
like in the old days.

289
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,098
And me?

290
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:08,227
I've got an appointment with getting
an appointment with the Babbilist.

291
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,187
Tantrum! Tantrum! Tantrum! Tantrum!

292
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,399
[crying]

293
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,609
[Mom] Ted, what's wrong with the baby?

294
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,446
[babies giggling]

295
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,489
My cousin and I have
such an awesome friendship.

296
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,199
I just get babies, you know?

297
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,869
I can figure out
what magazine he'd appreciate.

298
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,872
[babies continue giggling]

299
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,252
What does he like?

300
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,838
I don't know,
but he sure likes being tickled!

301
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,465
What am I supposed to do with that?

302
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,759
Um, since your guy enjoys, uh...

303
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,846
giggling so much, he'd love...

304
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,057
-Modern Falconry?
-No, wait, he's...

305
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,603
-[screaming, crying]
-...really afraid of birds.

306
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,980

-Oh, come on, you haven't eaten all day!

312
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,161
It's the mashed beet-mobile!
Vroom-vroom, vroom!

-[spoon clatters]
-[crying]

314

Pudding! All aboard
the Puddinooga Choo-Choo.

315
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,171
Chugga, chugga, choo-choo!

316
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,547
Uh...

317
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,760
-[giggling]
-At least you stopped crying.

318
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,428
[wailing]

319
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,515
Honey, where did we put the number
of the guy who talks to babies?

320
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,432
[crying stops]

321
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,810
[Boss Baby crying]

322
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,941
Make it quick, Templeton.
I can't let them think I've been tamed.

323
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,109
Tomorrow's my last day to sell magazines!

324
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,403
If you don't help me,
forget the magic kit.

325
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,865
I'll be lucky to earn...
"math-themed binders"

326
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,659
or "soil collector set"?

327
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,912
-No luck with Jimbo?
-No one helps me like you do.

328
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,748
That's the whole reason
we started the ledger you just ignore.

329
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,291
You know my stakes here.

330
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,795
That playgroup Happy's destroying
is the only way I get my job back.

331
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,798
My mission is just more... important?

332
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,720
You think your dumb business baby garbage
is more important than fun kid stuff?

333
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,807
I feel like the honest answer
is the wrong one here.

334
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,476
-Are they calling that baby talker?
-Yes.

335
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,521
Good! I hope he tells Mom and Dad
that you need to start acting

336
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,649
like a regular baby brother
and less like a dumb adult!

337
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,109

Come on, guy.

340
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,114
The Babbilist is here.

00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,074
[Boss Baby continues crying]

342
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,826
There's that stylish fella.

343
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,996
-Oh, thank you for coming so quickly.
-No worries.

344
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,458
Good news about babies: there's always
a simple reason they're unhappy.

345
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,918

348
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,216
Oh, that's what I thought.
It's that playgroup.

349
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,428
Every baby in there goes on and on
about how much they hate it.

350
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,387
Are you sure?

351
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,890
He seems so happy
with his little friends.

352
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,310
I'm gonna ask him how he'd feel
if you pulled him from the playgroup.

355
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,566
Mm. Yeah, he'd like that quite a bit.

356
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,486
But they always look
like they're having fun.

357
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,907
Wanna tell us how you really feel
about the playgroup, fella?

364
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,337
Yeah, playgroup's scarred him pretty bad.
But no worries.

365
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,297
Pull him out,
take a few sessions with me,

366
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,757
he'll be good as new.

367
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,386
Now, if you like, I can offer you a bundle
of ten sessions at a generous discount.

368
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,347
That's kind of a big commitment.

369
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,848
Hmm, is it?

370
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,266
Suit yourselves.

371
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,519
But I am going on Marsha Krinkle's
chat show tomorrow,

372
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,981
and, fair warning, once I'm on Channel 8,
you know, I'll be very famous.

I know how he made a huge fool of you.

384
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,556
It's the rings! On his fingers!

385
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,518
They're Jonathan Pumpernickel rings
from the kit!

386

-How do they work?
-I'll show you...

when we crash Marsha's show
and expose him as a fraud on live TV!

What's it mean?

400
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,054
It means I can talk to babies.

-I'm certified by Bubbeezee.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

I think this guy's off his rocker!

-May I demonstrate?
-Of course!

405
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,067
As you all know,
I have adopted a wonderful baby

406
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,278
and I just happen to have him here.

407

I hear you're interviewing
Babbilists today.

409

Well, I'm the best one in town.

410
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,872
-Uh, what is this?
-I'll tell you what this is.

They call me
Tim "Razz-matazzle-dazzle" Templeton.

415
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,091
This is my baby brother, who will
demonstrate the ancient art of babbling.

416
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,969
-It's "Babbilizing," actually.
-Not the way I do it.

417
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,807
Oh! We have got ourselves
a good old-fashioned babble-off!

418
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,725
Yeah!

419
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,979

how much he likes his mum.

That's amazing... and true!

424
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,200

that I'm holding up three fingers.

Not a lot of people know this,
but babies love jokes.

429

Aw, that's not incredible,
that's his brother!

437
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,233
Come on, I'd like to see him try
on a baby he's not related to, eh?

438
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,734
An excellent suggestion!

439
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,736
Are there any other babies
in the audience?

Why would there be other babies?

got into the studio,

It's your last day, right?

00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,386
So, last night, I made some calls,
set up some sit-downs...

463
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,096
for you and me.

464
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,306

we're done here, so let's finish this.

No! I-I--

468

-No... [stammers] they're, uh, heirlooms.

Uh, so, it's quite--
it's quite serious, actually.

470
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,364
If it's so serious,
then why are you laughing?

I'm not lau-- [laughing]

472
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,619
Did I just make you laugh
against your own will?

473
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,454
That must make you very angry.

474
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,830

No...

480
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,844

as Babbilizing.

They're called "hypno-rings,"

You're telling me and our entire audience

495
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,962
that there's no actual secret power
for talking to babies?

496
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,046
That is correct!

497
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,342
So, anyone who claims to know
what babies want is an absolute fraud?

498

501
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,935
and I say I know what magazines
your baby wants

502
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,645

513
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,641
Bubbeezee apologized
for certifying that charlatan

514
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,060
-and gave us all free products!
-Eh? Eh?

515
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,147
I got safety zips and socket plugs!

516
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,483
Doing the right thing
and getting product into homes.

517
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,027
-Smart business.
-[Tim] Scoot over.

518
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,779
I need some sand
for my daily soil collection.

519
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,366
Oh, put that poor man's prize away.

520
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,368
I can't stand to see you like this.

521
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,956
-[gasps] How did you get this?
-I bought it... with money.

522
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,666
It only retails for 15 bucks,

523
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,670
which is nuts because you did a grand
in sales for that magazine company.

524
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,548
Consider it a down payment
for the time I still owe you.

525
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,301
Here's what I think of brothers
keeping track of favors.

526
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,886
Pumpernickel, rye!

527
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,971
Ledger... bye-bye!

528
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,932
Wizardry! How-How did you--?

529
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,727
-A true magician never reveals--
-[Mrs. Buskie] Scooter, no!

530
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,272
[babies shouting]

531
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,107
Look at my field team go.

532
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,276
Baby Corp, here I come.
