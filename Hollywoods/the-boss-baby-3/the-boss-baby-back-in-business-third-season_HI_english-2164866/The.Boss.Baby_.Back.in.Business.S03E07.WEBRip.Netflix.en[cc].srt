172
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,915
Baby gate? [scoffs] Child's play.

173
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,251
[grunts] Ha! [grunting] Oh!

174
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,421
[grunting]

175
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,215
What the goo-gah? [grunts]

176
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,260
-It's like baby flypaper!
-[monitor chiming]

177
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,845
Yo, Boss, where are you?

178
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,263
You said five minutes!

179
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,514
I'm stuck.

180
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,101
This Bubbeezee baby-proofing
is the toughest I've ever seen.

181
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,061
Windows-- all code locked.

182
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,482
Front door-- a brutal-looking
spinny knob cover.

183
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,192
No baby could beat this.

184
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,361
Wait! Mail slot's in doorknob range.

185
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,530
If you had a long enough arm...

186
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,824
Get Templeton out of school!

187
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,328
Bubbeezee never banked
on babies working with big kids.

188
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,039
-[line rings]
-[man] Kulkelka Canyon School.

189
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,457
Go, Kazooers!

190
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,502
[in deep voice] Yes, hello.
This is Janice Templeton.

191
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,963
I'm afraid Timmy's Uncle Max
got mangled by a bobcat

192
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,508
and I need him to meet me ASAP.

193
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,302
Also this is his dad,
and he's gotta see the butt doctor!

194
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,845
Oh! Oof!

195
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,140
[gasps, straining] Hmm?

196
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,436
[keypad beeping]

197
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,854
-[chimes, alarm blaring]
-Huh?

198
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,189
Oh! [strains]

199
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,567
Knock it off, snitches!
What did I do wrong?

200
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,528
Aah! Oh!

201
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,947
-Jinjja?
-[keypad beeping]

202
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,740
-[Boss yelps]
-[Ted] That's my boy's alarm!

203
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,242
Anything wrong, Hae-Sook?

204
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,910
False alarm!

205
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,872
Sorry, kid. Let it make you tough,
like an animal.

206
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,207
Bones, Aegi.

207
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,085
[keypad beeps, chimes]

208
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,714
I got a job interview that evaporates
in under 15 minutes.

209
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:14,178
You've come through big for me before,
but this baby versus Bubbeezee breakout

210
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,264
may be this playgroup's
toughest test yet.

211
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,432
Oh, I love tests! Here's one.

212
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,893
Boss Baby takes Baby Corp off his plate.

213
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,271
Now he has an empty plate.

214
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,439
Question: what do you call that?

215
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,441
-Off-topic.
-[imitates buzzer]

216
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,652
The answer is freedom!

217
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,903
So, you're not helping me?

218
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:35,366
I am helping you... by not helping you.

219
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,120
-[scatting]
-[babies babble]

220
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,538
No, ignore Mega Fat!

221
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,164
I'm leaving this house.

222
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,709
If you're wondering why you should
stick your neck out for me,

223
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,921
just remember, what's good for Baby Corp
is good for all babies.

224
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,923
And I'm good for Baby Corp.

225
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,174
Now, who's got my back?

226
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,343
[shouts]

227
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,596
Jarreau, love the initiative,
still need a plan.

228
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,556
-[alarm blaring]
-[gasps] No, no, no, no!

229
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,725
You're just going to get
the parents up here.

230
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,226
[penguins chirping]

231
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,144
[screaming]

232
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,395
[Kel] Jarreau!

233
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,773
-[Jarreau crying]
-Shut this noise down!

234
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:12,111
We've got to protect his hearing.
He has a future in the percussive arts!

235
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,197
Deactivating is so easy with Bubbe--

236
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,992
-Just shut it off!
-Okay, jeez.

237
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,702
-[alarm stops]
-Are you okay?

238
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,078
Do your ears work?

239
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,706
Drumroll my face if you can hear me.

240
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,124
[sighs] Oh!

241
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,002
Lock up when you're done
comforting your little runaway.

242
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,254
Seal the deal, Showbiz.

243
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,598
You don't want this back on, do you?

244
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,058
I hear you.

245
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,684
Uh...

246
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,394
no one has to know, right?

247
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,814
That sticky baby gate
should hold you guys plenty fine.

248
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,650
Bones.

249
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,817
One obstacle down.

250
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,277
Let's get to work.

251
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,821
Mom! Where are you?

252
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,033
Please tell me Uncle Max is okay
before we go to the butt doctor!

253
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,785
-[zaps]
-[Staci] Psst!

254
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,497
What are you guys doing here?
Have you seen my mom?

255
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,290
There is no "your mom."

256
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,209
I called to get you out of school.

257
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,920
You had me worried about
my second favorite uncle for nothing?

258
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,004
Yeah?

259
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,547
And on kabob day?

260
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,176
That means I miss the school-wide
hamburger sword fight! [grunts]

261
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,637
Calm down, man!
Your brother needs you.

262
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,305
Get this to him.
He's stuck at Krinkle's.

263
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,517
And he needs to get to Baby Corp
for a job-back interview.

264
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,643
Wait, really?

265
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,813
-That's awesome. What's the plan?
-[vocalizes "I don't know"]

266
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,191
We gotta get back to make sure
the CEO doesn't blow the office to bits

267
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,235
before your brother
even gets his interview.

268
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,529
Have fun fixing everything. Bye!

269
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,406
But what if I get caught skipping?

270
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,533
-[monitor chiming]
-Oh!

271
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,535
Hey, it's me. This better be quick.

272
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,494
It's kabob day.

273
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,371
You're a lifesaver, Templeton.

274
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,749
And don't worry, I'll have you back
burger fencing in no time.

275
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,626
[groans] Time's running out!

276
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,378
You got those penguins corralled?

277
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,256
[penguins chirping]

278
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,467
And everybody's good not pooping
for the next ten to 20 minutes?

-[babies whimper]

280

[groans] Taffeta, block the sensor.

281
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,349
[Dakota shouts]

282
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,065
-Nice work.
-[Mega Fat] Mm, is it?

283
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,859
Is work nice?

284
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,360
Not getting into this right now.

285
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,821
Your journey is your own, of course,

286
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,449
but if baby love
is all about happy babies,

287
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,660
then may-perhaps
I would invite you to ask yourself,

288
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,288
"Was I happier then or now?"

289
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,333
Joy-- Aah!

290
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,377
Your turn to shine.

291
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,712
Get us over that gate.

292
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,089

294
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,927
Dakota, Buskie, let's move out.

295
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,848
-You sure this is okay?
-[grunts]

296
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,765
Here goes.

297
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,601
Sorry! Sorry!

-[coos]

299
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,483
-I'm at the door. You here?
-[Buskie giggles]

300
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,902
I'm trying to be like a ninja,

301
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,863
but turns out I'm a pretty slow ninja,
so I'll need a minute.

302
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,199
[slurping]

303
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,283
Aah! [muffled shout]

304
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,577
-[burps]
-Danny, what are you doing here?

305
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,870
Had a dentist appointment.

306
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,247
My dad let me stay out of school,
so I parked myself

307
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,250
near the jaggedest sidewalk crack
I could find to watch people trip.

308
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,377
[both shout]

309
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,463
[laughing]

310
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,380
[muffled laugh]

311
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,716
I have to bring my baby brother
his chupie,

312
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,927
so I got out of school on a lie
and I can't get caught

313
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,137
because today is kabob day,
and I want to--

314
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,473
Why didn't you tell me it was kabob day?

315
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,183
-Whoa! [grunts]
-[thuds]

316
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,768
[laughs]

317
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,228
I'm so ironic.

318
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,859
-I brought your chupie.
-Excellent.

319
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,695
But I can't use it here.
Too much Bubbeezee interference.

320
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,947
You need to bust me out.

321
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,323
You see that mail slot?

322
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,407
Slot spotted.

323
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,535
Slide your arm in and unlock the door.

324
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,955
-It's got a spinny knob protector, so--
-The mail slot's locked!

325
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,665
-Bubbeezee!
-[thuds]

326
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,832
[groans] Focus.

327
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,209
Still got a few minutes.

328
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,710
Maybe we can crack it on our end.

329
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,380
Reminder: it's kabob day
and I'm starving.

330
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,548
[stomach growls]

331
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,758
Hang on. Let me try the back door.

332
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,971
[penguin chirping]

333
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,390
You've probably seen these
around the neighborhood.

334
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:13,143
-I've sold Bubbeezee packages...
-[Boss groans] Parents everywhere!

335
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,020
There's no way I could slip past all of...

336
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,565
"Bubbeezee A to Zeezee."

337
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,901
-We need that book.
-[penguin screeching]

338
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,112
No! No, no, no, no! Shh!

339
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,864
-[Boss shouts]
-[screams]

340
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,907
-[parents murmur]
-How'd they get out?

341
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,912
They must have climbed
right over this baby.

342
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:37,251
But only because someone forgot
to turn the Invisiblocker back on.

343
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,881
[sucks in breath] Ooh, I heard climbing
can give babies permanent vertigo.

344
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:48,220
Don't worry, everyone,
Bubbeezee products, when used properly,

345
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,891
can keep babies safer
than napping on a bed of marshmallows.

346
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,100
Look at my baby!

347
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,436
He's been exposed to 24-7 Bubbeezee,

348
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,230
and he's the only one
who didn't wander off.

349
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,984
[chuckles] So, let me just turn
everything back on.

350
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,194
Wait! I say we vote.

351
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,114
This whole system is a little over the top
if you ask me.

352
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,991
I vote no. Who's with me?

353
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,660
One, two.

354
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,789
And I vote yes.

355
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,957
Who's with me?

356
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,418
One, two.

357
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,254
Make up your minds, you two.

358
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,173
I'll vote how Ted votes.

359
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,217
-I'm a political coward.
-Um...

360
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,177
Come on!

361
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,558
I think we should turn it back on?

362
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,812
I just can't shake that feeling I had
when my guy broke his wrist.

363
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,942
[beeping, chimes]

364
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,403
Time for the exciting conclusion
of our presentation.

365
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,905
Then scones.

366
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,742
[Ted] Oh, boy, I can go
for some scones.

367
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,243
D'aah!

368
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,287
I'm minutes from the interview of my life

369
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,707
and I'm being held captive
by a multilevel marketing scheme!

370
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:01,752
Take it.

371
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,881
Clangclang will teach you rhythm skills
and smiling and conformity.

372
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,424
-[Boss] Yah!
-[gasps]

373
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,759
[Mega Fat gasps] Oh!

374
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,470
I need out!

375
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,057
How? How? How? How?
How? How? How?

376
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,393
[gasps] You took it?

377
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,396
You took it! You conniving little thief!

378
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,438
Ha ha!

379
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
-Watch.
-Mine.

380
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,528
Six minutes to go.

381
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,406
Now, how do I remove this?

382
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,449
-Aha!
-[bracelet beeps]

383
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993
[chirping]

384
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,829
"The queen is larger than the rest."

385
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,499
[chirping stops]

386
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,754
[beeps]

387
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,339
[powers down]

388
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,884
-You may poop at will!
-[babies cheering]

389
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,053
"I am an adult.

390
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,056
-Acknowledge my voice and disengage."
-[beeps]

391
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,474
[grunts]

392
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,397
It's so easy with Boss Bab-eezee.

393
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,274
Still there, Templeton?

394
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,484
-[Tim] How much longer?
-Matter of seconds.

395
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,696
I have the manual, so I'll be able
to unlock this mail slot in...

396
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:11,989
[gasps]

397
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,825
-[shouts]
-[Tim] Unlock it when?

398
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,494
[stomach growls]

399
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,663
I'm so hungry, I'm getting light-headed.

400
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,581
[groans]

401
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:21,999
Timothy!

402
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,626
[gasps]

403
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,837
Are you a little kabob man?

404
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,672
That's irrelevant. Follow me.

405
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,300
[chickens clucking]

406
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,428
Our leader, Queen Fried Chicken Drumstick,

407
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,097
was slain in battle against Lord Mouth.

408
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,100
Pull the sword
from this giant filet mignon...

409
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,020
-[gasps]
-...and you will be crowned King of Lunch!

410
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,899
[grunting]

411
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,693
-It won't budge!
-[Kabob Man] Don't give up!

412
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,737
I'm quite sure you're the chosen one.

413
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,030
-I think.
-[grunting]

414
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,907
Let me double-check my notes.

415
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,159
Well, someone named Tim is, for sure...

416
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,120
-Mega Fat Regular Baby!
-That's my name.

417
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,289
Keep saying it
because I love being acknowledged.

418
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,500
You ripped a page out of the manual.

419
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,002
The page I needed to clear the front door!

420
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,714
It's not enough trying to get in my head?
You also have to sabotage me?

421
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,927
No, I'm a good boy baby
on a path of righteousness.

422
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,514
How would my taking that page
help your journey to personal fulfillment?

423
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,391
I don't know! I just know you took it.

424
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,102
-Not me.
-You.

425
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,520
-Not me.
-You!

426
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,021
-Not me.
-[Buskie laughs]

427
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,565
[coos]

428
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,775
Told you it wasn't me.

429
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,318
Scooter...

430
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,195
give me that page.

431
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,404
Please?

432
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,364
-[screams]
-D'oh!

433
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:39,535
No, nothing bad will happen to you,
especially if you give me the page.

434
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,495
Then cookies will happen to you!

435
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,497
-[Buskie babbles]
-Huh! That's ridiculous!

436
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,292
Of course I'll still use all of you
for missions once I'm back at Baby Corp.

437
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,253
-Why would you think-- Oh!
-[Buskie babbles]

438
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,130
Stronger language than I would've used,

439
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,299
but, yes, I know you've all been
busting your butts for me.

440
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,634
[shouts]

441
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,428
[crying]

442
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,888
Wha--?

443
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,768
Never.

444
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,020
-[Buskie sniffling, crying]
-Scooter...

445
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,021
All of you...

446
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,107
I will never forget you.

447
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,316
You're my team.

448
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,818
And that's forever.

449
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,069
No matter what happens,

450
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,698
no matter where I hang my bronze booties
and performance awards,

451
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,325
I ride with the babies who got me here.

452
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,870
-[babbles]
-[laughs]

453
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,413
Same to you, Scoot-Scoot.

454
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,125
Now, please, my friend, give me the page.

455
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,460
-[babbles]
-You ate it?

456
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,964
Aaah!

457
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,219
[grunting]

458
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,762
[panting, sighs]

459
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:41,972
Four minutes.

460
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,640
I'm not gonna make it.

461
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,142
[Mega Fat] You know what?

462
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,187
I think I saw my mommy lady
open this one or two times.

463
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,396
[Boss] Are you...

464
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,522
helping me?

465
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,484
I thought going back to Baby Corp
was a huge boo-boo for you-you,

466
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,280
but if you can whip that place into shape
the way you whipped our playgroup

467
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,492
into a Bubbeezee-busting cooly-cool force,
then I was wrong.

468
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,702
Thank you.

469
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,913
I think you have to press that.

470
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,374
-Like this?
-Yep, and then I twist this, and...

471
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,293
Ha ha!

472
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,128
Templeton?

473
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,382
Listen, man, I don't wanna rush you,
but I double-checked the prophecy,

474
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,929
and, yeah, it does say the chosen one's
supposed to be Timothy Leslie--

475
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,305
-[Boss] Templeton!
-Huh?

476
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,015
What the heck?

477
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,517
-You got it open!
-[doorknob rattles]

478
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,063
You truly are a good baby.

479
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,732
-Oh! [cooing]
-[yelps]

480
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,484
[cooing continues]

481
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,194
Seriously, can we go?

482
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,113
We're in a huge interference bubble.

483
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,449
Krinkle's got
this entire neighborhood Bubbeezeed.

484
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,451
-Not our house.
-Go!

485
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,082
-[chirps]
-It's working! Thank you, Templeton!

486
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,084
-Good luck!
-[zaps]

487
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,002
Sorry, kabobs.

488
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,338
[tires screech]

489
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,590
There you are! Hop in!

490
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,550
Why aren't you playing hamburger swords?

491
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,180
Bro, I ride with the bro who reminded me
it was kabob day, always.

492
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,432
One for the road?

493
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,101
En garde!

494
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,398
[elevator bell dings]

495
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,277
[babies gasp]

496
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,196
I-It's Dale from Accounting!

497
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,116
[babies cheering]

498
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,536
You've got, like,
20 seconds till your interview!

499
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,624
Um, my job is on the line
if you don't come back and help me.

500
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,252
But, you know, we still gotta do
this interview, okay?

501
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,920
O-kay.

502
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,755
[clears throat] Okay.

503
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,174
Mmm, here is a question:

504
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,594
what plans do you have
for increasing baby love?

505
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,847
Well, I haven't really thought about it.

506
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,435
Uh, obviously, baby love rises
when babies are happy, so whatever...

507
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,941
[Marsha, echoing] Everything's easy
with Bubbeezee!

508
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,031
We need to take down Bubbeezee.

509
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,158
Whaaat?

510
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,411
They're making babies miserable.

511
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,205
But they're making parents ecstatic.

512
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,250
Bubbeezee's been the best thing
for baby love since spit curls.

513
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,710
You want to take them down?

514
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,171
Is... that a problem?

515
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,382
Can I get you to n-not want
to do that? [chuckles]

516
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,968
Because I can't
