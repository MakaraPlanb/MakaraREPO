Oh! So jealous
Scooter gets to hang with Trav.

173
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh, I see you are jealous, too!

174
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,443
-[starts]
-Or-- Or maybe it's envy.

175
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,278
-Wait-- Yeah, I--
-I always confuse those.

176
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,947
Can you please define the word "envy"
with your body?

177
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,158
Aah! [groans]

178
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,451
[Mrs. Buskie] Oh!

179
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,579
My little Scooter's a star! [laughing]

180
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,790
That came straight
from my friends at Bubbeezee.

181
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,002
Now, it's just a mockup,
but the catalog prints tomorrow,

182
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,629
and that is your cover.

183
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,089
[squeals] I feel like celebrating!

184
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,133
-I'm gonna make fudge!
-[excited chatter]

185
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,761
-Now it's a party!
-Mama does love the fudge.

00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,517
Hooraysies!
Mission accomplished, right?

187
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,977
Now will you tell me
what will happen with baby love

188
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,896
since we got the cover, Boss Baby?

189

00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,815

191
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,985
Pros and cons of the world's worst baby

[sighs] Pros: we did get a baby
on the cover.

195
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,661
Should be good for baby love.

May I ask you
a tiny HR something-something?

199
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,004
Now that Scooter Buskie is so popular,

200
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,299
do we move him up only a few spots
on the org chart

201
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,009
or all the way to head honcho?

202
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,386
We move nothing!

203
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,429
So what if Scooter got the cover page?

204
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,056
I'm still this team's leader.

205
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,184
I think maybe the playgroup
begs, perhaps, to differ.

Listen, Scoot-Scoot.
Can I call you Scoot-Scoot?

00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm concerned this cover photo
is creating some leadership confusion.

211
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,079
Now, I'm sure you don't want
a bunch of babies copycatting you

212
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,831
just as much as I don't want to waste

213
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,792
all the effort I've put into training
this new field team,

214
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:49,130
so let's remind the babies
I'm still top of the org chart, m-kay?

[woman 3] What is wrong with these babies?

00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,381
You still haven't told me what happens
when we have a baby on the catalog cover.

233
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,218
Is the plan that everybody hates babies
and Baby Corp hates you?

234
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,097
Because if so, as your HR rep
and spirit guide to better living,

We can stop the spread of toxic Buskie-ism

under Baby Corp's radar.

Oh, man! It's the doomsday scenario!

00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,489
We got a small army of Scooter Buskies.

-Did we ever come up with a plan for that?
-Sort of.

But I don't think it got
any farther than... [screaming]

was the sun and Earth

called "Planet The Rest of the Planets."

would be any different?

You know that in Brazil,
that one-toothed smile
