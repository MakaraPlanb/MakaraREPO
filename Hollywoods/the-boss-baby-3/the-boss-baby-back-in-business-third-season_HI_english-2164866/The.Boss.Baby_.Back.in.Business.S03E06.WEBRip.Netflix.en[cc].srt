00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:19,272
I like, like, the skin, like,
and the juice coming out of it,

175
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:23,734
'cause I want other people to think
that it's a dog so they can eat it.

176
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,903
[coughs, screaming]

177
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,196
I'm so sorry.

178
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,323
[sighs] Apology accepted.

179
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,575
Accidents happen.

180
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,742
Repeatedly.

181
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,202
At my expense.

182
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,079
-I don't know what's wrong with me!
-Oof! Ow!

183
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,247
[gasps] Sorry!

184
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,710
I don't know either, but for my own
physical and psychological well-being,

185
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,503
you need to go figure it out.

186
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,256
It's good you came to me.

187
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,800
-Um, this is my house.
-Indeed.

188
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,179
Now, let's divine the nature
of your misfortune

189
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,972
with book learning!

190
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,186
On the night of your birth,
did your parents accept a boon

191
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:02,231
offered by a mysterious traveler,
but with a cost?

192
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,484
I assume they would have told me.

193
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:10,031
Have you offended any woodland creatures
who might hold ancient and dire magicks?

194
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,533
You're the one
who whips quarters at squirrels.

195
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,827
Bro, that's between me and the squirrels.

196
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,662
Don't try to make this about me.

197
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,415
Better stockpile some snack rations.

198
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,209
We're gonna be here a while.

199
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,757
And you are sure you never farted
on a black cat under a blood moon?

200
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,134
-Why would I--
-Why anything, Tim?

201
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,345
It's magic!

202
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,555
No! I am positive I didn't.

203
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,974
Maybe I'm just having an unlucky streak.

204
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,185
What?

205
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,231
Do you still have that lucky pencil
my dad sold you?

206
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,192
From the secret Army base
where they study luckular technology?

207
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,276
Yeah, it's right here.

208
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,740
[sniffs]

209
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:58,454
Have you used it
for any unholy or barbaric purposes?

210
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,207
Uh...

211
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,043
[Mega Fat shouts]

212
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,254
[crackling]

213
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,922
...uh...

214
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,423
M-Maybe?

215
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,426
But the robot kangaroo
sort of had it coming.

216
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,514
Bro, there's no
kangaroo justification clause.

217
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,558
You misused an item of fortune.

218
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,894
You caused a "luckular reflux."

219
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,813
The lucky pencil stopped working?

220
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,148
Oh, it works... backwards.

221
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,317
Why do you think you keep
hurting your brother?

222
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,319
That pencil turned on you.

223
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,071
It's bad luck now.

224
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,908
And if you're gonna break this curse,
you need to get rid of it.

225
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,785
[shouts]

226
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,829
Aah!

227
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,374
[laughs] That pencil hates you.

228
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,334
-[babies babbling]
-[Boss] Game plan!

229
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,213
Thanks to my, uh, unexpected
second medical emergency,

230
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,425
I was able to scout out
every aspect of Dr. Kevin's office

231
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,510
that needs a baby-friendly revamp.

232
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,888
I've prepared an itemized list
with priority actionables in--

233
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,558
[babies babbling, shouting]

234
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,060
[Boss groans]
I'll have Mega Fat draw pictures.

235
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,022
[laughs] Oh, you know
I'm down for coloring! What?

236
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,691
[Boss] The more important thing is that.

237
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,859
[Jarreau babbles]

238
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,320
[Tim and Danny grunting]

239
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm not getting any hits! Are you?

240
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,576
[groans] It must have some kind
of protective force field!

241
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,369
Uh, no.

242
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,954
That, over there.

243
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,415
After two doctor visits in one day,

244
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,251
parental guilt at my house
is up 82 percent.

245
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,171
When mommies and daddies
feel like awful parents,

246
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,464
that's bad for baby love.

247
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,673
[babbling]

248
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,801
No, we're still going to overhaul
Dr. Kevin's office.

249
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,345
We just need a new approach.

250
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,306
You ever toss bread
to the duckies at the pond?

251
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,349
Of course you have!

252
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,185
And do the duckies swallow
a whole slice at once?

253
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,354
No. They nibble.

254
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,106
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

255
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,234
You fake sick or injured,
you get taken to Dr. Kevin,

256
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,862
you fix just one small thing
in that office,

257
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,405
and then it's someone else's turn.

258
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,909
Every baby does their part,
and no one mommy and/or daddy

259
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,827
is left feeling too guilty.

260
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,038
Nibble-nibble, quack-quack, poof!

261
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:04,955
All gone, bread.

262
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,999
-[babbles]
-[Boss] Uh, metaphor.

263
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,502
We're wiping out
Dr. Kevin's egregious buffoonery.

264
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,544
[babbles]

265
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,506
No, I don't have actual bread.
Now, who's up first?

266
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,049
Quiet Psycho Baby?

267
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,928
We'll come back to you.
Any volunteers?

268
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,930
[babies babbling]

269
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,434
It's actually helped me a lot.

270
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,019
-Um-- [gasps]
-[sneezes]

271
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,772
-Oh!
-Ooh, I think Taffeta's got bronchitis!

272
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,942
[Mrs. Kurdt] Sign in.

273
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,445
What happened to my Big Book
of 1001 Doctor Jokes?

274
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,239
The pages are all gunked up!

275
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,950
[coos, giggles]

276
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,496
What kind of cruddy library has zero books
on cursed pencil destruction?

277
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,167
Your bravery inspires us all,
Jarreau McIntosh.

278
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,671
-[parents gasping, shouting]
-[librarian] Shh!

00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,966

[preek 2 babbles, grunts]

285
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,102
Mega Fat, you're up.

286
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,479
Fake chicken pox or real diaper rash?

287
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,440
Ooh, surprise me. [coughs]

288
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,109
Oh, pardon me.
I swallowed some spit. [yelps]

289
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,777
To the pediatric ward!

290

-[tires screech]
-[bell jingles]

291
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,575
Please write on your charts
that I am a devoted mother.

292
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,660
Everything in the house
is Bubbeezee-certified,

293
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,245
so you know I'm doing this right, heh.

294
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,165
Have you considered any of their products
for your home or office?

295
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,833
I am an authorized distributor.

296
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,210
Mm, toasty.

297
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,504
How's the parental guilt, Stace?

298
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,505
Any red flags?

299
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,424
Hmm, I'd back off Krinkle.

300
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,260
One doctor visit already freaked her out
pretty hardcore.

301
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,096
My mommy lady loves me the most! I win!

302
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,556
Congratulations!

303
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,850
-Great job! [yelps]
-Aah!

304
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,978
Other than that, keep spreading
the doctor visits around the playgroup,

305
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,897
and no parent should get too stressed.

306
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,356
Maybe give Tim a turn.

307
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,234
-He's otherwise occupied.
-Timbo!

308
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,653
Got a surprise for you!

309
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,407
You accidentally dropped
your pencil in the garbage.

310
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,075
Lucky I found it, huh?

311
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,664
-[Tim screams]
-I love this plan, BB!

312

Got a feeling we'll see you
back here real soon.

313
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,127
Bet on it. Thanks, Stace.

314
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,421
Who's up? Quiet Psycho Baby?

315
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,508
We'll circle back later.

No infection, so those screamy-dreamies
aren't fever related.

Oh, that's a relief.

It's good to get another perspective.
