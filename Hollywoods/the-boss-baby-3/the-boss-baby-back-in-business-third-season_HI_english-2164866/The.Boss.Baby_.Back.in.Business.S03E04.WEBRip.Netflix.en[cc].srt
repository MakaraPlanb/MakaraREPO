Unlikely. What are you doing?

Inventing a homework assassination device.
What are you doing?

18
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,191
Ugh, sadly, nothing.
Playgroup's off for the weekend.

19

Baby misses his 80-hour workweeks.

Two, maybe two and a half hours?

homework in that time?

How many apples does each friend get?"

Zero!

James knows that in a market economy,

30
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,801
giving away apples
to his freeloading buddies distorts the--

00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:33,802
Whoa!

00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,346

43
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,873
What was the board thinking?
G'ah! [thuds]

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,959
Ideas-- you're gonna give me some!

45
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,252
Because you owe me...

46
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,629
[in deep voice] and because you fear me.

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,172
All right.

48
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,135
I was looking for some action anyway,
and we've got the whole weekend to plan.

49
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,177
No, we don't!

50
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,888
She's making us all go
on a company retreat.

51
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,432
Today, on a Saturday?

52
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,226
We have to end this now!

53
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,354
So it's that kind of party! Cool.

54
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,189
We'll need plausible deniability.

55
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,232
I know a baby.

56
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,651
You slip him a name,
he won't ask questions...

57
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,611
because he can't talk.

58
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,365
Which is funny because when he's done,
neither can they.

59
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,867
What? No!

60
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,495
I meant, like, make her leave the CEO job,
go back to sales or whatever.

61
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,540
Nobody does corporate sabotage
like you, Boss.

62
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,585

to flex those muscles.

00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,457
I've been out there on the road, babies,
getting down, the ground level,

91
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,961
where the rug's all sticky,
but sometimes you can find a treat in it.

97
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,681
Coo.

98
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,266
"The Coo."

99
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,811
Can we leave?

100
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,772
"What is the Coo?"
Amazing question, Peg.

101
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,359
You ever crawl and crawl
until you're so pooped,

102
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,653
you can't crawl another crawl?

103
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,904
Yeah...

104
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,197
And then what did you do?

105
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,532
I quit crawling.

106
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,741
No, man!

107
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:48,162
Because the Coo lives on the other side
of where you just quit.

108
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,249
It's a place you can only go in your mind
when you push yourself!

109
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,752
The Coo is the key to your inner babyhood!

110
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,588
Real babies feel the Coo naturally.

111
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,757
You business babies gotta work for it.

112
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,051
So, I made a game,

113
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,887
competitions that will force you
to understand the world

114
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,597
through a real baby's eyes.

115
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,100
You'll get points!
You'll move up the leaderboard!

116
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,186
And the winner's gonna get
what every baby dreams of.

117
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,314
Edible playground sand?

118
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,441
The Golden Rattle.

119
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,989
So, once somebody wins that trophy,
the corporate retreat is over?

120
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,700
-Yes.
-Well, sign me up, yeah.

121
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,785
Yeah, let's get this over with.

122
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,539
-A company-wide competition?
-With a first-place trophy?

123
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,958
She walked herself
right into the granddaddy

124
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,918
of corporate sabotage schemes...

125
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,212
[babies] The Big Manchego.

126
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,924
With a side order of ding-a-linger
paddy whacker smack attack!

127
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,262
I'm just really happy to not be doing
story problems right now.

128
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,348
-Tell me you packed dynamite.
-I never unpack it.

129
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,518
But we also need half a sandwich
cut diagonally.

130
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,772
I didn't know if there'd be
big-kid food here.

131
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,690
[sighs] Ooh, timing's gonna be tight.

132
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,776
Once we win
and she hands over that trophy,

133
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,320
we're gonna have,
what, a five-second window?

134
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,988
I only need three.

135
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:09,327
Oh. So, you're competing for all of us?

136
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,746
Well, I-- I assumed.

137
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,666
I figure our best shot's putting me
out there with a solid support team.

138
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,336
The Big Manchego only works if you win.

139
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,089
Are you sure you can reach this "the Coo"?

140
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,674
[chuckles] The Coo's not a real thing.

141
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,802
And I don't need it. I got this.

142
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,470
[grunting]

143
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,350
Yeah, Jimbo.
If Boss says he's got it, he's got it.

144
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,685
Now, technically,
I'm not supposed to be here.

145
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,687
-Because you got fired?
-Yes.

146
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,773
So I'll need a clever disguise.

147
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,359
Maybe we use my Tsar Nicholas
impression. [chuckles]

148
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,610
It's very convincing.

149
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,528

153

Sure, probably, whatever. Hi, Dale.

154
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,915
I've barely been gone a few weeks!

155
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,667
It's nothing personal, Boss.

156
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,919
They're babies. No object permanence.

157
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,004
I don't buy the--
Ah, where'd the world go?

158
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,631
I still get a disguise, right?

159
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,926
I could be an old robot that farts,
but instead of... [imitates fart]

160
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,512
it sounds like, "Fa-ah-ah-art!"

161

Fine, I'm Dale from Accounting.

162

All the Pegs of the world will eat it up.

the Simmonses and Hendershots, too.
