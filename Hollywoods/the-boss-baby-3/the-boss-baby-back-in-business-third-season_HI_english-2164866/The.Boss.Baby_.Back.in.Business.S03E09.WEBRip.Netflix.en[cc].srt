-Bug the Pug!

[panting, growls]

178
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,705
How come your mommies and daddies
aren't stopping this?

-[Janice] Ooh!
-[Marsha] Wow, look at that!

181
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,586
[Mayor] Whoa, look at that!

182
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:46,257
Puppy, I didn't know you knew
traditional Bavarian folk dance!

183
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,636
It's a convoluted story,
but the less convoluted moral is help me!

184
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,929
[shouts]

185
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,265
Taking this to the top right now!

186
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,767
Bug the Pug?

187
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,728
Forget filling out your start paperwork.

188
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,813
This is now a priority rush mission!

189
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:05,610
Sir, you don't know how refreshing it is
to have a CEO who gets it.

190
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,821
Run off six copies
of the priority rush mission paperwork.

191
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,989
Guh?

192
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,909
"Emergency contact number."

193
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,454
"Emergency contact telegraph"?

194
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,915
[screams] Yeh!

195
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,291
[growls]

196
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,335
You gonna give me a hand on this?

197
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,795
I would if I could,
but Buddy said I can't.

198
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,839
[whimpering] Here.

199
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,926
"Due to acute cookie wrist..."?

200
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,136
Buddy bought that coo-coo hooey?

201
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
[gasps] Wait!

202
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,640
That's how I get out of paperwork!

203
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,600
[laughs] With hooey!

204
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,520
It's not hooey!

205
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,524
[straining]

206
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,234
Got an idea, BB.

207
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,152
I'll be there
in the flick of a cookie wrist.

208
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,071
That's confusing, but thank you.

209
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,197
We're already-- Ah!

-You seem angry.
-[growls, whimpers]

216
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,878
Tell me your emotions,
I'll tell you mine.

217
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,964
We'll take the journey
to wholeness together.

218
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,715
Mega Fat, what are you doing?

219
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,469
Fighting this puppy
by challenging its preconceptions about--

220
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,471
-[Mega Fat grunts]
-This is a dog fight!

221
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,599
They understand alpha dominance,
not emotional nuance!

-[puppies barking]

223

-[growling]
-But I'm a, oof, good baby now.

224
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,440
You know how I said sometimes you've gotta
forget about being a good baby?

225
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,943
This is one of those times! [grunts]

226
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,945
But that's not me anymore! [grunts]

227
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,031
I left the old... naughtiness behind!

228
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,325
-[barks]
-How about a pinch of mischievousness?

229
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,660
Just to even the playing field.

230
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,620
A skosh of shenanigans?

231
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,122
-[barks]
-Yah! [grunts]

232
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,915
A thimble of disobedience.

233
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,459
Are you sure it's okay? [gasps]

234
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,086
[Marsha] Wowie!

235
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,298
He's also mastered the ancient mysteries
of the belly dance!

236
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,093
Even my baby could learn a thing or two
from this frisky Fido.

237
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,847
Oh, you are not stealing the affections
of my mommy lady.

238
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,726
We are doing this naughty,
bad boy style right now!

00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,440
That's Spanish for
"you're embarrassing yourself," yes.

[snarling]

243
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,651
-Ooh, wait. That's your tail?
-[whimpers]

244
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,570
I know puppies don't have
opposable thumbs,

245
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,156
but I didn't know you just put them
on your butt-butts.

246
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,657
[whimpering]

247
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:21,162
Ha ha! There's the Mega Fat
who made my life unbearably miserable.

248
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,997
I-- I'm doing good?

249
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,999
Oh, yes! Ha ha!

250
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:30,087
Since when are you a "No-paperwork-ist,"
and since-- What is that?

251
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,674
No-paperwork-ism is a movement
that values human interaction

252
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:38,179
over forms, memos, or anything else
that could be deemed "printer speak."

253
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,348
Uh, sir, I need you to sign this.

254
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,268
[screaming] Ew! Aah!

255
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,978
I guess that checks out.

256
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,229
Glad you understand,

257
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,232
and thank you for excusing me
from all paperwork for life.

258
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,150
Bye!

259
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,903

[Staci] Let's rough up some pups.

261
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,157
We heard about No-paperwork-ism.

262
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,534
Wow! She's so committed!

263
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,994
Teach us your ways!

264
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,788
Ha! Good one, guys.

265
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,750
-No-paperwork-ism isn't real...
-Hmmmm?

266
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,710
...ly easy.

267
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,213
You have to fully commit to the cause!

268
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,589
So, you will teach us?

269
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,758
Yes?

Tide's turned, Bug the Pug.

277
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,528
Unless you've got something
that can compete with that.

280
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,328
Oh, you actually do.

281
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,081
Ohhh!

282
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,334
Is-- Is that the Collar of Shame?

283
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,003
Puppykind's greatest weapon.

284
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,091
Some say the collar was forged
deep in the fiery heart

285
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,801
of Mount Doggy Diggety Bone.

286
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,720
Some say it was left behind
by an alien species

287
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,640
known for being
another species' best friend.

288
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,227
But while its origin is unclear,
its power is not.

289
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,145
[puppy panting]

290
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,688
-Off my horse, puppy.
-[yelps]

291
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,481
I've got a rebellion to crush.

292
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,649
-[barks]
-Oh!

293
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,818
[Boss] Anyone who wears
the Collar of Shame

294
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,238
quickly finds their lives
and legacies destroyed.

295
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,367
General Washington,
I shamefully surrender.

296
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,035
You win America.

-[soldiers] Hooray!

That physicist who solved the equation
for faster-than-light travel,

300
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,670
but forgot to feed his dog.

301
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,380
-What physicist?
-Exactly!

302
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,177
One of us is ending this duel
with that collar on his neck,

303
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,180
a ruined future, and a lifetime of shame.

304
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,264
[growls]

305
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,516
No, you're gonna be wearing it.

306
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,602
Final showdown.

307
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,563
Call off your dogs,
and I'll call off my babies.

308
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,107
This was always going to come down
to you and me, Pug.

309

[snarling]

310
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,778
As a recently reawakened naughty boy,
I feel obligated to say,

311
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,071
"Yes, fight! Do it!"

312
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,198
Uh, not here.

313
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,450
Can't have the parents witnessing
these fireworks.

314
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,243
Behind those trees?

315
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,704
-[grunts]
-Mega Fat, you're in charge.

316
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:13,042
Hold the cease-fire until I return
with a humiliated, collar-wearing pug.

317
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,793
So, like, 15 seconds.

318
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,629
You can count on me...

319
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:21,342
to not listen to you because I'm naughty
again and rules are lame! Wah!

320
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,181
The movement is growing!

321
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,349
What movement?

322
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,100
Oh, right!

323
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,353
[chuckles] No-paperwork-ism.

324
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,437
Boo, paperwork.

325
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,356
You're doing great. Gotta go!

326
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,900
-Don't you want to address everyone?
-About what?

327
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,361
The No-paperwork-ist manifesto!

328
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,196
What do we believe in?

329
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,574
Uh, the manifesto is...

330
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,743
no... paperwork?

331
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,831
-[all cheering]
-Great manifesto!

332
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,875
Cool. Jimbo and I gotta run, but--

333
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,127
[babies chanting] Hip hip no paperwork!

Hip hip no paperwork!

-No, no!

-Oh, adorable!
-Oh, aren't y'all precious?

358
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,455
[all chanting] No paperwork!
No paperwork!

359
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,666
Reasonable amounts of paperwork
for a busy company!

360
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,961
Reasonable amounts of paperwork
for a busy company!

361
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,796
Just fess up and do the paperwork.

362
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,467
You have to end this made-up revolution
so we can help the boss.

363
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,510
[gasps] You're right!

364
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,013
Yo, Hendershot, toss me that bottle!

365
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,098
What are you doing?

366
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,935
Ending this made-up revolution...

367
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,561
by winning it.

368
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,023
No-paperwork-ists forever!

369
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,234
It's all soaked!

370
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,528
You monsters!

389
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,789
[sighs] You seem tired.

390
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,792
What are your thoughts on a... [coughing]

391
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,544
snack-time break in hostilities?

392
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,338

-[squeals]
-No, no, no, no, no, I don't need one.

394
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,219

what you used to be, so if you want one...

[babbles]

401
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,565
Under attack? From who, the puppies?

402
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,609
-We had a cease-fire deal.

-What about Mega Fat?
-[babbling]

405
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,658
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How naughty are we talking?

[Mega Fat laughing]

408
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,831
Yes! Serve me! Fetch me treats!

409
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:25,002
Chomp and slobber on all who oppose me,
for I am your pack leader!

410
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,879

[munching]

412
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,468
I can't help but feel, like, seven
or eight percent responsible for this.

413
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,304
And I'm gonna end it.

414
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,308
-Hey! I said I was gonna end it!
-[growling]

415
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,518
You're a washed-up has-been
who lost his own team.

416
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,562
Now, give me! [groaning]

418
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,028
Son of a Bichon Frise, he did it!

419
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,864
Oh, no! The Collar of Shame.

420
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,492
I guess that means I'm done being naughty?

421
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,162
[inhales, straining]

422
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,246
Yah!

423
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,874
Silly puppy!

424
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,542
You can't shame the shameless.

425
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,378
[puppies growling]

426
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,380
You liberated me, Boss Baby.

427
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,383
I should say "thank you,"

428
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,594
but naughty babies don't use
polite words,

429
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,054
so... [blows raspberry] to you.

430
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,806
But you like being good!

431
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,934
-[puppies whimpering]
-Do I? Being good is so tiring.

432
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:22,851
And you know why?

433
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,854
Because goodness
is not baby's true essence.

434
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,233
Naughtiness is as natural
as the air we breathe,

435
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,360
as the toots our tushies toot.

436
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,028
I choose nature.

437
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,072
I choose naughtiness!

Final offer: you do half your paperwork,
we'll forget about the other half.

00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,252
-Mmm...
-[babies whispering]

443
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,839
[giggles] Counteroffer:
we keep all the paperwork

444
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,841
and just outsource it to Buddy from HR.

445
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,384
-Deal!
-What?

446
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,303
[babies chanting] Hip hip no paperwork!

447
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,305
-Hip hip no paperwork!
-[groans]

448
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:05,144
It's with a heavy heart that I announce
my resignation as CEO

449
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,230
so I can focus my efforts on paperwork.

450
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,274
Love you guys!

[sniffing]

454
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,955
Yes, butt scoot for my amusement! [laughs]

455
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,373
[munches] Oh!

456
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,376
-[barks]
-Yeah, I'm out of options, too.

457
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,712
I guess neither one of us
is what we used to be.

458
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,629
[Pug grunts]

459
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,842
Did you just have the same idea I did?

460
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,552
[panting, grunting]

461
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,761
What? No!

462
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,680
Why would we try to lick off
our own stitches?

463
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,764
You're disgusting.

464
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,682
Huh?

465
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,642
We're not what we used to be.

466
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,604
I don't work for Baby Corp,
you don't work for Puppy Co.

467
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,647
So, why keep doing things their way?

468
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,983
Mega Fat's not playing by the rules.

469
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,277
Let's break a few ourselves.

470
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,486
We work together!

473
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,952
Is there any dance this pupper
doesn't know?

474
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,665
All clear on the plan?

Hey, I said stop!

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,818
Oh, you're so annoying.

486
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,071
Hey, you think I won't backslap
a puppy dog?

487
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,989
I'll do it, man. I'm a bad boy.

488
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,116
You just keep pushing and find out!

489
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,160
Do you not hear me warning you?

490
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,705
Oh, snap, there goes my self-control!

You asked for this! Hoo-cha!

494
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,672
[Marsha gasps] Baby, no!

495
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,799
Wha...? Oh, what?

496

-Who headbutts a puppy? [gasps]
-[Pug whimpering]

497
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,887
Mommy lady...

498
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,764
What have I done?

499
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,269
[Marsha] I don't know
why my baby did that.

500
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,896
I'm so... disappointed!

501
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,610
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have pushed you.

502
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,488
I was already falling.

503
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,286
Maybe it's time we close
the chapter on this party.

504
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,537

-I'll be all right.

506
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,748
I just hope he is.

507
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,584
So... we fighting again, or...?

[snarling]

509
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,588
Anytime, anyplace.

510
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,674
-But until then...
-[chupie zaps]

511
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,885
[panting] BB, we're finally here!

[loud gasp]

513
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,058
Uh, Staci! Let me explain! [yelps]

514
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,479
[Janice] Oh, I know you love the puppy,
but that's enough fun for one day.

515
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,859
First, he's anti-Bubbeezee.
Now he's working with puppies?

516
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,861
He's lost it, man.

517
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,279
Cancel the intervention.

518
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,281
This just became an operation.

519
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,575
We have to stop Boss Baby.

520
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,577
[gasping]

521
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,705
Hey, my cookie wrist is better!

[munching, giggling]

523
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,169
I don't know what's gonna happen
to Mega Fat

524
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,088
and I don't know what's gonna happen
with Staci and Jimbo,

00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,675
but I do know it's time
to throw out the old rule book.

526
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,385
I'm done playing defense.

527
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,930
We're going after Bubbeezee,
and we're going right to the top!

528
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,683
So, the only question
we should be asking is,

529
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,394
"Who's in charge of Bubbeezee?"

530
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,939

-Also a good question.

531
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,567
It's the weekend.
What has Tim been doing all day?

532
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,777
I met a hippo!
