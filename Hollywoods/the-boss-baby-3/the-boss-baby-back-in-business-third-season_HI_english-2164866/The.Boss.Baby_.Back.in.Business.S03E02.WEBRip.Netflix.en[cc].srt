00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,104
They're already planning today's activity.

173
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,773
If we're going to that museum,
we have about a three-minute window

174
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,275
to plant the idea.

175
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,778
Which is why we must be
the "gardeners of suggestion."

176
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,948
There has to be someplace
we can take the kiddos.

177
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,492
[bangs]

178
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,705
-I've got it!
-[gasps]

179
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,833
We could go to Chummy Farms
for a baby hayride!

180
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,921
[woman] Ooh, I heard a kid lost a finger
in the donkey's mouth.

181
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,464

182

185
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,143
[sniffles]

186
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,687
What if we spent the day...

187
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,022
[gasps]

188
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,649
Never mind, lost it.

189
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,193
[groans, thumps] Oh-hh!

190
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,529
Do it.

191
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,281
-[puffs]
-Have you-- huh?

192
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,787
Maybe the museum?

193
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,413
-[Marsha] The museum!
-[man] Oh, I'd love that!

194
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,249
-[woman] Yes!
-[man] I've got an annual pass!

195
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,253

-[parents grumbling]

196

-[man] Hurry up in there!
-[giggles]

197
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,676
Oh, it says there's a very good movie
about the history of the museum.

198
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,843
Any takers?

199
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,804
"Narrated by Marsha Krinkle"?

200
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,722
Sounds compelling! I'm in!

201
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,353
[program music playing]

202
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,648
Hi, Marsha Krinkle, Channel 8 News.

203
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,608
[softly] "Welcome to the town museum,

204
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,487
a place with a story captivating enough
to hang on its own walls."

205
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,405
So good.

206
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,491
[Marsha narrating] Thomas Kulkelka--
entrepreneur, collector.

207
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,494
Toured every inch of this globe
with a zest for life in his gut

208
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,454
and a wooden kazoo in his mouth.

209
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,498
-It was Kulkelka who built this museum...
-[fingers snap]

210
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,292
[narration continues]
...with his bare hands.

211
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,129
That was the third time
Thomas Kulkelka wrestled a bear.

212
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,839
-The fourth was at a circus.
-[Jarreau moans]

213
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,424
-[thumping]
-[babies wailing]

214
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,217
[monitor chimes]

215
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,219
-Talk to me.
-Clock's ticking, boss.

216
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,930
Not sure how long
we can occupy Scary Sweary.

217
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,558
He's not exactly the relaxing type.

218
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,436
Focus on the sound of your breath.

219
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,563
Then stop [babbles] talking!

220
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,565
Just hang on. We're almost there.

221
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,735
All right, we got a family bathroom
that needs evacuating.

222
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,070
-Mega Fat, you create a diversion.
-Check.

223
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,573
Also, check in. How are you doing?

224
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,618
The rest of you, since it's your
first mission, you'll be on lookout.

225
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,536
[Boss Baby]
We'll use these for communication.

226
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,204
[slurps]

227
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,832
Once Mega Fat clears the way,
I'll swoop in

228
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:29,295
and evict that bathroom bandit
with the power of negotiation.

229
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,849
Oh-hh!

230
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,559
[Mega Fat humming]

231
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,693
-[squeaks]
-[baby whines]

232
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,445
Let's keep it moving, folks.

233
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,532
-The art's for looking, not for touching!
-That's the family bathroom!

234
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:03,329
Says here it's a piece called
"The Door" by Meg O' Fat.

235
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,872
[camera shutter clicks]

236
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,625
Need the family bathroom?
Follow the sign.

237
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,044
-[man] It's okay, kids.
-[parents grumbling]

238
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,758
Ninety seconds of negotiation starts...

239
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,760
[crackles] now.

240
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,428
[thumps]

241
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,639
Before we get into this song-and-dance,

242
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,349
you should know who I am.

243
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,684
Just call me "someone."

244
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,895
Someone who doesn't give an inch,

245
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,438
someone who takes no prisoners,

246
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,484
someone who forced himself to like pizza
topped with clams and wet lettuce

247
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,319
so no one else would ever want a slice.

248
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,030
Just someone on the other side
of this door...

249
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,866
[tapping]
waiting and wondering...

250
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,868
what kind of someone are you?

251
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,745
[voice yells] Give me candy!

252
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,665
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah!
-Fart-poop doody!

253
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,166
It's a "preek"!

254
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,626
[yells] Bagel!

255
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,086
[babbling]

256
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,588
I'm not good at standing on one foot.

257
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,298
-[Boss Baby] We got a pre-kindergartner--
-[grunting]

258
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,301
the most irrational, scatterbrained,
never-can-be-reasoned-with species

259
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,761
on the face of the earth!

260
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,638
[Mega Fat] A preek? Eh, we tried.

261
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,223
Time to go home and take naps.

262
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,892
I like to think of failures
as learning punches.

263
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,019
[Mega Fat]
So, in one sense, this journey--

264
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,480
New terms.
I will give you anything you want--

265
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,482
toy helicopters, real helicopters,

266
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,610
a group of islands in the South Pacific
shaped like helicopters!

267
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,112
[parents' voices overlapping]

268
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,948
-[yelps] Agh!
-[monitor chimes]

269
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,409
Yo, boss, baby love's still dropping.

270
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,704
Need me to come down and "break
some anks" or "purp some nurps"?

271
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,373
-Under control.
-[preek] Go away, dog! I hate you!

272
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,916
Who was that?

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,793
Did you say "who"?

274
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,796
"Who." I said "who." Who! Who?!

275
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,048
[chuckles]
You babies got an owl up there?

276
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,176
Was that a "dad joke"?

277
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,344
[gasps] You only tell dad jokes
when you're lying!

278
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,263
[stammers] I-- I am not lying.

279
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,557
But if I was lying on the floor,
you could call me Matt.

280
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,476
-See? I told you.
-All right, fine!

281
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,269
It's a preek in the bathroom.

282
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,270
A preek?

283
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,272
You say [babbles] preek?

284
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,899
Corkscrew moonsault!

285
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,983
-[grunts]
-Ugh!

286
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,402
Oh, yeah, you got massaged!

287
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,570
I'm coming down to help.

288
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,030
I don't need help!

289
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,907
Every team needs this moment, Stace.

290
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,202
The moment when they're up against a wall
and somehow find a way to overcome.

291
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:10,080
Well, you have less than a moment
to flush that stinkin' preek!

292
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,709
"Flush that stinkin' preek." That's it!

293
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,961
[Mega Fat] And you know what?
I'm a happy baby

294
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,922
because of that self-discovery.

295
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,381
-Does that make sense?
-Uh, sure.

296
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,591
Listen up, everyone.

297
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,927
We're gonna smoke the preek out
with a diaper bomb.

298

Hello? Anyone?
[taps]

300
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,559
Also, sometimes a self-discovery
is about discovering

301
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,686
that everyone's abandoned the mission.

302

I'm TV's Marsha Krinkle,

305
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,447
and I want you to notice how the artist
subtly used a dripping technique

306
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,991
to symbolize the bleeding soul.

307
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:47,910
Come on!

00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,204
