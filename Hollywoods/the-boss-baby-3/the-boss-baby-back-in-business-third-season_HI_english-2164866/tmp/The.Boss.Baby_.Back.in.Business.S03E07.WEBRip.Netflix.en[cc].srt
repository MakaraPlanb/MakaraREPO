You're looking good.

Jailbird...

348
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,055
[growls] Exactly what I would have done.

00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:31,972
[Buskie shouts]

350
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,183
No luck on the Buskie approach.

351
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,559
Anyone else have ideas?

352
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,567
Then what's the card reader for,
decoration?

353
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,361
But thank you. Move in!

354
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,615

-Time to call it a night.

00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,785
Also, do you hear a romantic Cuban bolero?

356
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,289
¡Ay, qué cosa!

357
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,540
Look over yonder.

358
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,376
Yonder?

359
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,711
We have to, um...

360
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,129
hit that house?

361
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,383
I didn't have it on my checklist.

362
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,593
Because...

363
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,303
i-it's a secret!

364
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,389

homemade popcorn balls

365

and rolled in cookie crumbs.

366
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,185
Okay, one more.

367

Oh, you are very welcome, candy Romeo.

Au contraire, Dakota.

It's brilliant.

377
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,311
That whole Babblist gimmick was a setup!

378
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,064
Sure, we busted his act
on live television,

379
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,191
but what were the consequences, really?

380
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,194
A phony apology
and a boatload of free Bubbeezee swag

381
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,946
in homes across town!

382
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,615
The man's a diabolical genius.

383
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,411

up my sleeve.

So, at last it's come to this--
once workplace acquaintances,

390
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,350
then associates, then friends,
now enemies.

391

I've got a plan here, Stace.

394
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,817
Then let me guess--
your ultimate weapon...

395
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,405
is to violate Baby Corp's number one rule
by revealing yourself as a talking baby,

396
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,949
snapping that guy's brain
like a toothpick

397
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,577
because grownups
can't handle that knowledge,

398
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,953
and... [imitates explosion]

399
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,123
Happy goes loony, Bubbeezee goes down,

400
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,000
Baby Corp be darned.

401
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,669
That... actually is my plan.

402
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,796
How did you figure it out?

403
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,548
Because it's exactly what I would do.

404
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,134

in a spooky office building unsupervised.

Well, you learn something new every--
Wait, you're daycare Brayden?

00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:34,339

from, um... Danny Petrosky,

00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,176
who heard it from a squirrel?

431

What do I say?

435
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,270
Tell your Paraguayan paramour the truth.

-It will set you free.
-Are you crazy?

Marisol will hate me forever,

and Mom and Dad will never trust me again!

because I wanted to spend
more time with you. [groans]

called "Wigula, the monster with a wig,"

because I didn't have any ideas,
