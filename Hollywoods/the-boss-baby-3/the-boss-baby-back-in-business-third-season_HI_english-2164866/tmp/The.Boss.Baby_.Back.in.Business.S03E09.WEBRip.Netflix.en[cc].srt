we care about making sense.

28
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:50,527
As a mother and Bubbeezee sales rep,
my only comment is, "Thanks!"

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,987
But as an award-winning journalist
who helped bust you

30
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,783
for pretending to talk to babies,
I have to ask, "What the heck, man?"

31
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,993
And I also have a follow-up: How dare you?

32
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,287
Was I an impish rascal? [laughs]

33
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,665
Yes, guilty as Hector's dolphin!

34
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,917
But I knew in my heart
that Bubbeezee products

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,460
would help mums and dads everywhere.

36
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,295
And if the best way to market
those products

37
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,299
was to send out free samples as an apology
for endorsing a phony Babblist,

38
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,469
who also happened to be me,
honestly, who can judge?

39
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,846
Not this reporter!

40
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,515
And I'm sure every other parent
would agree!

00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,517
Is everything still okay out there?

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,434
Yes, ma'am.

00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,561
Thanks, Bubbeezee!

So... [chuckles]

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,319
anybody have a funny story
about something their baby did recently?

46
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,908
Wanna get out of here?

47
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,827
I can tell Mom
I'm taking you home for a nap,

48
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,414
but, really, we'll go do something cool
or dangerous for baby love or whatever.

49
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,291
No, thank you. I'm good.

50
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,919
-Really?
-Let's be the best baby a baby can be!

00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,505
Amen, Wagby. High-five.

-That's not even a high-five!
-It's the baby-safe version.

Hello, Boss Baby, my good boy baby friend!

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,311
Would you like for me to come over later
and we can play Wagby's Hooray?

56
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,438
That sounds real good.

but check me out now.

-Look at him.

You know he's been seeking his purpose
ever since Baby Corp fired him,

64
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,542
and he's finally found it:

65
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,879
being a no-fuss, no-sass,
professional good baby!

66
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,756
His journey is complete.

But check this out.

00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,143
I ran simulations
to predict future baby love,

and every single time...

00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,950
But I know this much--
Bubbeezee is bad for babies.

129
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,452
I told you so!

130
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,330
Is that really the best use
of our time right now?

131
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,667
Yes, but we also need
to stop Bubbeezee-- I told you so--

132
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,585
while we can still save baby love.

133
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,587
Flip it back on the rewind. What?

134
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,758
Your plan is to save baby love by stopping
the thing that's boosting baby love?

-[alarm blares]
-Whoa!

136
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,554
Imagine that's Marsha Krinkle's love
for you.

00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,013
I would prefer not to, thank you.

138
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,641
We don't stop Bubbeezee,
that crash is coming.

139
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,518
The only question that matters is,

140
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,771
don't you believe she'll still love you
without Bubbeezee?

141
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,607
Hmm, uh... probably?

142
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,777
Cool. So, we know
where Happy Sedengry's office is,

143
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,156
and I know the seven weakest spots
on the human body.

[wicked chuckle]

145
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,117
How many are on the butt?

146

-[yelps]
-Uh, tempting, but, no.

147
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,247
The last time I confronted Happy directly,

148
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,084
I woke up back in my crib ten hours later
with no memory of how I got there.

149
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,963
I don't know how that happened,
and what I don't know scares me.

150
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,214
We need a different approach.

151
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,342
As long as this approach
does not involve Wagby slaughter,

152
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,012
which your smile already tells me it does.

153
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,055
Happy's only in this for the money,

154
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,935
so we hit him where it really hurts:
right in the balance sheet.

155
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,480
We're gonna bust up some Bubbeezee toys.

156
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,482
Won't the moms and dads
just get replacements?

157
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,192
I'm counting on it.

158
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:09,071
Here's the play: since these products
are all brand-new and under warranty,

159
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,239
they'll get replaced...

160
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,117
and it'll cost Bubbeezee
every single time.

161

[cash register dinging]

162
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,664

to wrecking Bubbeezee products

completely out of business.

And as a win-win bonus,

166
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,634
we'll be liberating other babies
from Bubbeezee's grip,

167
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,304
building an underground revolution
one baby at a time.

-No Brayden.

But he's our shover!

You don't jump into a revolution
without a shover.

which I do not want to talk about.

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,193
What about Jimbo?

173
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,778
He could shove whatever needs shoving,

174
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,738
and you said he runs
the whole company now.

175
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,616
I wouldn't count on Baby Corp
being much help.

176
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,993
They're not great
at facing reality these days.

177
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,538
-[dance music plays]
-Everything's gonna be great forever!

178
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,873
-[babies cheering]
-And I love everybody!

179
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,167
He says exactly what I wanna hear.

180
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,544
That's leadership!

181
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,837
I'm gonna send him a thank-you memo.

182
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,839
We're already understaffed, Stace.

183
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,093
Baby Corp's out,
Templeton's got school for half the day.

184
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,011
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

185
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,138
[scoffs] Oh, you can have Brayden...

186
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,807
or you can have me.

187
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,058
Not both!

188
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,311
[growls] All right, we'll make it work
with what we have.

189
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,357

00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,367
Yes! Buskie's back, baby.

195
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,336
Hello? Aah!

196
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,471
Whoo!

-[phones ringing]
-Hello? Hello?

201
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,362
[Doug] I hope these ones last longer.

202
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,324
This is the third time
I've needed replacements this week,

203
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,909
and it's a dangerous world out there.

204
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,455
I get so stressed Taffy's gonna be injured
or fall behind socially while I'm waiting.

205
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,665
Me, too. Where's the reliability?

206
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,126
Honestly, Janice and I are thinking
of getting out

207
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,754
of the Bubbeezee product system
altogether.

208
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,632
I am loving this new team, BB.

209
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,717
You babies are my kind of psychopaths.

210
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,885
[babies cooing]

211
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,054
Hello! I'm on television.

212
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,514
-Happy Sedengry, Bubbeezee Corporation.
-[snoring]

213
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,557
Pleasure.

214
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,769
You've heard a fair bit about us recently,
and not all good...

215
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,940
which is why I've paid a pretty penny
for TV airtime to tell you this:

216
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,860
we at Bubbeezee
are aware of the problem

217
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,904
and exactly what's causing it.

218
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,701
So, rest easy knowing I've already handled
everything through exciting upgrades

219
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,536
to our Bubbeezee products!

220
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,288

00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,948
[gasping] What the hoo-hah was that?

238
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,033
And why wouldn't it go after me?

239
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,993
We've all been busting up Bubbeezee stuff.

240
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,622
-[babbling]
-Joy's right!

241
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,332
Happy knows we're wrecking his products,

242
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,960
but the only part of our crew
he's actually seen

243
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,838
are the ones who infiltrated
his office on Halloween.

244
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,298
No Hendershot, no Mega Fat or Staci...

245
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,342
but, yes, Shover!

246
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,385
We have to rescue him.

247
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,929
[groaning]

248
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,389
Fine!

249
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,270
[crying softly]

250
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,106
[Staci] Hunh-yah!

251
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,989
Just because you're alive
does not mean we're friends again.

252
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,367
You wanna tell me what that's all about?

253
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,744
[whimpers]

254
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,205

256
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,322
Nah, dude.

257
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,365
[rattling]

258
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,369
Ugh, anybody got a pencil to shove
through that thing's mechanical heart?

259
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,247
-Always!
-[Happy] Aw, gruesome!

260
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,833
-I just wanted to have a chin-wag.
-Happy...

261
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,711
You're Clangclang
the Rhythm Bear-or-Monkey?

262
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,088
[Happy] What? No. It's a speaker.

263
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,467
Are you just regular dumb babies
who stumbled upon the power of speech?

264
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,095
-Because I was under the impression--
-We're chin-wagging, so wag it.

265
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,430
Ooh, straight to business.

266
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,433
Yeah, just wanted to play
a little message for you.

267
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,936
[Boss] Right now your mind
is splitting in two,

268
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,938
synapses firing on all cylinders.

269
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,273
Pow, zap, boom. Don't fight it.

270
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,150
[gasps] Halloween night.

271
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,736
-He must've recorded--
-[Happy] Full security video, actually.

272
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,030
Got an extra copy if you'd like me
to share with anyone.

273
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,365
Say, your mum and dad?

274
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,575
-[gasps]
-Ooh, wait a minute.

275
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,162
Didn't you say seeing a talking baby
would snap a grown-up's brain?

276
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,081
Probably worse if it's your own kid, eh?

277
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,375
All right, Happy,
you've made your threat, now--

278
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,460
No, I'm making you an offer.

279
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,214
I'll leave your family
and your wee playmates alone forever.

280
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,884
All you have to do is muscle up
and meet me face-to-face.

281
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,386
[all gasp]

282
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,973
I don't have to say out loud
that's a terrible idea, right?

283
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,891
I assumed that's what
we were all thinking,

284
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,269
but then nobody said anything
and it got weird.

285
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,937
Offer accepted.

286
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,613
Get comfy.

287
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,782
I want to know everything.

288
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,910
[Boss] Uh, well, not forever forever.

289
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,747
We only stay like this as long as we drink
Baby Corp's special formula.

290
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,832
Whoa, hang about.

291
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,751
A few minutes ago,
you said you got fired from Baby Corp.

292
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,337
How are you still a talking smart baby
without the formula?

293
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,173
They give us a six-month supply
in the severance package.

294
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,884
We call it a "creamy parachute."

295
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,260
Ah, good as gold.

296
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,304
So I'll have
a bit shy of six months, yeah?

297
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,640
-For what?
-Well, take a ganza for yourself.

298
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,810
Future home of Bubbeezee Worldwide.

299
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,440
Is that supposed to be me?

300
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,985
Imagine the sales after six months
with my new corporate mascot.

301
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,862
He responds to verbal commands.

302
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,739
He solves complex math problems.

303
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,241
And doesn't he look spiffy
in that business suit?

304
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,492
Too flash!

305
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:15,039
And the sweetest part is how easy it is
bending simple babies like you to my will.

306
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,290
Like to know how I do it?

307
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,875
Nah, I'm good.

308
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,460
You mind if I color?

309
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,382
Look, I-I've prepared
a very dramatic presentation here,

310
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,635
and, frankly, it's quite rude
you keep interrupting--

311
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,969
Here's the thing, chief.

312
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,598
I don't need to know the trick
because I know what's behind it:

313
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,851
nothing but plain, ordinary fear.

314
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
No, it isn't.

315
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,521
It's your whole business model.

316
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,275
You make parents afraid
their babies will get hurt,

317
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,403
or they won't grow up smart enough,
or a million other fears.

318
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:50,157
You claim your products will fix it all,
but you can't, really,

319
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,785
because babies aren't easy.

320
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,036
They're unpredictable.

321
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,746
Life is unpredictable.

322
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,749
And the only thing any of us can do
is square up,

323
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,293
look our fears in the eyes
and tell them...

324
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,338
you don't get to run my life.

325
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,382
Aah! Outside the lines!

326
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,467
I don't care what your trick was.

327
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,053
-We're not afraid of you anymore.
-[thudding]

328
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,806
-Or your driver, for that matter.
-[muffled groaning]

329
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,270
Now, pack up your phony business
and get out of my--

330
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,397
-Oh!
-[crashes]

331
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,983
[steam hissing]

332
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,611
Who taught you babies how to drive?

333
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,947
Where's Happy?

334
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,491
Ooh, bad luck on your crash site, eh?

335
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,494
Offer's still on the table, Boss Baby.

336
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:39,415
You can come work for Bubbeezee,
or Bubbeezee can come for you.

337
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,459
-Bloop.
-[gears whirring]

338
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,632
-[beeps]
-[gears whirring]

339
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,929
New toys.

340
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,514
Let's play.

341
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,057
-Hyah!
-[babies shouting]

342
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,268
[squealing]

343
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,230
[grunts, giggling]

344
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,942
Scramble! Keep him confused!

345
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,068
G'ah!

346
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,821
-[Hendershot] I'm a distraction!
-[Dakota shouts]

347
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,323
[grunting] Hyah!

348
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,160
[Staci continues grunting]

349
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,038
Hyaw! [shouting]

350
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:20,956
[Staci] Yah!

351
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,876
Brayden!

352
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,295
Come on, man!

353
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,047
Stay with me, Brayden!

354
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,757
You have to wake up.

355
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,177
There's-- there's something
I gotta tell you.

356
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,725
You deserve that.

357
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,768
[growls]

358
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,979
-How we doing, Boss?
-Not great.

359
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,814
-[loud humming]
-Our babies are overmatched.

360
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,899
We need reinforcements.

361
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,984
-[Tim shouting]
-[bike bell rings]

362
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,527
[Boss and Staci] Yah!

363
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,364
[powers down]

364
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,535
-[laughter]
-[overlapping voices] Yeah!

365
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,996
I saw the big cyclops dinosaur thing
from school

366
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,457
and figured you could use some help,
probably lots,

367
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,876
so I've also been sending live video.

368
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,337
Triplets, you're in charge while I'm gone.

369
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,923
-Temporary promotion?
-[Triplets] Yay!

370
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,967
My best friends are in trouble,
and I miss them!

371
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,596
So let's do something nuts!

372
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,349
[babies shouting]

373
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,101
[thuds]

374
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,061
[toys power down]

375
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:30,109
Hello! Yes, I know I haven't talked
in a bit, but, uh, whoo-hoo, still here.

376
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,985
Honorable move, Happy.

377
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,321
I respect a man who knows when he's beat.

378
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,116
This? Yeah, nah, hardly a surrender, mate.

379
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,660
I've just been stalling
till the real threat gets here.

380
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,912
-[parents shouting]
-Where are you guys? Where are they?

381
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,374
[Doug] The call said they'd been spotted
in that construction site.

382
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,751
[Boss] Right now,
your mind is splitting in two.

383
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,338
-Synapses firing--
-[Happy] You all work for Bubbeezee now.

384
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,423
Or I show this talking baby video,

385
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,094
and your mummies' and daddies' brains
go skip-skapety-scoopety...

386
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,053
[blows raspberry]

387
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,680
[Tim] Go! We gotta hide!

388
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,599
Well, you know where to find me
if you want to stop the madness.

389
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,725
[Marsha] Happy?

390
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,352
Uh, have you seen our babies?

391
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,063
Oh, nothing more important
than our loved ones, eh?

392
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,024
Oh, hello. Maybe there's a clue
on this tape I discovered.

393
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,401
Hmm...

394
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,443
[babbling]

395
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,279
We can't just surrender!

396
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:19,074
If we give in to Happy's blackmail,
he'll use us to take Bubbeezee global.

397
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,034
We'd be hurting babies everywhere.

398
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,661
[babbling]

399
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,454
My parents are out there, too!

400
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,249
-I'm trying to think of--
-[Mega Fat giggling]

401
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,168
[giggling continues]

402
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,503
Sorry, but I figured it out.

403
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,005
They're just scared.

404
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,174
I told you that's Happy's business model.

405
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,592
How is that helpful right now?

406
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,719
It's what they're scared of.

407
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,222
Here it goes.

408
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,225
Any moment.

409
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,644
[Mega Fat] I always thought
mommies and daddies were worried

410
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,563
about having bad babies.

411
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,317
But what they're really scared of
is that they are bad parents.

412
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,319
-[giggling]
-How is this funny?

413
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,238
Get him a bottle of special formula!

414
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,282
Mega Fat got fired way before I did.

415
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,201
His six-month supply is running out.

416
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,037
-He's turning into a normal baby!
-[Mega Fat] No.

417
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,750
I have an idea, but it means
I have to turn into a normal baby.

418
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,044
-But...
-It's okay.

419
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,755
This was never your journey. It's mine.

420
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,007
And I'm not afraid anymore.

421
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,178
I'm sorry for...

422
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,472
you know, all of it.

423
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,600
My only regret is that
I never got to tell you

424
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,353
how the "Ha-Ha You're Fired" song ended.

425
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,188
Was the last line "you're fired"?

426
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,189
It was.

427
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,315
I know.

428
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,487
So, I'm just pressing play, am I?

429
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,823
No one's, uh, you know...
[clicks tongue] gonna stop me?

430
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,575
Would you just hit the darn button?

431
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,077
Well, suit yourselves.

00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,079

[gasps] Oh, I'm so sorry I lost you
and I'm a terrible mother,

438
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,181
and just tell me you're okay! [sobs]

439
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,269
Mwah.

440
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,397
Mama.

in my whole world.

-Oh!
-[parents chattering]

446
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,998
Did, uh... Did we still want
to see the tape, then, or...?

447
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,003
How did you guys even get out here?

448
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,923
Right, free-- free products for every--

449
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,966
[police siren wails]

450
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:45,470
[Doug] And after we drop off
this human garbage in jail, ice cream!

451
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,015
-[Dakota giggles]
-No, I don't think it looks infected.

452
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,683
You did great, Marsha.

453
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,602
[laughing, cooing]

454
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,813
-See you around, kid.
-[Tim] Can you hurry them up?

455
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,565
I really need to sneak back to school.

456
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,525
You're gonna wanna hurry yourself, Boss.

457
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,860
I just got a call.

458
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,404
The board of directors wants to see you.

459
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:07,242
I think they might have reconsidered
their "don't go after Bubbeezee" policy.

460
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,455
Therefore, with deepest apologies,

461
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,834
we offer you not your old position
as VP of Field Operations,

462
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:20,881
but the job you have
so righteously deserved for far too long.

463
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,426
