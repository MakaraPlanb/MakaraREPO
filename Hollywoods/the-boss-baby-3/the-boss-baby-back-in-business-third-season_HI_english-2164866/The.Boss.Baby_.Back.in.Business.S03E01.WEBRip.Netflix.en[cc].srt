175
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,303
the board decided to bring in
a real tushie-kicker to clean house.

176
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,181
[chuckles] Second,
if anybody needs to sign out

177
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,266
a pair of sensitivity earmuffs,

178
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,311
come see me, Buddy from HR.

179
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,771
Love you guys.

180
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,273
Why would we need earmuffs?

181
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,777
[elevator whirring, beeping]

182
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:55,910
[gasps]

183
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,411
[groaning]

184
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,208
[shoes squeak]

185
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:12,760
Our new boss, Scary Sweary CEO Baby.

186
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,056
Ah, good to be here.

187
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,769
Now get your [babbles] heads
out of your [babbles] and get to work!

188
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,522
-[all gasping]
-This is a business, not a [babbles]!

189
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,567
-[gasps] So much profanity!
-[babbling continues]

190
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,485
He used a no-no word.

191
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,903
What does [babbles] mean?

192
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,239
Do I look like a [babbles] dictionary?

193
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,033
[babbling continues]

194
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,034
Cool.

195
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,995
Well, we'll talk later, BB.

196
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,373
-It's from France.
-[Dad] Come on, we're here to socialize.

197
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,208
-[gasps]
-[Dad] Playgroup time!

198
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,421
Forgive me for saying this,
Marsha Krinkle, uh, big fan,

199
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,299
but I never pictured you
as the mommy type.

200
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,010
You're too kind, but also wrong.

201
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,553
It's modern times.

202
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,346
Parenting's practically a no-brainer

203
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,516
now that Wagby's taken all the worries
and guesswork out of it.

204
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,434
-Huh?
-Whu?

205
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,687
Wagby?
The animatronic childcare companion?

206
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,564
-[Dad] Really?
-[Mrs. Buskie] Let's see more.

207
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,859
-Wagby?
-It stands for "Who's A Good Baby?"

208
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,486
Is it me, Wagby? Am I a good baby?

209
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,572
Careful, no oopsies!

210
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,116
Good babies never make messes
for Mommy!

211
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,951
[chuckles] Oh, thanks, Wagby!

212
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,703
You're always so sensible!

213
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,958
Uh...

214
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,629
fine, tell me more about the kangaroo.

215
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,007
-[classical music playing]
-Wagby is always expanding baby's mind

216
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,010
with things like classical music,
foreign languages...

217
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,136
That's the smart music!

218
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,014
It's guaranteed to make me a president
or a Nobel Prize Winner,

219
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,557
or both, most likely.

220
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,725
[soft music playing]

221
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,145
Wagby even maintains
baby's ideal nap schedule

222
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,649
for physio-social development
and aspirational dreaming.

223
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,443
It's nap-naptime.

224
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,695
Es la hora de dormir.

225
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,197
Neru jikan desu.

226
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,240
Il est temps de dormir.

227
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,118
[groans, gasps]

228
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,830
Wagby says it's nappy-time.

229
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,915
Bonne nuit!

230
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,049
-[Dad] Playgroup at my place tomorrow?
-[yelps]

231
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,342
-Yeah, count me in.
-Yeah!

232
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,468
See you there!

233
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,929
Bring that kangaroo, will you?
I'd love to see more.

234
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,809
Here's news you can use: I wouldn't take
my baby anywhere without it.

235
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,188
You look stressed.

236
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,731
Want to borrow my Wagby?

237
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,610
I don't need some outback backseat driver
telling me how to be a baby.

238
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,946
[laughs] My life is great.

239
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,031
Adequate. Passable.

240
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,699
By some measures.

241
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,035
[door opens, closes]

242
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,287
[sighs] Stupid first day... [mutters]

243
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,123
What's the matter with you?

244
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,583
Where to even start?

245
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,085
You think you got it bad?

246
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,711
They assigned us an essay!

247
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,089
Who gives homework on the first day?

248
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,883
You lied to my face, lucky pencil!
[grunts]

249
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,177
Great!

250
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,889
And now I need a new stupid pencil
so I can write a stupid essay

251
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,850
that shouldn't even stupid exist!

252
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,769
[sighs] You're so lucky you're a baby.

253
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,729
[door opens, closes]

254
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,481
[groans]

255
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,652
So this is what it's come to:
unemployed, abandoned.

256
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,362
And in casualwear?

257
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,656
Who even am I anymore? [thuds]

258
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,534
[Mega Fat] A sad, failed baby
who needs marsupial companionship?

259
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,452
No!

260
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,786
Here, try mine for a day.

261
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,165
If you like it, I'll help convince
your mama and papa to buy your own.

262
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,834
Let's be the best baby a baby can be!

263
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,669
What are you, working on commission?

264
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,047
You're sad you're not a boss anymore.
Baby, I done been there.

265
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,799
But I found my new place in the world.

266
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,343
Let's help you find yours.

267
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,845
You're deranged!

268
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,973
You're the one having conversations
with an imaginary version of me

269
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,434
through a television
that's not really even turned on.

270
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,524
Find my own new place in the world!

271
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,277
[Boss Baby] You were right, hot dog man.

272
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,280
It's not adversity, it's opportunity!

273
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:07,953
Today is the first day
in the career rebranding of Boss Baby!

274
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,083
-[laughing]
-[horn toots]

275
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,671
Greetings, fellow rebel bad boy baby.

276
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,466
You'll notice I've acquired a tattoo.

277
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,885
It's the Chinese symbol for a ladybug.

278
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,012
[babbles]

279
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,557
-I am not having a mid-infancy crisis!
-[screams, thuds]

280
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,392
-[grunting]
-This is who I am now!

281
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,603
-Ah!
-Well, I will prove it!

282
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,772
-[Boss Baby growls, shouts]
-[laughing]

283
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,190
Oh! Ow.

284
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,609
-Oof!
-[Buskie laughing]

285
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:39,985
[Wagby] Not too fast.

286
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,571
Wagby says safety first.

287
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,324
That is outstanding advice, Wagby!

288
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,618
You make me so happy and good.

289
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,454
All right. New identity, take two.

290
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,456
-[blows raspberry]
-[Mr. Buskie] Got that baby!

291
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,582
[blows raspberry]

292
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,418
[Dad] Come on, baby!
B-B-B-Baby, I'm gonna get you!

293
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,795
Last babies crawling.

294
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,089
I guess we're a lot alike,
you and me. [laughs]

295
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,800
That's who we are,
just a pair of primo baby athletes.

296
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,386
-[yelps]
-[Dad] I got that baby!

297
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,679
[blows raspberry]

298
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,431
-[babbling]
-Dakota! Don't let me interrupt.

299
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,601
Just taking the temperature of the room,
trying to find my tribe.

300
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,187
Lot of interested parties, several offers,

301
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,023
but, uh, I want to make sure
everyone gets a fair shot.

302
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,150
We've never really talked.
What are you into?

303
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,735
-What do you-- Ah!
-[shouts] Mine!

304
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,363
[chuckles] No, that one's yours.

305
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,990
-This one's mi-- Ah!
-Mine!

306
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,617
-Not yours, mi-- Oh!
-[shouts]

307
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,660
Wha--? Hey!

308
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,911
-[shouts]
-Ah!

309
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,290
-How did you even...?
-[Mega Fat laughs]

310
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,459
Oh, would you like some bouncy,
fun rubber ball time now, Jarreau?

311
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,377
[coos]

312
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,880
Sharing makes everyone cheery!

313
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,214
It sure does, Wagby!

314
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,968
-[Dakota babbling]
-[shouts, growling]

315
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,595
[both shouting]

316
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,554
Mine!

317
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,932
I'm trying, but none of it's me.

318
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,977
How do they expect me to jump
from a layered-management chain of command

319
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,854
to nasal-drip mobocracy?

320
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,980
Have you tried-- [yelps]

321
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,483
No personal calls on company time,
or I'll drop your [babbles]

322
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,402
into a boiling [babbles] so fast,

323
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,946
it'll [babbles] that it'll take
an army of [babbles]

324
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,741
and a case of wet wipes to clean up,
you understand?

325
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,869
-[Jimbo whimpering]
-You bet your [babbles], sir!

326
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,998
I like the attitude.
Watch the potty chair mouth.

327
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,666
[Staci] Gotta go, Boss.

328
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,295
I guess just keep at it? Bye!

329
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,838
-[monitor chirps]
-[sighs]

330
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,802
[blowing notes]

331
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,144
Ah!

332
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,271
Do you even have eyelids?

333
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,774
-[babbling]
-What are we today, little chefs?

334
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,984
[chuckles] Fun. Mind if I join?

335
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,111
-[babbling]
-Uh, yeah, thanks. I'll get my own.

336
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,196
Hey, easy! Ah!

337
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,739
Not in my hair! [shouts]

338
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,827
-[gasps]
-[both] Oh, good, you're here!

339
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,162
You gotta help me, Templeton.

340
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,539
I don't know where I belong,
what to do with myself all day.

341
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,208
You gotta help me!

342
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,752
I'm sick of being told
what to do with myself all day!

343
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,545
-We need an adventure.
-Day planner.

344
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,507
-What are Staci and Jimbo up to?
