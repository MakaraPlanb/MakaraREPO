00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,210
[gasps] No.

176
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,006
My favorite animal is a giraffe
and a unicorn!

177
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,009
So, if I were you,
I'd think real hard about--

178
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,635
Destroying Boss Baby quickly?

179
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,305
Yeah, that's the what's up
in Toledo, Mr. Guy.

180
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,098
What? No! [groans]

181
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,526
[Mega Fat] Tiptoe sneaking out, Boss Baby?

182
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,403
Guess you heard who was after you.

183
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,613
Simmons!

184
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,573
Where are you?

185
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,492
[Mega Fat] Come and get me, Boss Baby!

186
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,162
Come run over these leaves
and get me before I get you!

187
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,789
-Simmons! Simmons!
-[Mega Fat shouting]

188
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,625
Me! Me!

189
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,211
Why are you looking for Sim--
Whoa! [groans]

190
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,297
Weird spot for a hole.

191
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,632
Simmons, no!

192
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,803
I should have known Boss Baby
would be too dumb to have the good sense

193
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,097
to fall into a tiger pit
like he's supposed to.

194
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,017
Hey there, amigo.

195
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,604
Uh, we're not really supposed to do this,
but I'm worried about you.

196
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,314
So, I made a couple of calls.

197
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,526
What is this?

198
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,321
The family Baby Corp's picked out for you
once you're ready to settle down

199
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,656
and be a good baby.

200
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,449
Phillip and Joan Watters.

201
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,492
They live on a lake.

202
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,536
They have a boat with a motor.

203
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,705
Families are for losers like Boss Baby.

204
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,792
-[door bursts open]
-Marsha Krinkle here, following a tip

205
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,337
that the blankets used to keep
the tots toasty here at Itty Bitty's

206
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,424
are filled with used staples
instead of regular blanket stuffing!

207
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,009
Aha!

208
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,014
Uh... well, this is...

209
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,892
one of the softest blankets
I've ever felt.

210
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,479
Geez, wouldn't mind one of these babies
in my house, heh.

211
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,236
I meant baby blankets.

212
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,321
Keep your peepers to yourself, kid.

213
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,073
[scoffs] Let's go, Rosie.

214
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,909
-We'll bust this place sooner or later.
-[door closes]

215
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,246
-I think she likes you!
-[screams]

216
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,124
-Magnus?
-Yeah, I said I made a couple of calls.

217
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,251
-That was the other one.
-[scoffs]

218
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,128
Still working for Baby Corp?

219
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,505
I accepted a transfer!

220
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,924
I am haunted by memories!

221
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,720
You should be, like the memory
of when you were a stinky butt-traitor

222
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,724
who tattled on me to the board of--
goo-ga-kai... yow!

223
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,018
[shouting gibberish]

224
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,855
-[bones crack]
-Ow!

225
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,567
-[Mega Fat crying]
-I only ever wanted you to find joy!

226
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,484
Aah! Oof!

227
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,278
Yeah, except we're not doing that.

228
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,614
We're doing revenge on Boss Baby.

229
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,573
Buh-bye-ski!

230
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,200
[Donald whooping]

231
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,660
[laughing]

232
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,710
[slurring] I don't answer to you
or to anybody!

233
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,086
Whoopsie-doopsie.

234
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,006
That one's a closet. Noted.

235
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:32,965
Buh-bye-ski!

236
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,178
"And when little lost gorilla
looked around,

237
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,764
he was all alone."

238
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,557
-[spits]
-Ugh!

239
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:42,975
What the--?

240
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,519
-[squishing]
-Is that a note?

241
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,438
"It's time to settle this.

242
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,984
Meet me in the stacks
to face your number one enemy, MF."

243
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,402
Who's MF?

244
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,781
Ha, as if you haven't been sweating
in constant terror

245
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,491
of this payback smack party.

246
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,993
Only one guy it could be, Boss...

247
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,412
Mr. Frederic.

248
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,665
[gasps] Estes? He's here?

249
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,958
No, it's me! Me!

250
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,086
Mega Fat. MF!

251
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,003
Makes sense.

252
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,340
I can't think of any other
number one enemies with the initials MF.

253
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,549
[gasps] Oh!

254
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,512
-The note said "MF." How clear is that?
-[thumping, scraping]

255
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,263
Does he not even remember me?

256
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,308
If I was him,
I would be up all night like, "Oh, no,

257
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,812
that terrifying Mega Fat I helped fire
is probably out for revenge.

258
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,898
What should I do?
Also, unrelated, I'm a dumb-dumb!"

259
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,193
It's a high chair!
It's never going to spin circles, Donald!

260
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,654
What? No, nobody's spinning.
I don't even like that anymore.

261
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,656
[sobbing] Don't look at me!

262
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,573
Wha-- Ooh!

263
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,870
Poison, rotten food being served
to puny, helpless babies?

264
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,539
I'm Marsha Krinkle,

265
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,918
and this facility is treating toddlers
to puke stew.

266
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,256
You see? Disgust-- mm.

267
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,966
Actually, um... mm.

268
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,801
Hmm, that's not bad. [chuckles]

269
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,886
Mm, mm, and the-- and the texture!

270
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,431
I mean, you don't even have to chew this.
[chuckles] Mm.

271
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,729
[gulps] Uh, excuse me. [laughs]

272
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,023
Really just holds its flavor, you know?

273
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,569
You guys aren't like dogs, are you?

274
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,029
I can give you chocolate, right?

275
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,574
[huffs] Another bust.

276
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,619
I'm starting to think you keep coming here
for more than just a great exposé.

277
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,121
Way too busy for a baby.

278
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,167
I-If that's what you were implying.

279
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,919
Erase that tape!

280
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,630
Mm! Mm!

281
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,800
Did you know that adults
carry candy in their pouches

282
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,302
that they can just give you?

283
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,554
Yes!

284
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,896
This boat, it doesn't have
a lame-o outboard motor does it?

285
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:56,484
Become a baby who deserves
an inboard motor!

286
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,404
[Bryce screaming]

287
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,656

[exhales, giggling]

289
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,037
For the sake of giggles and hypotheticals,

290
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,873
what would it take for me
to become a good baby?

291
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,044
[birds chirping]

292
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,462
Breathe!

293
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,672
I'm pretty dang good at breathing already.

294
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,382
It's why I'm not dead right now.

295
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,344
-In!
-Fine. [inhales]

296
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,264
Envision a cloud enveloping you in calm!

297
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,016
-Out!
-[exhales]

298
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,226
Cool cloud, very fluffy.

299
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,602
Hooray, I'm a good baby!

300
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,896
Now, let's go rip
Boss Baby's happiness to pieces

301
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,273
before I settle for a boring family life!

302
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,359
Ooh!

303
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,611
What, man?

304
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,030
I did the breathing and everything!

305
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,407
This path is revenge!

306
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,494
This path is being a good baby!

307
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,997
You cannot have both
because they will never meet!

308
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,749
[zaps]

309
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,585
Mega Fat Formerly CEO
But Now Just Regular Baby,

310
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,963
Boss Baby has betrayed us to PuppyCo,

311
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:02,591
and our new CEO requests your assistance
to bring him to justice!

312
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,136
It is the right thing to do and also
would satisfy any desire you may have

313
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,264
for vengeance against your old nemesis.

314
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,181
[claps]

315
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,684
I stand corrected!

316
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,646
It is surprisingly easy
to bring two open hands together,

317
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,149
and it makes a satisfying clapping sound!

318
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,401
I accept!

319
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:21,694
[bell dings]

320
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,115
[rock music playing]

321
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,576
Oh... [speaking gibberish]

322
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,995
Snap! Rewind! It's a comeback!

323
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:31,912
Hello!

324
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,206
You must be the new CEO.

325
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,500
A-cha-cha-ta-ta-ta-ta. I know.

326
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,378
You're terrified Boss Baby
will stab you in the back

327
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,880
and send you down the firing chute.

328
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,215
I feel you, new CEO lady.

329
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,218
-Don't worry, Mega Fat is here.
-[Boss] Keep at it.

330
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,264
Whatever happens, I swear one thing:
I will not take the fall for this!

331
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,932
[Tim] And I swear one more thing:

332
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,561
I will not be getting new church slacks
from Junior Fancy's.

333
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,605
Not this day!

334
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,399
-Aah!
-Church slacks. Junior Fancy's.

335
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,694
Cooly-cool.
See you there with my Bossy posse!

336
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,696
Whoop! I've spooked him.

337
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,616
He'll be doing all he can
to avoid Junior Fancy's,

338
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,243
so let's find him
before he escapes for good.

339
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,580
Overturn every stroller!
Kick down every playhouse door!

340
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:19,293
We could also geolocate his chupie
with the chupie tracker!

341
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,419
That option!

342
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,212
[zaps]

343
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,634

344
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,052
-Booshah!
-Aah!

345
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,637
-Aah!
-[all shouting]

346
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,930
Get off me!

347
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,182
