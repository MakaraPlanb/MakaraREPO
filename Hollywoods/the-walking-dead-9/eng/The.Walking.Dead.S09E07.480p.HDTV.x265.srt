Dad, we're holding things together with
plastic and tape. We need better tools.

I mean, I'm not
hearing you deny it.

62
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,080
Doesn't mean I trust them.

about having options, huh?

64
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,390

out in the open

65
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,200
because you gave them a reason
not to trust us...

66
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,530
I choose that option.

That's one word for it.

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,130
She's been on edge
since we lost Bernie.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,400
Was he with you long?

78
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,640
Long enough.

79
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,040
He loved
getting under Magna's skin.

80
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,450
He, um, used to wear
this absolutely horrid shirt.

81
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,650
It was like looking into
creation itself.

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,990
In paisley.

83
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,550
God, it was horrendous.

84
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,120
But Magna hated it.

85
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,460
She said just looking at it
gave her a migraine.

86
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,530
So Bernie wore it
every day for a week.

87
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,330
Honestly, I think
she came around on the shirt.

88
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,800
Just like
she came around on him.

89
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,570

to expand the crop fields,

143

how far she can cultivate.

144

more room in the garden

147
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,060
to send another team out
for scrap metal.

148
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,960

from trailer 7.

149
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,230

150
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,100

a kazoo?

You... You find a kazoo,
you give it to a kid.

152

I'll deal with it.

153

491

492
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,660
seeing her after all this time...

493

494
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,160

doing out there?

495
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,470
I've been training him.

496

Talking to him.

497

Keeping the lines
of communication open.

498
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,270
Making sure they're still alive.

499
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,270
To avoid being here?

500
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,880
To try and get Alexandria
on board with the fair.

501
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,310
They won't.

502
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,480
I can't accept that.

503

00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,350

how much you're gone.

507
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,960
The fair is important
to all of us,

508
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,260
but we need you here.

509
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,490
Why?

510
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,960
Because they made you our leader.

511

you're just keeping a promise to Maggie,

515
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,370
but you took this job.

516
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,610
So stop pretending
it's just for now.

all this time?

Why?

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,130
It's art.

582
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,560
Here we go.

583
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,730
Look, for a very long time,

584
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,570
historians and archeologists
have wondered

585
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,170
how did ancient humans
survive the Neanderthals?

586
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,010
Okay?

587
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,780
How did we defeat them
when they were bigger

588
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,380
and they were smarter
and they were stronger, faster?

589
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,150
They had better tools than us.

590
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,890
So why are we still here
and they're not?

591
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,490
<font color="#ff00ff">[Inhales sharply]</font>

592
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,160
And then they found a cave.

593
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,390
Okay?

594
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,560
And in that cave,

595
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,170
they found
a 40,000-year-old flute.

596
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,900
A flute?
Yes.

597
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,470
A flute.
<font color="#ff00ff">[Chuckling]</font> Yeah.

598
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,970
And then they realized

599
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,610
that maybe ancient humans
didn't defeat Neanderthal.

600
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,710
Not in the way that we think
of the word "defeat," okay?

601
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,120
They came together
as an answer to defeat.

602
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,790
They sat around a campfire.

603
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,190
They shared their stories
with each other

604
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,620
in the form of music.

605
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,060
And paintings.

606
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,630
And... And they created
a... a common identity.

607
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,090
And then they, you know,

608
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,800
they... they built communities,
and they grew.

609
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,230
And... And then, as they grew,
Neanderthal retreated,

610
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,670
and then, after a while,
they just died out.

611
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,170
So this, yeah.

612
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,410
This. This.

613
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,810
This is the one thing

614
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,410
that separates us
from the animals.

615
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,410
For better or for worse,
it brings us together.

616
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,020
And if we're trying
to rebuild something,

617
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,520
you can't ignore that.

618
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,430
After everything
you've seen and done,

619
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,530
you still believe
that's all it'll take?

620
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,660
Yeah.

621
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:56,270
It's survival of the fittest.

622
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,840
Sharing with each other...

623
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,210
that's part
of what makes us stronger.
