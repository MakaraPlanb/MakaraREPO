"The Walking Dead"...

2
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:16,839
It's time to see Negan.

3
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:19,425
You know what keeping
Negan alive means to us.

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,826
I know what seein' him dead
means to her.

5
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:25,848
Please...You don't have to do this.
I forgive you, Anne.

6
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:29,824
Take 'em to the bridge.

7
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:31,455
It ain't ever gonna hold, and
they'll get washed out to sea.

8
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:33,824
No, man, I'm not sacrificing the bridge.
I'll find another way.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,430
Damn it!

10
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,852
Wake up.

11
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:57,466
Wake up.

12
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,555
It's time to go.

13
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:06,997
Wake up.

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,494
What is your wound?

15
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,116
Wake up.

16
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,773
Yeah, wake up, asshole.

17
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:09,277
Aah, aah!

19
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,969
Jadis, confirm location.

20
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,800
Confirm location
and status of your "A."

21
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,678
I'm in a clearing.

22
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:54,332
East bank of the Accotink.

23
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:57,727
1.6 miles due north
of the junkyard.

24
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:59,642
You have the "A"?

25
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:01,383
I have the "A,"

26
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,559
and it's ready for transport.

27
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,170
We hadn't heard from you
since the aborted pickup.

28
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,956
We know your group
vacated the landfill.

29
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,740
If this is a trick,

30
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:13,526
there can still be consequences.

31
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,005
It's not a trick.

32
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,746
If I need evacuation,

33
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,183
you know that I'm desperate.

34
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:21,621
I need to leave this place.

35
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:24,580
You know where to find me.

36
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,900
And I'll be ready.

37
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,791
I need to keep 'em safe.

38
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:05,229
I need to stay awake.

39
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:09,494
Lead 'em away. Some...

40
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,824
Easy.

41
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,580
Whoa.

42
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:55,192
Gimme a minute.

43
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:38,192
We can go now.

44
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:06,742
Hey! Hey!

45
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,022
Easy. Whoa. Whoa.

46
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,029
Whoa, whoa.

47
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:52,738
I'm looking for my family.

48
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:55,349
What's your wound?

49
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:01,355
God damn, cowboy.

50
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,530
Look like shit.

51
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:07,796
So, what is this?

52
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,190
What is this?
Come on, Rick. Look around.

53
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,975
You know what this is.

54
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,326
Are those the idiots
we were chasin'?

55
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:16,718
Attaboy.

56
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:18,764
Dispatch said there was
two suspects, right?

57
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:20,156
Oh, there's a third man.

58
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,549
Yes, there was.

59
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:26,380
That third man
changed everything, didn't he?

60
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:30,253
I'm looking for my family.

61
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,603
Oh, is that what you're doing,

62
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:32,995
looking for yourfamily, huh?

63
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,257
Mm-hmm.

64
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,998
Well, see,
that's not entirely true.

65
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:37,435
One could argue

66
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:39,654
it's myfamily
you're lookin' for, right?

67
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,831
How is my baby girl, by the way?

68
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,398
Got my eyes, doesn't she?

69
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:46,008
Mm.

70
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,358
She hasn't got your nose.

71
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,404
Good thing she ain't got my ears, man.

72
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,799
Ah, you're...
You're such an asshole.

73
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:55,627
Oh, yes, I am, yes, I am.

74
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,498
I am theasshole. Hm.

75
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:59,108
Same as you, really.

76
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:01,023
Oh, you think I'm an asshole?

77
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,243
I don't thinka thing, man.
I knowyou're an asshole.

78
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:04,853
I like to take credit
for that, actually, Rick,

79
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,246
when I think about it.

80
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:07,552
I mean, I'm sure
others did influence you,

81
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:11,077
but I'd like to take full credit.

82
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,905
I didn't want it.

83
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:14,472
You know that.

84
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:17,910
But you took it, right?

85
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:20,826
Boy, that shit you did in that field,

86
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:22,828
just you and me,

87
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:26,266
man, you took a page
out of my book, Rick.

88
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,877
You know, I'm glad you did it.

89
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,402
You stepped up, brother.

90
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:32,968
It had to be me.

91
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,796
Still has to be me.

92
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,276
Yeah, see, Rick, yeah,

93
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,453
I think
that's where you're wrong.

94
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:40,976
Has to be me.

95
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,978
You? 
That's right.

96
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:46,199
The only way
this gets done, Rick.

97
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:48,723
I want you to think about

98
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:52,727
how you bit that piece of shit's
throat out.

99
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:55,991
Asshole in the church
with the red machete.

100
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:57,340
That is what I'm talkin' 'bout.

101
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,820
That's the shit that I need from you

102
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:00,474
that I always knew
you had in you.

103
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:03,129
I knew you had it in you, Rick,
and it is time.

104
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:04,435
You want answers?

105
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:06,437
You wanna know
what this is all about,

106
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,395
this right here, you and me?
I asked you, didn't I?

107
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:09,918
Yeah, you did ask,
so now I'm gonna tell ya,

108
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,224
and I want you to listen carefully.

109
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,486
You got it? 
Mm.

110
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,922
It's time.

111
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,489
Kneel down.

112
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,795
Dig deep.

113
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:19,319
Find it, Rick...
The rage, the hatred.

114
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,887
Find it. The loyalty
that's in there, find it.

115
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,236
It's in there, Rick.

116
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,412
It's the only way
that this gets done,

117
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:26,979
and this has to get done.

118
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,241
You understand me?

119
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:30,678
It has to.

120
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:33,681
You can do it, brother.

121
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:38,120
I'm sorry.

122
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:41,384
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

123
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,519
You need to forget that shit.

124
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:55,442
You know somethin', Rick?

125
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:56,661
Wake up!

126
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:53,674
What are you makin'?

127
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:55,110
A bracelet.

128
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:58,244
Oh, with the shells? 
Mm-hmm.

129
00:13:58,287 --> 00:13:59,724
That's gonna be pretty.

130
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,509
A creature used to live in this one?

131
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:04,163
Yeah, all of them.

132
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:07,296
This one? 
Yep.

133
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:21,267
Hey.
Hope I'm not...

134
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,660
No, no.
Come on in.

135
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,403
What's goin' on?

136
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:28,753
Maggie's here.

137
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,885
Aunt Maggie.

138
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:32,800
One of the guys at the gate
told me she just came in.

139
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,062
What?

140
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:52,646
Maggie?

141
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,213
Get out of my way.

142
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:57,259
You're willing to turn this
into something else?

143
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:58,652
For him?

144
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:01,916
Not for him, for me.

145
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:05,398
For others.

146
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:07,530
For Glenn.

147
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,097
Negan should've died
under that tree.

148
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,708
But he didn't die, Maggie.

149
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:11,970
It's done.

150
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:13,667
Because Rick decided it was?

151
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,934
Step... back.

152
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:24,722
You were there, Michonne.

153
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,855
You saw what Negan did.

154
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,684
You think Glenn would want this?

155
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:33,208
For you to go through me
to get to him?

156
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:36,516
I dunno what he'd want.

157
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,301
I dunno, because I never
got to say goodbye.

158
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:41,303
He wouldn't want it, Maggie.

159
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:43,697
Your father wouldn't want this.

160
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:45,046
You know this.

161
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,875
The only thing I had,
the one thing I had

162
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,183
was knowing I was gonna see
Glenn's murderer die,

163
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:52,793
and you took it from me.

164
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:54,055
So takin' it back,

165
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:56,144
what the hell is that gonna do?

166
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,407
It's gonna start things over.
No.

167
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:00,496
It's gonna start something else.

168
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,674
If he'd butchered Rick in
front of you instead of Glenn...

169
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,153
Mm, Maggie.

170
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,112
If you had a child
to raise alone because of him,

171
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:09,331
he would've been dead
a long time ago,

172
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,116
and you know it.

173
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,641
So stop actin' like
this is a choice.

174
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:18,906
Stop actin' like
I can just turn it off.

175
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,561
Because it has been
a year and a half,

176
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:23,128
and I can't.

177
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:30,178
You're gonna have to find a way.

178
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,051
Tell me how.

179
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:39,927
If there is something else
that I can do, Michonne.

180
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,669
Because I can't keep
livin' like this.

181
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:51,112
I...

182
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:52,766
I can't.

183
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,942
I can't.

184
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,686
'Cause there's nothin'
you can say.

185
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:07,738
There's only what you do.

186
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:11,916
And you can live
with what comes after?

187
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,963
Have to.

188
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:18,705
Can't live with it now.

189
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:55,437
Aw, she just gave up
the keys, huh?

190
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:57,439
It's a shame.

191
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,181
She got the blade, but you...

192
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:02,662
You got the fire.

193
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:05,491
My money was on you.

194
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,841
So you remember me.

195
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,930
'Course I do.

196
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:12,890
It's why I thought
you were gonna win.

197
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,544
Good.

198
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,504
Get on your knees.

199
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,434
You know, I remember you
screamin' in that clearing.

200
00:18:35,477 --> 00:18:37,479
I remember how much I broke you

201
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:39,568
breakin' open
your husband's head like I did.

202
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:41,266
Glenn.

203
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:43,485
His name was Glenn.

204
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:44,747
So now what?

205
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,272
You finally come for...

206
00:18:47,315 --> 00:18:48,664
revenge?

207
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,971
Justice.Damn.

208
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:55,019
Thought you'd do this
a hell of a lot sooner.

209
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:58,022
It take you this long
to work up your nerve?

210
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,285
I was always gonna settle this,

211
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:04,115
what you did to my husband.

212
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:05,116
Get on your knees.

213
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:06,987
What I did to him?

214
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:09,294
You mean
how I cracked open his skull

215
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:11,774
and popped out
his goddamn eyeball?

216
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,300
How I bashed his big,
beautiful brains into the ground

217
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:18,303
over and over while you
and his little friends watched?

218
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:20,044
Is that what you mean?

219
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:27,225
Ah, I used to say
that I didn't enjoy killin'.

220
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:29,314
That was a lie.

221
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:32,317
Your old man...

222
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,320
Christ, I forgot his name again.

223
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:37,496
But he was different.

224
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,933
Killin' him the way I did,

225
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:43,632
ooh, now, that was fun.

226
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,946
Get to it.

227
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,949
Have your justice.

228
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:58,952
Kill me.

229
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:02,434
It was worth it.

230
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:05,916
Lemme see you in the light.

231
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,312
Come on.

232
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:13,880
Kill me.

233
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:16,361
You not have it in you?

234
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:18,798
Don't you punk out like Rick.

235
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,365
Come into the light.

236
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:21,757
Kill me.

237
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:24,064
This is what you came here for!

238
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,805
You kill me!

239
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:29,330
Move into the light.

240
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:32,420
Kill me.

241
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:46,608
Please. Please.

242
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:48,741
Please kill me.

243
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:51,439
Why? You have to.

244
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,746
Just do it. You tell me why!

245
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,401
Tell me!
Why should I?!

246
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:58,620
So I can be with my wife!

247
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:01,188
So I can be with Lucille!

248
00:21:06,454 --> 00:21:09,066
I should be dead.

249
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:11,851
I have to be dead.

250
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:14,810
And it's supposed to be you.

251
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:18,727
It has to be you,
because I can't do it.

252
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:20,207
I can't do it.

253
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:21,643
I've tried.

254
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,428
I can't.

255
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:26,126
I can't be like this.

256
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,044
Please, please don't make me
stay like this.

257
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:33,829
It's... Settle it.

258
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:35,962
Settle me.

259
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:37,790
Kill me.

260
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,487
Please.

261
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,230
Get back in your cell.

262
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:44,753
No.

263
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,277
No.

264
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,800
No.

265
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:49,671
No. Why?

266
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:54,676
I came to kill Negan,

267
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,983
and you're already
worse than dead.

268
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:03,250
That settles it.

269
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:05,078
Go.

270
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:14,218
It wasn't supposed to
be like this.

271
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:17,830
It wasn't supposed to
be like this.

272
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,055
Maggie, Michonne,
somethin's up at the camp.

273
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:31,163
I need to lead 'em.

274
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:36,690
Gotta find my family.

275
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:57,189
What's your wound?

276
00:24:02,803 --> 00:24:05,850
Hey, Rick.

277
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:07,678
Here.

278
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:11,203
Look at this.

279
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:18,384
This place.

280
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:21,518
It's beautiful.

281
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,825
It is something, isn't it?

282
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:36,228
I'm so sorry
for what happened to you.

283
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:39,275
To Beth and Glenn.

284
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:42,843
For everything Maggie's lost.

285
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:44,367
Rick.

286
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,413
Maybe if I tried harder,

287
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:50,416
done things different,
listened more...

288
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,420
My girl, she's strong,

289
00:24:54,464 --> 00:25:00,078
and my grandson,
he'll only make her stronger.

290
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:03,386
You ain't gotta worry about her.

291
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:08,042
I need to find my family.

292
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,873
I need to keep 'em together.

293
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:15,876
No, you don't.

294
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,444
You only think you do.

295
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:21,882
I know it's been hard.

296
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:25,103
It has.

297
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:30,108
What you wanted for me,
for Carl,

298
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:32,676
it hasn't been easy.

299
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,290
We've been tryin'...
But we'll get there.

300
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:40,379
All of us.

301
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,471
I'm tired, Hershel.

302
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:50,694
My family...

303
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:57,744
Maybe I can find 'em here.

304
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:01,618
No, Rick.

305
00:26:02,836 --> 00:26:04,273
You have to wake up.

306
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,754
What's your wound?

307
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:38,209
They...

308
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:40,167
They're all dead.

309
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:42,213
Yeah.

310
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:44,607
I know.

311
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,956
And it's okay.

312
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,653
How can it be okay?

313
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:52,136
How... How can this be okay?

314
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:55,879
'Cause you did your part,

315
00:28:55,922 --> 00:29:00,536
like I did mine,

316
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:02,015
like the others did before us.

317
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,192
How?

318
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:08,892
They give us the strength
that we needed

319
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:11,982
to do what we had to do
for the others,

320
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,117
and the others
draw strength from us.

321
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:19,903
We change each other.

322
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:23,341
We help each other.

323
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:24,690
We make each other better.

324
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:30,566
And it never ends.

325
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:36,528
It feels like it's ending.

326
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:39,705
Little things do end,

327
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:42,534
but it's never
the end of everything,

328
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:44,536
because we don't die.

329
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,367
It's not about you or me
or any one of us.

330
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,240
It's about all of us.

331
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:57,767
And I don't think
it just evens out.

332
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:03,512
I think it always crosses over
toward the good,

333
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:05,688
toward the brave,

334
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:10,562
toward love.

335
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:17,090
Your family...

336
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:21,399
You're not gonna find them,
because they're not lost.

337
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:27,971
And you are not lost.

338
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,543
What you need to do is wake up.

339
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,568
No.

340
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:16,236
No.

341
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:29,151
Rick.

342
00:33:29,194 --> 00:33:31,414
Rick!

343
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:47,473
It's okay.

344
00:33:49,214 --> 00:33:52,783
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

345
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:54,742
No, you take care of them.

346
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:56,265
I can't.
You will.

347
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:57,527
I can't.

348
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,616
You will.

349
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:01,792
It's not over.

350
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:04,316
We don't die.

351
00:34:11,454 --> 00:34:15,806
You wanna know
why I fell in love with you?

352
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,809
Because you're a fighter,

353
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:22,204
and you never give up.

354
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:24,554
So fight, Rick.

355
00:34:24,597 --> 00:34:27,644
Fight for me.

356
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:30,168
Fight for all of us.

357
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:38,829
You're my family.

358
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:43,573
I found you.

359
00:34:43,616 --> 00:34:46,837
You did.

360
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:53,061
But this...

361
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:59,458
This isn't real.

362
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:02,244
Yes, it is.

363
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:07,423
Now wake up.

364
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:54,356
No. No.

365
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:01,145
It's gonna hold.

366
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:05,933
I can't.

367
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,022
I can't.

368
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:33,047
What is he doing?!

369
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,613
He's hurt!

370
00:37:34,657 --> 00:37:36,528
That herd that
went right through Hilltop.

371
00:37:36,572 --> 00:37:38,008
He's trying
to bring down the bridge.

372
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:40,141
No.

373
00:37:40,184 --> 00:37:42,926
We turn them around.
Fight 'em back.

374
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,841
Fire your guns.

375
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:47,017
Try to divert them.

376
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:54,807
No, don't do it,
not for me.

377
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:56,200
It's too many.

378
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:57,680
No.

379
00:37:57,723 --> 00:38:01,249
It's not working!
Keep trying.

380
00:39:12,624 --> 00:39:16,411
Rick!

381
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,500
I found 'em.

382
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,397
What was that?

383
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:53,921
Was that the bridge?

384
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:57,098
Rick! He blew it
to stop the herd!

385
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,886
Move north,
break up the rest.

386
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,062
Bring some guns.

387
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:51,543
I have a "B."

388
00:41:51,587 --> 00:41:52,936
Not an "A."

389
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,372
I never had an "A."

390
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:56,157
He's hurt, but he's strong.

391
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,376
Can you help him?

392
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,378
I warned you
there'd be consequences

393
00:42:00,422 --> 00:42:02,772
if you tried something.

394
00:42:02,816 --> 00:42:06,689
It's not a trick, not anymore.

395
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,563
I'm trying to save a friend...

396
00:42:11,607 --> 00:42:14,871
A friend who saved me.

397
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:17,395
I have something for you now.

398
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:19,833
We have a deal?

399
00:42:24,228 --> 00:42:26,404
Do we have a deal?

400
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:48,644
You're still here.

401
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:52,691
You're gonna be okay.

402
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:54,215
I'm gonna save you.

403
00:43:54,753 --> 00:43:56,973
Run!

404
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:24,827
This is it. Stand me up.
We need to fight.

405
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,524
Walking's not gonna do it.

406
00:44:26,568 --> 00:44:29,353
Okay, shit.
Okay.

407
00:44:29,397 --> 00:44:31,399
Mag, what do we do?
We circle up.

408
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:33,227
Knives up. We fight.

409
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,230
No, let's just
open up a seam, okay?

410
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,753
Okay.

411
00:44:45,543 --> 00:44:47,067
C'mon this way!
It's clear!

412
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,329
Go!
Go, go, go!

413
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,345
You got names?

414
00:45:04,388 --> 00:45:05,563
I'm Magna.

415
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:09,350
This is Connie and Kelly
and Yumiko and Luke.

416
00:45:09,393 --> 00:45:11,265
What's yours?

417
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:22,363
Judith.

418
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:24,800
Judith Grimes.
