All of us.

There's a way we could
sneak out at Hilltop.

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,660
I saw some kids do it the other night.

350
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,960
Well, I vote we go.

351
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,700
Who else?

352
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,300
It's Luke.

353
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,370
Minute by minute,

354

You know, some dads would
come up with any excuse...

364
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
just to beat the shit out of their kids.

365

Your dad sounds a lot

Except the part

374
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,840
where he sang to you
when you were scared.

375

376
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,040

when I walked down here.

381
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,660
And those bruises on your arm,

382
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,300
they come from a beating.

383
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,070
So let me ask you, if your dad's dead,

384
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,880
who gave 'em to you?

385
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,870
My mom.

386
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,670
Where is she?

387
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,670
Be glad you don't know.

388
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,440
Where is she?

389
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,080
Where's your camp?

390
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,880
Why are you protectin' her?

392
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,720
You're safer here.

393
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,090
This place isn't real.

394

The world changed,

395
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,960
and you're all acting like
it's gonna change back.

396
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,700
My mom walks 'cause
that's what the dead do.

397
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,430
It's their world, and
we have to live in it.

398
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,510
And what my mom does,
she does for a reason.

399
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,340
Your mom beats you
because she loves you?

400
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,510
That's bullshit.

401
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,920
No, it isn't.

482

483

her first husband would grab it

He would pull it and
slam her against the wall.

So, one day...

487

she just cut it all off so he couldn't.

Had that cold look in her eye.

So this whole time

722
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,850
Lydia's mom made her think
it was her fault her dad died?

723
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,070
Why would a mom do that to a kid?

724
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,380
Some people ain't meant to be parents.

725
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,850
So what happens now?

726
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,520
Can she stay here with us?

727
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,390
We'll see.

728
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,850
Should get her some fresh clothes.

729
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,260
I'ma talk to Tara, see about that camp.

What'd you find?

736
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,420
Nothing.

737
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,890
Look, it was wrong of us to leave.

738

I just wish...

739
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,690

just do me a favor and come
and talk to me about it.

I don't know if I'm doing
the right thing here.
