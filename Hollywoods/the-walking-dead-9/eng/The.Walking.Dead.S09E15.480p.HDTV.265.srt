always seen eye-to-eye

168
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,760
with everyone in this room.

169
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,760
But I never stopped
caring about any of you.

170
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,660
I was just trying to protect my family

171
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,760
and do right by my people.

172
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,770
Alexandria's future is here.

173
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,570
Together, with you.

174
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,780
And we lost sight of that for a while.

175
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,980
But...

176
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,410
I'm here now.

177
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,580
We're here now.

178
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,730
I've taken an informal vote

179
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,420
with the other council
members at the fair,

180
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,990
and we all agree.

181
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,960
Alexandria is willing
to grant asylum to Lydia.

182
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,760
She's one of us now.

183
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,600
We hope the rest of you can
join us in doing the same.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Thank you.

185
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,810
I'll do whatever I can to earn my keep

186
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,210
- and pay you back.
- If her mother retaliates,

187
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,850
it's gonna be against
Hilltop, not Alexandria.

188
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,810
I have to do right by my people.

189
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,650
I thought we were on the same page.

190
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,980
<font color="#138ce9">MICHONNE:</font> We were.

191
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,050
And, look, when she came to my gates,

192
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,720
I asked her to run away.

193
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,290
And when she didn't, I was angry.

194
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,070
Then you know why I'm
not okay with this.

195
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,390
I do.

196
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,610
I also know why Rick didn't trust me

197
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,000
when I showed up at
the gates of the prison.

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,200
And how people didn't trust you

199
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,570
after seeing you

200
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,680
on the other side of
the Governor's firing line.

201
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,380
<font color="#138ce9">RACHEL:</font> I was gonna kill you on sight

202
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,480

203
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,050
Okay, okay. Fair.

204
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,160
Lydia didn't choose where she came from,

205
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,060
but she chose where she wanted to be.

206
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,730
Just like everybody in this room.

207
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,070
I left some of my best
fighters at Hilltop,

208
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,190
but if Daryl's right about
these skin job numbers,

209
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,510
<font color="#ff00ff">[SCOFFS]</font> it's not enough people.

210
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,880
We should take a group
to Hilltop to protect 'em,

211
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,960
just in case.

212
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,190
It's a good idea.

213
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,910
I'll take some from the Kingdom.

214
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,880
Oceanside can spare some fighters.

215
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,480
Alexandria can, too.

216
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,030
<font color="#138ce9">RACHEL:</font> So we head out in the morning?

217
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,860
No, they can take advantage
if we wait. We should go today.

218
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,560
Agreed. But sending more people
is only a short-term solution.

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,360
In order to face this threat,

220
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,530
the four communities have
to present a united front.

221
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,870
Which is why I'm proposing
a mutual protection pact.

222
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,770
An attack against one community

223
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,640
is an attack against all of us.

224
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,620
Together, we can make
these people think twice

225
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,910
before moving against the Hilltop.

226
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,310
The leadership of the Kingdom

227
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,550
is very amenable to this idea.

228
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,920
Oceanside's down.

229
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,560
