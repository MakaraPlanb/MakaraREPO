Seems Mother Nature served us up

80

a serious bowl of whoop-ass

81
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:18,253

82

84

of the rapid current
against the supports,

86

plus the added weight

87
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,082
from the construction
materials and whatnot,

88
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,785
I take no pleasure in saying that,

89

97

The two nearby herds

98
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,417
one Tybalt and Cordelia,

99
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,223
are running parallel, as expected,

100
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:55,129
but, luckily, show no signs of merging,

101
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:56,941
which is first-rate news,

102
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,624
not only for the camp's safety

103
00:08:58,627 --> 00:08:59,926
but because, once merged,

104
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,962
neither Tordelia nor Cordalt

105
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:05,965
had a particularly good ring to them.

106
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:09,235
The herd monikers
are from the great book...

107
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,887
of plays.

108
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,183
