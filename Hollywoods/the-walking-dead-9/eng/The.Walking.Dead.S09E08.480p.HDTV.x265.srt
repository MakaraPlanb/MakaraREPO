No. Just me.

234
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,570
I'm dropping off Henry.

235
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,840
He's gonna be apprenticing

- Mm-hmm.

He's a good kid. He's got a big heart.

238
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,580
And he sees his home falling apart,

239
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,750
and he wants to help out.

240
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,980
I read Ezekiel's letter.

You know that.

250
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,130
I know what you went through.

251
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,000
And I get why this is hard for you.

252
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,510
But we've all lost something.

253
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,010
You and me, we both lost children.

254
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,010
And we kept going.

255
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,110
For each other. We've
always been a family.

256
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,820
And we still are.

257
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,280
But Kingdom is Kingdom,

258
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,360
Hilltop is here, and
Alexandria is there,

259
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,150
and in between, there's a
whole lot of broken world,

260
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,750
and we cannot pretend otherwise.

261
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,900
We've got to take care of our own now.

262
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,540

It's good. Good.

351
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,930
Yeah, um, Alden is showing
me how to make a spearhead.

352
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,950
He's picking it up fast.

353
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,230
Well, of course he is.

354
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,420
Maybe we should keep him

355
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,630

the other day.

You know what a smell is?

371
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,470
It's when odor molecules

372
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,570
activate neurons in your nasal passages.

373
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,070
So every time you come in here

374

375
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,880
something that was actually in my ass

376
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,250
goes right up your nose.

377

379
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,320
I never know exactly which
eye I'm supposed to look at.

380
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,690
It's a little bit distracting.

381
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,330

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,600
For once in your life,
shut your damn mouth.

383
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,360
I keep scratching at you.

384
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,700
I keep trying to figure out
what's underneath it all,

385
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,500
'cause I think, if I dig deep enough,

386
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,120
I'll find a person.

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,610

Rosita's at Hilltop.

391
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,510
I sent her out, and she got hurt.

392
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,750
The messenger doesn't know

393

what happened or how bad it is.

394
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,130
And I can't go to help her

395
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,130
because I have to be here with you.

396
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,730

from perambulating ad

They're not dead in any
sense that makes sense.

629
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,350
It takes an impact to the
cranium to stop them,

630
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,720
which means the brain is alive,

- Good.

"Beat from the trip," I think you said.

I assume from the reek

691

coming off of you that that was a lie.

Yes, sir. It was.

693

found you outside the gate,

No, sir. I do not.

Well, who gave you the booze?

698
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,160
Okay, then.

699
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,560
I offered to take you on and teach you,

703
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,740
