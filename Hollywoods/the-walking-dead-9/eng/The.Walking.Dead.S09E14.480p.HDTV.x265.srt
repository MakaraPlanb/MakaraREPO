Nothing, really.

387
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,860
- Um, just chit-chat.
- Specifics.

388
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,130
Homework, sometimes.

389
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,530
Other times, how much
she misses her Uncle Daryl.

390
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,150
She likes hearing stories about her dad.

391
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,200
- And Carl.
- So you feed her bullshit.

392
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,270
She'd smoke out the
bullshit, you know that.

393
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,040
I let her know

394
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,310
that she's just as much
a badass as Carl was.

395
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,280
How he got into the Sanctuary

396
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,050
and shot up a bunch of my men.

397
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,650

- but they are new to her.
- Mm.

400
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
And you tell her these things why?

401
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,290
Because you know that I haven't?

402
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,430
Or because you're trying to
earn some sort of trust with her?

403
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,210
Something that you can use?

404
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,090
- She likes listening to me talk.
- You like hearing yourself talk.

405
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,870

Yes, it is.

You're my mom.

You chose to be.

Your father and I dug this together.

724

And that day, standing right here,

725

I made a promise to never
bury another child again.
