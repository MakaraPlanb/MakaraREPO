688
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,220
I never said it did.

689
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,860
So, what do we do?

690
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,150
- We live with it.
- Yeah.

691
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,470
That's what Enid said.

692
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,870
I saw the scars on your back.

693
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,010
I think you know better than anyone

694
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,410
what we just sent her back to.

695
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,560
How can you live with that?

696
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,060
Look...

697
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,900
the world is just shit sometimes.

698
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,060
And you live with it.

699
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,670
Sometimes that's all you can do.

700
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,670
Yeah, but what about before?

701
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,500
At Alexandria?

702
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,380
I know what you did to help
when things went bad there.

703
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,790
No.

704
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,360
You don't.

705
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,480
Not really.

706
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,720
I did what I had to do today.

707
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,120
We all did.
