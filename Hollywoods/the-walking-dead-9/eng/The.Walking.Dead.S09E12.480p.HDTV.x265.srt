00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,730
I read Ezekiel's letter.

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,970
We really need this fair.

7
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,940
If Alexandria could
just send a delegation...

8
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,050
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,020
Your body's been through a lot lately.

10
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,080
- You...
- It's not that.

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,580
I'm pregnant.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,460

He was ready to fight to keep you.

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,380

No.

Did you tell him about us?

26
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,740
That there are only a few of us.

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,940
That I hated living like this.

28
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,850
I lied to get them to trust me.

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,020
Except for one thing.

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,290
I said they shouldn't cross you.

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,240
<font color="#ffff00">♪</font>

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,760
What did you find out?

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,400
They have mostly farmland.

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,370
Some supplies.

35
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,740
Their weapons are basic.

36
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,110
A few guns but not enough.

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,210
Any signs of trade?

38
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,280
No.

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,450
I don't think, no.

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,420
What else?

41
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,550
That's it.

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,720
That's it?!

43
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,490
I broke my own rules comin' to get you.

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,930
What do I get in return?

45
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,160
Excuses.

46
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,330

00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,140
<font color="#138ce9">GABRIEL:</font> Just Eugene and Rosita.

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,240
We would've told you if
we'd found someone out there,

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,640
but we didn't.

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,480
Then who knows who else was listening?

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,180
We weren't being careless with it.

64
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,580
Rosita and Eugene went
out to set up this relay

65
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,600
and almost died because of it.

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,420
Jesus did die because of it.

67
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,660
Negan got out while you were distracted

68
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,990
because of it!

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
I can't do my job

70
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,000
if the council is
keeping things from me.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,900
We gave you the power
to veto the council

72
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,770
based on security concerns,

73
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,540
but now everything
is a security concern.

74
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,060
So our votes don't matter anymore,

75
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,570
unless you agree with them.

76
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,510
Putting ourselves out
there when we don't have to

77
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,820
is dangerous!

78
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,920
So is cutting us off from
the rest of the world.

79
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,190
Who are we supposed to
turn to when we need help?

80
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,520
We can't be so worried
about finding enemies

81
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,860
that we lose our friends.

82
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,590
<font color="#138ce9">AARON:</font> And we did lose a friend.

83
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,420
Look, we all set out with
the best of intentions,

84
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,510
but that doesn't change what happened.

85
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,850
There's a new enemy out there,

86
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,320
and they're exactly

87
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,440
what Michonne was afraid we'd find.

88
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,450
I don't regret the time

89
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,450
that I spent out there
with Jesus... I don't.

90
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,620
And what happened...

91
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,750
Maybe that would've happened anyway.

92
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,120
Maybe.

93
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,830
But now we know what's out there,

94
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,330
and we can't pretend otherwise.

95
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,300
We put Michonne in charge of security

96
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,940
for a reason.

97
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,510
Her judgment has saved
us time and again.

98
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,110
Yes, but at what cost?

99
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,920
We saw Carol when we
were at the Hilltop.

100
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,120
And she told me

101
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,020
that she tried asking Michonne

102
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,480
for help with the fair again,

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,360
and she said that you turned her down.

104
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,110
You spoke on behalf of Alexandria?

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,930
The question of the trade
fair is old business.

106
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,930
Yes, but we have new information.

107
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,140
Look, the fair starts
the day after tomorrow,

108
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,840
and it's not too late to reconsider.

109
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,040
<font color="#ffff00">♪</font>

110
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,150
Carol says that the
situation at the Kingdom

111
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,020
is far worse than Ezekiel
let on in his letter.

112
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,120
They're too isolated,

113
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,190
and they need the trade
that this fair will bring.

114
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,340
The Kingdom can take care of itself.

115
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,690
They always have.

116
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,670
Carol wouldn't ask
for help a second time

117
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,300
if it wasn't serious.

118
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,030
I motion the council take a second vote

119
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,700
on the Kingdom's fair.

120
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,000
<font color="#138ce9">GABRIEL:</font> To what end?

121
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,840

122
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,760
The roads leading there
are broken and dangerous,

123
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,680
and there is a group dressed as the dead

124
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
who are trying to kill us.

126
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,990
Look, I wish we could help them, too,

127
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,430
and we could vote

128
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,390
to open up our doors to our friends

129
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,930
just like we did with the
people of the Sanctuary.

130
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,840
I could get behind that.

131
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,040
But Carol made it clear in her letter

132
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,440
that Ezekiel is not ready
to give up the Kingdom,

133
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,440
and I'm not ready to risk
Alexandrian lives over this.

134
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,250
I know that you just
want what's best for us.

135
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,290
But what does it mean
for Alexandria to survive

136
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,090

In this first chart,

the left column enumerates

234
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,030
many of the positive
and negative aspects

235
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,260
of staying with Rosita
while she raises her progeny

236
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,620
with another man.

237
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,890
In the right column,

238
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,660
I've assigned each of these aspects

239
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,920
with a corresponding positive
or negative numeric value.

240
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,280
Then, on chart number two...

241
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,300
Chart number two?

242
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,510
...I've taken the numeric
values from chart one

243
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,640
and estimated their impact over time.

244
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,140
While there is some instability
in the first few years,

245
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,760
happiness shows a
definitive growth pattern

246
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,580

252
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,870

254
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,810
All right.

255
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,480
But if you'll pardon my French,

256
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:55,190
you being a man of the cloth and all...

257
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,390
you'd be a damn fool to let her go.

258

Listen, we've been through
the stew, me and you.

259
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,200
You never gave up on me even when I did.

260
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
Even with bad peepers,
you saw things I didn't.

So let me kick what I'm seein'.

262
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,210
Rosita is the best thing
that's happened to you

since this whole shit storm started,

264
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,960
so you'd do well to ponder
long and hard about this

265
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,410
before tossing the literal baby

266
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,250

in a whole lot of heads.

356

But I didn't.

a dead man if you tried.

take your shot out there,

360

361

381

but it is slipping through your fingers.

386

And it is only a matter of time

387
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,480
before you lose control
of it completely.

My windows to the world

390

Look, all I'm saying is,

394
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,030
I know a thing or two about
keeping people in line.

395
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,160
I could be a sounding board for you.

I'm not the leader here.

Oh, come on.

400
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,820
Now, I heard you wrote
up some constitution

401
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,530
that supposedly gives
power to the people,

402
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,990
and yet you've got it

403
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,670
so you're the one that
makes all the decisions.

404

- I wish I...
- It's not a racket.

407
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,290
And you don't know shit
about what goes on here.

408
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,510
I know that a good leader

409
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,160
uses everything to their advantage.

410
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,530
Sorry, Negan.

411

530
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,540
Why?

531
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,540
I feel sorry for him.

532
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,290
He is not your friend, sweetheart.

533
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,750
Well, obviously.

534
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,080
So if he's not your friend,

535
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,920
then why are you talking to him?

536
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,460
He listens to me.

537
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,660
Not everybody does.

538
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,740
I don't want you to
ever go near him again.

539
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,810
Why not?

540
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,670
There's a reason that
he's in a cage, Judith.

541
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,910
- He is a monster.
- No, he's not.

542
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,510
He's a human being.

543
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,820
But he has done monstrous things.

544
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,450
He's killed people,

545
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,490
people I cared about,
people your dad cared about.

546
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,470
And if we ever let him out,

547
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,640
it would start all over again.

548
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,330
But, Mom, he did get out.

549
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,960
He's not like that anymore.

550
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,540

And it's good to remind them.

573

When Lydia was 3,

574
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,430
I turned my back on
her, just for a minute.

575
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,160
I don't even remember why.

576
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,830
When I went looking, we
found her in the closet,

577
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,900
tangled up in the plastic
from the dry-cleaner.

578
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,470
The plastic was sucking into her mouth.

579
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,940
And I just stood there,

580
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,980
watching as her skin turned blue.

581
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,280
She fell to the floor.

582
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,650
I tore the plastic off her face.

583
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,360
And when her breathing steadied...

584
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,590
I asked her if she was okay.

585
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,430
She nodded.

586
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,370
And then I hit her, hard,

587
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:57,370
so she'd remember never to do it again.

588
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,940

589

590
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,320
even from themselves.

591
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,450
We need to protect ourselves
from the outside, too.

592
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,830
We need to be ready when
they come for the boy.

We already are.

594
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,530
Having him gives us an advantage.

595

He can be useful with Lydia, too.

Keep your head down. We're leaving.

00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,750
Not without Lydia.

706
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,490
No, the girl stays.

707
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,850
Then so do I.

No.

710
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,160
