1
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,614
We deserve to live in peace.

2
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:18,050
Negan and the Saviors tried
to take that away from us.

3
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:22,991
Alexandria, the Hilltop, the
Kingdom, and the Oceanside

4
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:25,959
came together to fight
for a better future.

5
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:28,051
We won...

6
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:30,276
It's not over until he's dead!

7
00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:31,864
not without painful losses.

8
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,269
Today, we try to heal, try to forgive.

9
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:41,523
Now, the work begins,
the new world begins.

10
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,151
___

11
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:15,588
It was very drippy before.

12
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:17,123
Was it drippy? That's okay.

13
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:19,092
It's a... I'm gonna make it into a heart.

14
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,461
Okay, that's fine. That's fine. Go ahead.

15
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:23,296
It's dripping from the heart.

16
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:25,265
- It's okay.
-'Cause the heart's so full.

17
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:27,934
Is that why?

18
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:30,670
Ah. Some is dripping on you.

19
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,939
You want to tell me about the painting?

20
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:35,942
That's our house. And Aunt Maggie.
And the King.

21
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:37,944
All our friends.

22
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:41,314
Who is that grumpy face?

23
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:45,819
You get a grumpy, little face.

24
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:48,154
You doing a grumpy face?

25
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:50,290
He has a happy face, too.

26
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:55,128
There's going to be his big tummy.

27
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:58,832
There's a big tummy.

28
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:00,166
That's Daddy's big tummy?

29
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:37,003
Shoo. Go on.

30
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:43,599
___

31
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:57,390
Daryl.

32
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:14,274
Hey. What the hell you doing?

33
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,409
Scaring the birds away.

34
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:23,616
Sanctuary to
Alexandria Relay One, come in.

35
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:25,118
You hear me, AR One?

36
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:26,219
Loud and clear, Ponytail.

37
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:26,809
What's up?

38
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,482
Crops are done-zo at the Sanctuary.

39
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:31,300
Time to go medieval on this
problem's ass, as it were.

40
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:33,281
Daryl's requesting a run into the city

41
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:35,228
and a backup at the roost.

42
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,563
We meet at the rally point at dawn.
Pass it on. Over.

43
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:38,064
Copy that.

44
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,409
Will you teach me sometime?

45
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,978
I got a kids' class at the
Hilltop you could audit.

46
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:53,479
Maggie'll be there.

47
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:56,249
Carol sometimes shows up
when she's in town, so...

48
00:03:56,282 --> 00:03:57,917
Oh, speaking of...

49
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:01,254
Patrol to Kingdom Relay.

50
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,938
Clear to the rally point, dude.
See you on the flip.

51
00:06:23,374 --> 00:06:26,876
== Re-synced by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

52
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:43,320
We're good for now.

53
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,689
Sweep protocol when we get in.

54
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,314
___

55
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,567
___

56
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:47,367
___

57
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,219
Y'all got your lists.

58
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:52,255
Circle back here when you're done.

59
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:55,959
Be safe.

60
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,497
This is gonna work.

61
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,465
Heads up.

62
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,645
Onward.

63
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,647
We'll figure it out.

64
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:38,755
You okay?

65
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,256
Yeah.

66
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,058
Yeah. Yeah.

67
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,460
Thanks.

68
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,228
There were spiders.

69
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:47,597
I-I don't like spiders.

70
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,553
___

71
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:19,629
Intelligent design.

72
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:22,232
The de-evolution of man.

73
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,168
I like it.

74
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:34,811
You need help with that?

75
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:36,846
Uh, yeah.

76
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,316
Uh, sure.

77
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,022
You all right?

78
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:49,659
I was just, um... just
thinking about my brother.

79
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:54,197
We were fighting during a canoe
ride at the county fair.

80
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,165
It's funny, you know,

81
00:11:56,198 --> 00:12:00,270
how certain things just bring
up random memories like that.

82
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,939
Does it happen to you?

83
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,011
Most of the memories I got of
my brother, we were fighting.

84
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:15,018
But I had friends that fought with me.

85
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:17,620
They wanted to be here.

86
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,523
They didn't make it.

87
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:24,961
So, yeah, it happens to me.

88
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:11,574
You were right, Anne.

89
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:12,909
How'd you know to find seeds here?

90
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:16,846
Brought my class back
when I was teaching.

91
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,682
Found out they cultivated
heirloom lines for the gardens,

92
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,585
and they kept seeds on hand so
they could rotate the crops.

93
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,854
They made a doomsday vault
without knowing it.

94
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,122
We're grateful.

95
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:28,758
The Sanctuary will be, too.

96
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,929
Let's take the lot, get back,
see if the others need help.

97
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,101
So, he called for an election?

98
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:41,371
The one great idea Gregory's had.

99
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,773
Is he still sore about the results?

100
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:46,275
I don't know. He's being friendly.

101
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:49,278
It's weird, honestly.

102
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:53,650
The rebirth of democracy... by that guy.

103
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:55,652
Who'd have thought?

104
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,620
Meanwhile, I live with a King.

105
00:13:57,653 --> 00:14:00,289
But it works, right?

106
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:02,558
People seem to like it.

107
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,472
But there's something about a vote.

108
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:06,361
___

109
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,459
___

110
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,234
Here we go.

111
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,137
Our blacksmith can use these
as a model to make more.

112
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,140
And we can send one to the Sanctuary,

113
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,308
try to fix things there.

114
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:24,480
I'm glad you won your election.

115
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:26,149
I'm glad I grew up on a farm.

116
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,351
All right. Easy.

117
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:32,188
Last step. Easy.

118
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,333
All right, hold... hold!

119
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,606
So far, so good.

120
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,870
Let's go.

121
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,408
Easy. Slow, slow, slow.

122
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,877
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa.

123
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,545
Okay. All right.

124
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:30,880
Watch your fingers.

125
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,048
- Last step.
- One more.

126
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:33,816
Hold, hold!

127
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:48,120
No sudden moves. Just
keep going nice and slow.

128
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:11,105
You got to go!

129
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,507
Save the plow!

130
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:19,180
Ezekiel!

131
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:22,850
Ezekiel!

132
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:24,518
Hold on!

133
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,520
Aah! Aah! Aah!

134
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:05,993
Come on.

135
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,106
Oh, God.

136
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:35,923
You're good.

137
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:17,277
___

138
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,890
Hey, Ken, Marco here thinks
he wants to learn the trade.

139
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:04,793
Think your dad'll take
on another apprentice?

140
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:06,294
I don't see why not.

141
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:08,563
I can't tell if he likes me.

142
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:09,898
He's just quiet.

143
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:12,400
I mean, it comes across as grumpy.

144
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:14,970
I don't think I've ever
seen the guy smile.

145
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:18,573
All right, it's just, he needs
to get to know you first.

146
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:20,442
Look, I think he'd
appreciate the extra help

147
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:22,310
'cause the Kingdom just
sent in this large shipment

148
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:24,946
of scrap metal to melt down.

149
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:27,782
Hell, shoeing these horses
is a full-time job.

150
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:29,317
If it makes you feel any better,

151
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,986
I was pretty sure he hated me, too.

152
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:34,489
I was scared back there.

153
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:36,291
I was, too.

154
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:40,595
I'm glad you're okay.

155
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:45,500
It made me remember something

156
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,669
I've been taking for granted lately.

157
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:51,606
We can't wait on life, so... -Don't.

158
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:54,076
will you marry me?

159
00:20:57,678 --> 00:20:58,680
Put that thing away.

160
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:01,783
It'll snag on everything.

161
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:03,518
And I told you not to ask me that.

162
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:04,853
I know.

163
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:06,521
Especially after something like this.

164
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:09,290
And this is not happening on a horse.

165
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:16,131
I love you.

166
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:18,967
And I always will.

167
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,836
I'll keep this till you're ready.

168
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:38,520
Two other herds merged into "Silvia,"

169
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:39,854
so now it's even bigger.

170
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:41,322
One of them came through here,

171
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:43,324
and the back end took down the bridge.

172
00:21:43,357 --> 00:21:45,860
Took the walkie repeater with it.

173
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:48,563
What about Route A?
Is that clear yet?

174
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,365
It's still too close to the herd.

175
00:21:50,398 --> 00:21:52,500
We can get to Alexandria from this side,

176
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,002
stay there till it passes.

177
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:56,704
No.

178
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:58,339
Route A has taken days to clear before.

179
00:21:58,372 --> 00:21:59,841
I need to get home to Hershel.

180
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:02,677
We could take Route D. It's
early enough in the day.

181
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,978
Keep an eye on the trade road

182
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:06,047
in case anyone else
tries to move through.

183
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,350
Gabriel, y'all can head back
to Alexandria from here.

184
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:13,354
The rest of us... we can go
to the Sanctuary or Hilltop,

185
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:15,266
stay the night, and head off from there.

186
00:22:16,057 --> 00:22:19,360
Take care. Get home safe.

187
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:23,098
___

188
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:40,248
Rick, the horses can't
pull the wagon through this mud.

189
00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:46,721
Maggie, I think they need a break.

190
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,293
Maybe we should leave the supplies,

191
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:53,732
send a group back in a day or two.

192
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:54,569
It's risky.

193
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:56,274
We've seen herds run through

194
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,799
and destroy bigger things than this.

195
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,137
We can swap out the horses, split up,

196
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,073
take 'em out in the
clear, give 'em a rest

197
00:23:05,106 --> 00:23:07,775
while we see what we can
do about the trailers.

198
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:09,110
One, two, three.

199
00:23:16,684 --> 00:23:19,287
Rick.

200
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:24,826
We're almost there.

201
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:26,261
One more time.

202
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:27,929
One, two, three.

203
00:23:37,805 --> 00:23:40,108
Good. Let's get out of here.

204
00:23:42,476 --> 00:23:44,946
Daryl, Michonne.

205
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:46,614
On it.

206
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:31,726
We gotta go. Leave the wagon!

207
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:36,898
I gotta free her!

208
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:39,033
Ken, wait!

209
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:43,338
Aah!

210
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:52,013
Come on.

211
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:55,850
They're gonna fix it.
You're gonna be all right.

212
00:24:55,883 --> 00:24:57,385
I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna...

213
00:24:57,418 --> 00:24:59,187
- Yeah. Look at me.
- You're gonna be all right.

214
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,190
- Come on.
- You'll be okay.

215
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:06,094
They're gonna fix it.
You're gonna be all right.

216
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:10,064
- We'll keep the walkers away.
- Okay.

217
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:13,268
Enid, get the quick clot
and a... and a tourniquet.

218
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:15,069
Here.

219
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,704
Tell my dad to let Marco
take my place, okay?

220
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:20,375
Hey, you're gonna talk to
your dad yourself, okay?

221
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:22,543
Just stay awake. Stay awake.

222
00:25:22,576 --> 00:25:25,747
Okay.

223
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,216
Ken, Ken, just stay awake.

224
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:30,752
Ken, look at me. Ken.

225
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:34,222
Tell my mom and dad I'm... I'm comin'.

226
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:37,625
Ken.

227
00:25:44,598 --> 00:25:46,267
Ken?

228
00:26:58,172 --> 00:27:00,141
Tell me again.

229
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:02,043
Tammy.

230
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:04,479
Tell me again. Tell me what happened.

231
00:27:04,512 --> 00:27:07,315
Tammy, she's already said
everything there is to say.

232
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:08,716
I don't accept that.

233
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:10,985
She took our boy out there, and for what?

234
00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:13,988
My son is dead, Earl!

235
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:15,990
And what do we have to show for it?

236
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:17,992
Nothing but a broke plow.
Isn't that right?

237
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:19,494
We found more than just a plow.

238
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:21,162
That run was really
important for the future.

239
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:24,565
Don't you dare talk to me
about no future right now.

240
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:26,501
I know where all that shit went, Maggie.

241
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:28,169
The Saviors got it, didn't they?

242
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:30,671
He didn't even die helping Hilltop!

243
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:32,507
Tammy, just calm down.

244
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,843
You think I'm gonna hit that little girl?

245
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:37,879
I ain't that woman.

246
00:27:37,912 --> 00:27:40,915
But what kind of man are
you just to let this go?

247
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:51,859
I'm no kind of man at all.

248
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:54,028
Oh, no, I didn't...

249
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:06,441
If you'll let me, I'd like
to help arrange a funeral.

250
00:28:06,474 --> 00:28:09,777
Me and Earl will bury our boy, thank you.

251
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,447
And you're not welcome there.

252
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,951
I voted for you, Maggie Rhee,
but we're not friends.

253
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:19,620
I understand. I really do.

254
00:28:19,653 --> 00:28:22,123
You know, Gregory has been saying

255
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:26,093
he's the one who's always
put Hilltop first.

256
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:28,896
The man's a damn scoundrel...

257
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:31,399
but maybe he's no fool.

258
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:36,237
My son is dead. Your boy has no father.

259
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,907
And those damn Saviors eat our food

260
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,278
and take everything
that Hilltop bled for.

261
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:47,448
It ain't right.

262
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:58,651
# 'Tis the last rose of summer #

263
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:02,322
# Left blooming alone #

264
00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:05,892
# All her lovely companions #

265
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:10,597
# Are faded and gone #

266
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,567
# No flower of her kindred #

267
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,738
# No rosebud is nigh #

268
00:29:18,771 --> 00:29:22,408
# To reflect back her blushes #

269
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:27,080
# Or to give sigh for sigh #

270
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:30,917
# And so soon may I follow #

271
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:35,088
# When friendships decay #

272
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:39,125
# And from love's shining circle #

273
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:42,795
# The gems drop away #

274
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:46,466
# When true hearts lie withered #

275
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:49,469
# And fond ones are flown #

276
00:29:49,502 --> 00:29:53,272
# Oh, who would inhabit #

277
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:55,608
# This bleak world alone? #

278
00:29:57,343 --> 00:29:59,646
I'm gonna miss you, Ken.

279
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,981
Heaven's a better place for having you.

280
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:03,983
Cheers.

281
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:11,958
Rick Grimes is here!

282
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:15,628
That's the man that ended the war.

283
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:18,831
Is Negan suffering? I
hope he damn well is.

284
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:19,966
Hello.

285
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,234
All was well in your absence,

286
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:23,069
other than a certain cabal of Saviors

287
00:30:23,102 --> 00:30:24,837
slingin' me some serious stink-eye,

288
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,806
but I've compiled a
list of items that need

289
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,307
your semi-immediate attention.

290
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,143
- Not now, man.
- I checked out the supplies.

291
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:31,678
It's a pretty good haul. You
should let everybody know.

292
00:30:31,711 --> 00:30:33,813
I ain't getting up on a stage

293
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:36,249
and giving a damn speech like him.

294
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,853
It's bad timing. We just
lost someone out there.

295
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,092
Daryl.

296
00:30:49,711 --> 00:30:50,783
Does this happen often?

297
00:30:50,802 --> 00:30:52,384
___

298
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,868
More and more since the crops been dyin'.

299
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,371
Eugene, Jerry!

300
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:00,173
You know who did that?

301
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:03,476
- Don't know, man.
- That would be a negative.

302
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:08,548
Justin. Clean that up.

303
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:10,850
How?

304
00:31:10,883 --> 00:31:13,052
What do you mean, "how"? Paint over it.

305
00:31:13,085 --> 00:31:14,520
We just used up all the paint.

306
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:16,690
Figure it out.

307
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:32,205
Ken was a quiet, good-hearted young man.

308
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:35,541
He wasn't a fighter.

309
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,376
Uh, he... he tended to our animals.

310
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:40,413
He... He shoed the horses.

311
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:44,917
It's regular guys like Ken
that keep a place going.

312
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:48,488
He will be remembered

313
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:54,727
as a son, a friend...

314
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,896
a-a-a shining example

315
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:02,435
of Hilltop's strength and
fundamental decency,

316
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:07,273
even in the face of
this terrible tragedy.

317
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,012
Cheers, Ken.

318
00:32:13,045 --> 00:32:15,414
Rest in peace.

319
00:32:24,957 --> 00:32:26,592
Gregory.

320
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,362
That was beautiful.

321
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:31,798
Something like this
really makes you think

322
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:35,201
about what you have and what you've lost.

323
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:39,205
And I'm just...

324
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:42,041
I'm just grateful for where I am.

325
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:11,470
You see our crops, Rick?

326
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:13,139
I did.

327
00:33:13,172 --> 00:33:16,342
The spring storms will be here
in a few weeks, help us out,

328
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,144
but we need a boost in the meantime.

329
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:19,345
And you'll have it.

330
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:20,680
We came back

331
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:23,416
with farming tools, heirloom seeds.

332
00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:26,018
We're looking to the past to
help us with the present.

333
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:27,587
We're all gonna pitch in and make sure

334
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,488
that Sanctuary has what it needs

335
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:31,490
so you all can get back on your feet.

336
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:34,994
Bless you, Rick Grimes. Thank you.

337
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:58,217
What's up?

338
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,186
I don't wanna be the one

339
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:03,689
leading these people anymore.

340
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:05,725
Okay.

341
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:06,993
Why?

342
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:08,227
I don't know.

343
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,364
Bein' here behind these walls again...

344
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:13,199
it just don't feel right, man.

345
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:15,968
I'm better out there.

346
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:17,703
I always have been.

347
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,209
You kept this place together.

348
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:26,212
You kept people in line here.

349
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:28,381
We can't just let the Sanctuary fail

350
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:30,049
after everything that's happened.

351
00:34:30,082 --> 00:34:32,718
Man, it's gonna fail anyway.

352
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:37,890
Nothing grows here. It's
a damn factory, man.

353
00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:39,225
Look, when Negan was around,

354
00:34:39,258 --> 00:34:41,827
he needed people to provide for him.

355
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,596
It's still the same. Nothing's changed.

356
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:47,767
It's different now. We give
what we give willingly.

357
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,836
How long's that gonna last?

358
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:53,906
Most of the bridges are
out after the big storm.

359
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:56,409
The highway's done.

360
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:59,779
We've scavenged every
drop of gas for miles.

361
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:01,247
And we can't make enough corn fuel

362
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,616
to run the cars or the trucks.

363
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:05,418
Pretty soon, it's gonna
be more than a day's ride

364
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:07,420
from one spot to another.

365
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:10,556
Well, it's on us to figure
out how to make it work.

366
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,027
Man, there ain't no "us" anymore.

367
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,864
Everyone's everywhere.

368
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:23,436
That small group we had
back in the beginning...

369
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:25,938
we could do anything.

370
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:27,540
That was right.

371
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:29,609
That's what I know.

372
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:36,983
Well, you wanna come home
to Alexandria, then?

373
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:38,985
No.

374
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:42,789
I'll go back to Hilltop, check
on Maggie and the baby.

375
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:50,129
Well, you go, someone's
got to take your place.

376
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:52,798
Rosita and Eugene are
headed to Oceanside next.

377
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,900
Maggie's sending food, but not people,

378
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:56,836
and Kingdom's got its
own problems rebuilding

379
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:58,304
after losing its fighters.

380
00:35:58,337 --> 00:36:00,239
If Alexandria sends another person out,

381
00:36:00,272 --> 00:36:03,242
I could use the help back home.

382
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:11,150
Huh.

383
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:15,021
We're not together because
things have changed.

384
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:18,524
Mm-hmm.

385
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:21,260
The thing is, you changed them, Rick.

386
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:27,633
But I get it.

387
00:36:43,816 --> 00:36:46,285
Bless you, but no thank you.

388
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:49,622
Oh, that's right. You're sober.

389
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:51,457
You too?

390
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:55,795
Go ahead, Tammy. I'm fine.

391
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:27,893
I don't know what to do, Tammy.

392
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:29,228
What am I supposed to do?

393
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:31,063
I just... I just want to be by myself.

394
00:37:31,096 --> 00:37:33,165
I just want to sleep.

395
00:37:33,198 --> 00:37:34,233
I can leave.

396
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:36,902
Don't. Don't.

397
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:39,338
I-I just want to sleep.

398
00:38:07,299 --> 00:38:09,268
I'll, uh...

399
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:12,505
I-I'll sit with you, if you'd like.

400
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:37,335
Those things'll kill you.

401
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:46,076
Why aren't you in bed?

402
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:47,612
Why aren't you?

403
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:53,450
We don't sleep.

404
00:38:53,483 --> 00:38:56,553
Ezekiel, on the other
hand, sleeps like a baby.

405
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:57,955
It's annoying.

406
00:38:57,988 --> 00:39:00,224
Does he snore fancy, too?

407
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:02,526
Stop it.

408
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:06,897
No, he's all right.

409
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,768
He's a bit corny, but...

410
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:13,471
Glad I have Pookie's approval.

411
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:19,610
After what I went through with Ed,

412
00:39:19,643 --> 00:39:22,380
corny is really, really nice.

413
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:28,919
No. I'm happy for you.

414
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,555
If anybody deserves to
be happy, it's you.

415
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:37,328
I don't like not seein' you, though.

416
00:39:42,165 --> 00:39:43,267
Daryl.

417
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,169
Hmm?

418
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,007
I want to take over here
for awhile, for you,

419
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,942
and don't argue.

420
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,781
You gonna bring Henry
and the King with you?

421
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,918
I haven't told him yet.

422
00:40:04,654 --> 00:40:06,690
He asked me to marry him.

423
00:40:06,723 --> 00:40:09,293
What?

424
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:12,796
Yeah.

425
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:16,667
And a part of me wanted to
just say "yes" right then.

426
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,170
Why didn't you?

427
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:22,806
I don't know.

428
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,876
I want to help out,

429
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:28,045
take my time, you know?

430
00:40:33,216 --> 00:40:36,887
You want me to stay here with you?

431
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,889
No.

432
00:40:48,932 --> 00:40:51,001
I'll tell you something else, Gregory.

433
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:53,203
He didn't need to be out there.

434
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,741
My son...

435
00:40:57,774 --> 00:41:00,677
My son didn't need to die.

436
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,678
No, he didn't.

437
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,415
Where's the justice for my boy?

438
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:10,821
Well, Maggie thinks she's above the law.

439
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:17,027
You know that election?

440
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,430
It's a joke.

441
00:41:20,463 --> 00:41:24,067
Who do you think counted those ballots?

442
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,270
Her buddy Jesus... that's who.

443
00:41:28,939 --> 00:41:30,774
Y-You know, I-I've talked
to a lot of people,

444
00:41:30,807 --> 00:41:32,876
and they're not happy with
the way things are going.

445
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:34,044
Huh.

446
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:38,215
They're just afraid to speak up.

447
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,250
Maggie will do whatever
her pal Rick says,

448
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:42,753
even if it's not good for Hilltop.

449
00:41:44,988 --> 00:41:46,223
I don't see that we can do

450
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:49,059
a hell of a lot about it, Gregory.

451
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:52,396
She's the one that decides those things.

452
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,899
Well, it is the decisions she's made

453
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:57,601
and the priorities she set

454
00:41:57,634 --> 00:42:01,972
that put your boy into the ground.

455
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:07,911
I'm speaking plainly because I'm angry.

456
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:10,747
I'm angry to see the
lives at the Hilltop...

457
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,250
your son's life... being
treated like the price

458
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:16,587
of doing someone else's business.

459
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:20,958
She's the leader.

460
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:27,798
She doesn't have to be.

461
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:14,378
The famous Rick Grimes.

462
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:16,213
Oh, god damn it, don't you start, too.

463
00:43:18,415 --> 00:43:20,550
It's sweet.

464
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:21,985
Just don't let it get to your head.

465
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,823
No, not today, that's for sure.

466
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:31,561
Mm. Yeah.

467
00:43:31,594 --> 00:43:34,164
I don't envy Maggie right now.

468
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:37,001
No.

469
00:43:42,952 --> 00:43:44,354
Rick?

470
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:47,290
Hmm?

471
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:50,260
Seeing his name on the wall...

472
00:43:53,963 --> 00:43:56,433
Did we do the right thing?

473
00:43:57,733 --> 00:44:01,270
Sometimes I think maybe we
just should have killed him.

474
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:05,608
Yeah. I think about it a lot.

475
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:10,613
But killing him wouldn't have
changed anything we saw today.

476
00:44:10,646 --> 00:44:12,615
They don't want Negan. They want food.

477
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:17,387
We don't know that, Rick, not for sure.

478
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,956
I've been thinking.

479
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:23,726
Maybe we need an agreement
between all the communities,

480
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:27,063
like, "This is what we believe,

481
00:44:27,096 --> 00:44:29,399
this is how we treat each other,

482
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:32,402
and this is what happens when we don't."

483
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:38,141
Yeah. It's good.

484
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:41,911
It feels like the right time.

485
00:44:41,944 --> 00:44:43,413
We... We couldn't before.

486
00:44:43,446 --> 00:44:45,815
We were always running and fighting.

487
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:47,984
No. It's smart.

488
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:49,652
Building up something like that...

489
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:52,255
it could pull people closer together.

490
00:44:56,692 --> 00:45:00,496
You know, Daryl's not happy.

491
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:03,499
He's got me worried about
things breaking down.

492
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:06,436
He wouldn't say something
unless it was important.

493
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:08,504
He cares.

494
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:11,708
Too much sometimes.

495
00:45:11,741 --> 00:45:13,342
Hey.

496
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,945
If he's worried, there's a reason.

497
00:45:18,214 --> 00:45:22,018
So, what do we do about it?

498
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:25,188
I think we need to fix that bridge.

499
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:26,656
Okay.

500
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:30,026
I'll get the people to
agree to a charter.

501
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:31,694
Charter?

502
00:45:31,727 --> 00:45:33,797
Not Constitution?

503
00:45:36,098 --> 00:45:37,734
Charter.

504
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:39,902
Okay.

505
00:45:39,935 --> 00:45:42,038
But tomorrow.

506
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:43,039
- Yeah.
- Okay?

507
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:45,208
Mm. Yeah.

508
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:08,665
How'd I get so lucky finding you?

509
00:46:14,036 --> 00:46:17,673
We've both lost enough.

510
00:46:17,706 --> 00:46:20,743
It's time we won a
little, don't you think?

511
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,625
The famous Rick Grimes.

512
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:43,366
Ah.

513
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:45,368
Tough night?

514
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,106
Yeah. Tough night.

515
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:51,707
I've been there.

516
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,875
I'm sorry.

517
00:46:52,908 --> 00:46:55,211
I appreciate that.

518
00:46:57,313 --> 00:46:59,949
I know this hasn't been easy for you.

519
00:46:59,982 --> 00:47:02,118
You won the election
fair and square, Maggie.

520
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:04,788
You've been a worthy adversary.

521
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:10,126
Forced me to do some soul-searching.

522
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,062
It's hard not knowing what your place is.

523
00:47:13,095 --> 00:47:15,231
I'm sure you have one if you want it.

524
00:47:15,264 --> 00:47:17,633
Yeah, well...

525
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:21,170
Anyway, I should get my kid to sleep.

526
00:47:21,203 --> 00:47:24,574
Oh, Maggie, I meant to tell you...

527
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:27,176
when we were burying Ken before,

528
00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:30,346
I didn't want to say
anything... not now...

529
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:32,849
but it looked like

530
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:36,352
someone had defaced Glenn's grave.

531
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:38,154
Maybe just some sort of accident

532
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:40,923
or kids didn't know any better.

533
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:45,194
Uh, I hope it wasn't
that someone was angry.

534
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:52,034
Probably no big deal.
Check it out tomorrow.

535
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:54,337
- Good night.
- Night.

536
00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:21,564
Oh, my God, Maggie!

537
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:43,552
Margaret...

538
00:48:44,853 --> 00:48:46,489
My God, Maggie, w-what happened?

539
00:48:46,522 --> 00:48:48,391
What happened?

540
00:48:48,424 --> 00:48:49,892
You tried to have me killed

541
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:51,227
'cause you're too chicken-shit
to do it yourself.

542
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,596
Margaret, you... you need to sit down.

543
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:55,731
You obviously h-have a head injury.

544
00:48:55,764 --> 00:48:58,601
You want to lead this place?

545
00:48:58,634 --> 00:49:00,736
You can't even murder someone right.

546
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:03,239
This place?

547
00:49:03,272 --> 00:49:05,408
I built this place!

548
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:08,744
None of this would exist
if it wasn't for me.

549
00:49:08,777 --> 00:49:10,613
You're just Rick's lackey.

550
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:11,914
Rick ended the war.

551
00:49:11,947 --> 00:49:13,950
That's more than you ever did.

552
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,852
And he's your friend and your mentor.

553
00:49:16,885 --> 00:49:18,854
You know what's funny,

554
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:20,623
is you can't go back to Alexandria

555
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:23,359
because you-know-who is still there.

556
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:25,528
Do you even give a crap

557
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:28,931
about all of the stupid
shit that you have done?

558
00:49:28,964 --> 00:49:31,434
After all the chances
that you've been given?

559
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:32,768
No.

560
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,438
Because I'm still here.

561
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:38,941
They'll all know that you did this.

562
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:40,810
Earl attacked you because
you got his son killed!

563
00:49:43,245 --> 00:49:46,148
You blamed me. You attacked me.

564
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:48,617
And I defended myself.

565
00:50:08,894 --> 00:50:10,663
I'll see you soon.

566
00:50:11,931 --> 00:50:14,533
Give Henry a kiss for me.

567
00:50:20,038 --> 00:50:21,807
I'm not running away.

568
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,343
It kind of feels like you are.

569
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:25,544
If I pushed too hard...

570
00:50:25,577 --> 00:50:28,881
No. My friends need my help.

571
00:50:28,914 --> 00:50:32,518
And I want to be there for them.

572
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:34,720
But I have a home I want to get back to,

573
00:50:34,753 --> 00:50:37,823
and that's enough for me for now.

574
00:50:37,856 --> 00:50:40,893
I hope it is for you, too.

575
00:50:40,926 --> 00:50:42,661
I'll be content

576
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:46,732
to move at your speed, Lady Carol.

577
00:50:52,771 --> 00:50:55,674
Though the waiting is such sweet sorrow.

578
00:50:57,542 --> 00:51:00,079
Jerry, our steeds.

579
00:51:02,547 --> 00:51:05,684
Jerry, take care of them for
me, just for a little bit.

580
00:51:05,717 --> 00:51:08,754
You got it, boss.

581
00:52:10,482 --> 00:52:12,318
It's funny.

582
00:52:12,351 --> 00:52:13,419
And he knows it.

583
00:52:13,452 --> 00:52:14,987
He's a little stinker.

584
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:18,957
He's just perfect.

585
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,592
He really is.

586
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,961
Yeah.

587
00:52:22,994 --> 00:52:24,530
I think I'll keep him.

588
00:52:25,997 --> 00:52:27,933
Come here.

589
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:35,107
Okay. Here you go.

590
00:52:39,211 --> 00:52:41,313
Don't go running off.

591
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:49,288
Now that Hershel's a little older

592
00:52:49,321 --> 00:52:53,292
and you're going on runs again

593
00:52:53,325 --> 00:52:55,961
I'd love for you to visit
Alexandria sometime,

594
00:52:55,994 --> 00:52:59,298
if you're up for it.

595
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:02,968
Judith talks about Aunt Maggie
at Hilltop all the time.

596
00:53:04,569 --> 00:53:07,473
I'm surprised she still
remembers you, but she does.

597
00:53:07,506 --> 00:53:09,975
Rick, I can't. You know I can't.

598
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:17,683
But you came about something else.

599
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:19,885
Oh.

600
00:53:19,918 --> 00:53:22,187
Maggie, it can... it can wait.

601
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,556
I'm okay.

602
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:28,193
Just talk to me about
anything else, please.

603
00:53:30,395 --> 00:53:32,598
All right.

604
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:38,170
Well...

605
00:53:38,203 --> 00:53:42,074
I need your help fixing the bridge.

606
00:53:42,107 --> 00:53:46,178
Hilltop's thriving because of you.

607
00:53:46,211 --> 00:53:48,714
This place is doing better
than anywhere else,

608
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:52,251
and you've been generous.

609
00:53:52,284 --> 00:53:55,087
Hilltop's given so much already,

610
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,056
but I'm asking for more.

611
00:53:58,089 --> 00:53:59,725
What?

612
00:53:59,758 --> 00:54:01,760
Sanctuary's still short on food,

613
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:03,562
and a project like this is gonna take

614
00:54:03,595 --> 00:54:05,898
a lot of people and supplies.

615
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,901
I'm asking if you'll be generous again,

616
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:10,803
if you'll stretch.

617
00:54:13,939 --> 00:54:17,042
If my people want to work on
the bridge, I won't stop them.

618
00:54:20,078 --> 00:54:21,880
But no more food and supplies

619
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:24,216
without getting something back for it.

620
00:54:24,249 --> 00:54:25,751
What do you want?

621
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:31,123
If the Sanctuary needs
food, I'll give it to 'em.

622
00:54:31,156 --> 00:54:34,393
But... they provide

623
00:54:34,426 --> 00:54:38,730
most of the labor on the bridge for us.

624
00:54:38,763 --> 00:54:40,265
And they send over all the fuel

625
00:54:40,298 --> 00:54:41,800
they've been making from their dead corn.

626
00:54:44,102 --> 00:54:46,438
S-Sanctuary's barely
holding on right now.

627
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:47,940
We're obliged to help.

628
00:54:47,973 --> 00:54:51,477
Why? They surrendered.

629
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,079
We didn't kill 'em.

630
00:54:54,112 --> 00:54:56,782
That's it.

631
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:58,283
I can't solve all their problems

632
00:54:58,316 --> 00:55:00,486
when I clearly have things
to take care of here.

633
00:55:02,487 --> 00:55:04,990
Maggie, I'm so sorry this
happened to you and Enid...

634
00:55:05,023 --> 00:55:09,595
I've survived worse.

635
00:55:09,628 --> 00:55:11,296
But it has to stop.

636
00:55:25,977 --> 00:55:28,447
When we were fighting the Saviors,

637
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,818
you told me that soon, you'd
be the one following me.

638
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:34,186
But you didn't.

639
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:39,157
'Cause I wasn't someone to follow.

640
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:42,794
That changes now.

641
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:53,472
It'll be dark soon.

642
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,810
It's time to put the children to bed.

643
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:24,656
I don't want to do this.

644
00:56:26,938 --> 00:56:29,575
But people need to
understand that at Hilltop,

645
00:56:29,608 --> 00:56:31,209
the punishment fits the crime.

646
00:56:42,354 --> 00:56:44,923
Do you have any final words?

647
00:56:52,797 --> 00:56:56,368
What you're doing isn't right.

648
00:56:56,401 --> 00:56:59,271
Somebody stop this, please.

649
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:05,577
Killing me in the dead of
night because you're ashamed.

650
00:57:07,312 --> 00:57:08,427
You're wrong.

651
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:11,883
I'm not ashamed.

652
00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:21,226
Stop this! Please!

653
00:57:21,259 --> 00:57:25,097
Now, for the love of God, stop it!

654
00:57:27,766 --> 00:57:29,416
- Maggie, stop!
- No, no!

655
00:57:29,438 --> 00:57:30,569
Wait!

656
00:57:37,008 --> 00:57:38,644
Get the children back in bed.

657
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:48,587
I made this decision.

658
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,923
But this is not the
beginning of something.

659
00:57:51,956 --> 00:57:55,293
I don't want to go through it again.

660
00:58:07,406 --> 00:58:08,858
Cut him down.
