I have this moment,

421
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:43,566
usually right when I
wake up, this feeling...

422
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:45,568
that I should...

423
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,337

Why?

497
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:11,510
For supplies.

498
00:34:11,513 --> 00:34:13,690
For my people.

499
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:21,702
It didn't start that way.
It just...

500
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:24,272
It just ended up there.

501
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:27,310
I don't know what the hell
that means.

502
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:29,113
I tried.

503
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:31,884
You saw I tried...

504
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:33,721
at Alexandria.

505
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,391
But the first thing that
goes wrong,

506
00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:38,328
and they suspect me.

507
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:41,332
Rick suspects me.

508
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:43,401
And when those Saviors
came at me,

509
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:46,037
everyone stood by.

510
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,341
Except for you.

511
00:34:52,408 --> 00:34:55,642
Gabriel...

512
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:58,011
leave with me.

513
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,266
What?

514
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:01,289
And... And... And go where?

515
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:03,059
There's another place.

516
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:04,851
It's far from here,

517
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:08,021
but if we go together,
we can get there.

518
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,024
It can be different for us.

519
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,589
There's only one thing.

520
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,993
You can't tell anyone.

521
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:32,997
But if you can trust me...

522
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,849
and help me with one
small part of the deal...

523
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:39,685
we can have a life
like you can't imagine.

524
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,131
Whatever this is, I can't do it.

525
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:55,467
I have to tell Rick.

526
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:58,070
You can't choose me?

527
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,039
Instead?

528
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,547
Not like this.

529
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:14,719
And all this time...

530
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:17,588

And seeing as how we're
being hunted and all,

549

maybe it won't come

My mother and my grandmother

603
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:13,284
found this place for the group.

604
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:16,387
There were so many of us then.

605
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:20,091
Men and women...

607
00:41:23,696 --> 00:41:27,531
My mom and I built a garden.

608
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:31,702
Me and my brother used
to play right here.

609
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:34,397
But then the Saviors came.

610
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:39,803
And Simon wanted what we had.

611
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:45,916
He gave us our final warning.

612
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:50,487
Afterward, we ran.

613
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:52,723
And we tried to forget.

614
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,629
But, then, your people
came and asked us to fight.

615
00:41:58,631 --> 00:42:02,108
We did because we couldn't forget.

616

617
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:09,340
we went along because we
didn't think we had a choice.
