1
00:00:00,642 --> 00:00:03,026
There is one rule between our people.

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:04,861
Stay where you are.

3
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:07,823
Yet you disobey.

4
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:09,859
Previously on "The Walking Dead"...

5
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:11,368
The bitch has to die.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,163
The creek, the border, the tree...

7
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:16,615
it will crush them.

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,784
- How's Rosita?
- She caught a little bug.

9
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:21,287
- She okay?
- Not yet.

10
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,624
Alright, you big-ass freak.

11
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,526
Let's do this.

12
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,206
Hi.

13
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:08,188
Hey.

14
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:10,004
Feelin' better?

15
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,231
Yeah. Thanks.

16
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,566
Where you goin'?

17
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,928
Mm, gonna do another sweep for Negan.

18
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:17,824
Cool. You want company?

19
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,855
Think Negan crossed the border?

20
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:31,266
He'd know we couldn't
follow him over there.

21
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:34,177
I can't see him puttin' on a mask.

22
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:36,513
Or staying quiet for long.

23
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:39,075
Still, stranger things have happened.

24
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:45,021
We takin' a break?

25
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:46,523
Nope.

26
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:49,602
This is our spot today.

27
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,770
Gonna stay here...

28
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,772
see what we see.

29
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,291
He ain't gonna wander around,

30
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,718
waitin' to get spotted.

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,112
He ain't that dumb.

32
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,114
Neither are you.

33
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,517
Gee, thanks.

34
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:12,549
You wanna tell me what
we're doin' out here?

35
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,126
Lookin' for Negan.

36
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,075
Right.

37
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:18,736
You gonna tell me what
we're really lookin' for?

38
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,157
Alpha's horde.

39
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,995
We're gonna find it, and
we're gonna destroy it.

40

41
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,873
Come on. Admit it.

42
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:27,272
There's a tiny part of you
that's thrilled to be sick.

43
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,794
Just so you can spend more time with me.

44
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:32,295
You think I'm pukin'

45
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:34,524
because I got a little crush?

46
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:37,485
Textbook case of
butterflies in the stomach.

47
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,636
I want a second opinion.

48
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:43,398
Oh, it's simple science, darlin'.

49
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,159
Bodies manifest emotion

50
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,645
in all sorts of different ways.

51
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:52,391
The heart wants what it wants.

52
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,169
Right? Inhale for me.

53
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,246
Good.

54
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:59,414
And exhale.

55
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,658
Alright.

56
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,827
Seriously, though,

57
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:07,406
don't you think we'd
make a bitchin' couple?

58
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,136
Son, I would break you like a twig.

59
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,881
How's he doin', Cheryl?

60
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:13,762
Jury's still out.

61
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:15,189
Ouch.

62
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:17,599
I thought we were havin'
a moment here, Cheryl.

63
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:21,270
Is she okay? Everything alright?

64
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:22,530
Yeah.

65
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,848
Couple more cases of that stomach bug.

66
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,777
- So that makes it seven.
- Yeah.

67
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,897
You know, maybe I should just

68
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,824
- put Coco down for a minute...
- Don't worry about it, man.

69
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:35,685
- I got it.
- Sure?

70
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:37,694
Yeah. How's Rosita?

71
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:40,789
Ah, same as everybody else, it seems.

72
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,699
The most we can do is keep 'em hydrated

73
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,459
and wait it out.

74
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:45,755
Mm-hmm.

75
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:49,280
Hey, lap up the daddy/daughter
shit while you can,

76
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:52,470
because they grow so damn fast.

77
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:58,881
Okay, a-alright, easy. Dude, easy.

78
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:01,476
Have some boundaries.

79
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:03,229
Okay.

80
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,582
My bad.

81
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:06,826
You two should go out, have some fun.

82
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:09,642
Alright, thanks.

83
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,437
And if you need me to
peek at Rosita later,

84
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,971
just say the word.

85
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,898
Happy to, you know,

86
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,917
make sure she's on the mend.

87
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,573
That's one of those boundaries again.

88
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,408
Yep.

89
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,910
Yeah.

90
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:28,578
Noted.

91
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,887
Alpha's been sending waves of walkers

92
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,466
to screw with us, right?

93
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,807
Well, I've been tracking walker
movement along the border.

94
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,926
Small groups.

95
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,926
Some of them might
have Whisperers in them.

96
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:42,217
But they all connect right
back to this general area,

97
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:45,009
so I figure we stake out this spot.

98
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:46,770
See where the Whisperers go.

99
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,532
Might lead us back to the horde.

100
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:49,933
That's smart.

101
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:51,285
I thought so.

102
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,012
She's gonna need a place, though,

103
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,773
like the canyon they used to be in.

104
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,868
Only spots I know are on
Whisperer territory, though.

105
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,187
Not gonna be able to sneak in there

106
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,189
without startin' up some kind of shit.

107
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,783
We only need to figure
out where they are,

108
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:08,594
and then we'll tell
the council. I swear.

109
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:13,331
Why weren't you straight with me before?

110
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,311
After what happened at
the border and with Alpha,

111
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,963
I didn't want you to worry.

112
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,440
Sorry.

113
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:23,800
I get it.

114
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:26,320
Just wanna keep us safe.

115
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:30,232
So, you gonna stick around?

116
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,217
Well, if you spot somethin',

117
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,220
you're gonna need me to track it, right?

118
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,497
I dunno.

119
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:39,983
Picked up a few things over the years.

120
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,324
Yeah, we'll see.

121
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:48,825
Honestly, fellas... or ladies.

122
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:51,661
Kinda hard to tell
underneath the outfits.

123
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,276
I wanna join, alright?

124
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,537
I am a joiner.

125
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,850
Get me a damn application already.

126
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,335
I mean, look at you guys, right?

127
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:00,595
Cool-ass outfits,

128
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,839
the whole back-to-nature paleo vibe?

129
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:05,008
You are a survivalist's wet dream.

130
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,011
Not to mention the
number-one selling point...

131
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:10,605
no more bein' eaten by the dead.

132
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:13,861
But just, out of curiosity,
'cause it's killin' me,

133
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:15,623
what do you got goin' on down low?

134
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:17,125
Are you flyin' around commando-style,

135
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,263
or do you got, like,

136
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,116
walker long johns with the la... flap?

137
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:24,286
Whoa.

138
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,621
Cool your tits there, Jolly Green Giant.

139
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,457
Noise.

140
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:31,346
Constant noise.

141
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,296
I should just slit your throat,

142
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,114
be done with it.

143
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,392
Okay. You know what?

144
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:41,286
You're right, big man. I am sorry.

145
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:45,048
I never properly introduced myself.

146
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,217
Hey, I'm Negan.

147
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,888
For the last eight years,

148
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,046
I have been locked up by your enemy.

149
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:57,819
So you take me to your leader,

150
00:08:57,822 --> 00:09:02,232
and I will spill every
Goddamn secret I know.

151
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:31,277
Eugene?

152
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,171
I got the supplies ya asked for.

153
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,931
Well, feel free to deposit those

154
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:37,284
in any location of your choosin'.

155
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:44,698
Gotta say, your assist
on the radio relaunch

156
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,609
has been a boon, and
I thank you mightily.

157
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:50,038
Well, I'm happy to be a
part of the Hilltop AV club.

158
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,707
Care to take the new setup for a spin?

159
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,784
Some primo choice upgrades.

160
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:57,379
Transmitter's been properly souped up

161
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,198
with Soviet satellite guts, and...

162
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,897
You don't parlez-vous Russian,

163
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,052
by any chance?

164
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:05,370
Nyet.

165
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,980
Well, that's all I got.

166
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,582
Hmm. Solid.

167
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,225
Well, just checkin'.

168
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,878
Relocatin' the antenna to the apex

169
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,823
provides unobstructed L-O-S
to the secondary repeater,

170
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,216
exponentially expanding our range.

171
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,809
You haven't lived

172
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:22,721
till you've bounced a
transmission off the ionosphere.

173
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,240
Gives me gooseflesh each and every time.

174
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:27,742
Well, this sounds really cool, Eugene,

175
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:30,320
but I gotta get back to the kids.

176
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:32,279
Oh, yeah. Understandable.

177
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:34,249
Bambinos, they take precedent.

178
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,510
No expiration on that invite, though.

179
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,512
Cool. Thanks.

180
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,515
Have fun.

181
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:53,007
Solo trip it is.

182
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,921
Let's see how far you
can fly, little lady.

183
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,538
Calling for Hilltop.

184
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,206
Come in, Hilltop.

185
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:11,103
Hilltop. Calling Hilltop.

186
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,288
Copy that, Alexandria.

187
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,789
This is Hilltop.

188
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,458
Eugene?

189
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,551
Um, yes.

190
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,766
Were you lookin' for
someone in particular?

191
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,250
No, dumbass.

192
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:23,702
I'm looking for you.

193
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:25,208
Oh.

194
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,969
Okeydokey.

195
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:31,730
Just wanted to see what you were up to.

196
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,233
I figured I'd call.

197
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,894
But I'm also running a 102-degree fever,

198
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,905
so I could just be delirious.

199
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:40,607
What sort of ailments
are we wrestlin' with?

200
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,548
Just a bug. I'll be fine.

201
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:44,044
And Coco's okay.

202
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:46,321
What about you? What are you up to?

203
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,067
Oh, just some garden-variety
engineerin' advice,

204
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,523
structural stability checks,

205
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:55,980
a total revamp of their radio setup.

206
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,483
Um, everyone wants a slice of Eugene.

207
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:06,700
Are you coming back anytime soon?

208
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,084
To be honest,

209
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,086
I haven't given much
thought to a timetable,

210
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:14,608
but it is mighty good
to hear your voice.

211
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,592
You, too.

212
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,856
Hold on.

213
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:24,025
We got a malfunction.

214
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:25,527
Mother of pearl.

215
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,643
Everything okay?

216
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,479
Bad solder.

217
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,107
It was a gaffe on my part.

218
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,626
I'm gonna have to fix this pronto

219
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,295
before the whole thing goes FUBAR.

220
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,330
I should get back into bed anyway.

221
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,488
Do you want me to call
you this afternoon?

222
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,272
Are radio waves sinusoidal?

223
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,471
Um, yes?

224
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:48,475
Yes. Yes, they are.

225
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,645
Ugh.

226
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,272
So close.

227
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,485
Ew.

228
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,896
Ugh.

229
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:05,141
Mr. Crossbow, I thought
aiming was your thing.

230
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:09,746
It's definitely not your thing.

231
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,541
Mnh-mnh. Sorry, it doesn't count.

232
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,835
'Course that counts.

233
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,286
No, you gotta knock the can over.

234
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,321
- You can't just kiss it.
- Oh, my God.

235
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:20,257
You're such a sore loser.

236
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,917
I'd have to lose in
order to be a sore loser,

237
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,327
so since that didn't count,

238
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:25,904
I'm gonna take my turn.

239
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:30,845
Oh, it's a double-capper.

240
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:33,366
They're good luck.

241
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,747
Maybe it'll help your aim.

242
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,082
Very funny.

243
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,416
But I'll keep it.

244
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,343
You should watch your
own throws, though.

245
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:42,946
Boom.

246
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,925
How was Hilltop?

247
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,407
It was fine.

248
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,667
King sends his best.

249
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,022
Connie fine, too?

250
00:13:57,394 --> 00:13:59,045
What?

251
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,981
I see things.

252
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:03,366
It's not like that.

253
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:04,776
No?

254
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,721
Not at all.

255
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:11,374
Why not?

256
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:15,970
Aren't that many people left
to find out there these days,

257
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:18,973
much less good ones like her.

258
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,400
Yeah, I know.

259
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,627
Well, then why not?

260
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,629
What's it matter?

261
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,389
'Cause it does.

262
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,891
You don't have to be alone.

263
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:32,079
Years pass, Daryl.

264
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,730
You can't hide out
with your dog forever.

265
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,147
Oh, see?

266
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,317
Your aim's better already.

267
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,609
I'm hungry. You got food?

268
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,413
Yeah, I'll get it.

269
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,112
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:13,027
Mmm.

271
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:15,622
Hey, you see that?

272
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:33,047
It's a Whisperer.

273
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:49,971
He cannot be trusted.

274
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:52,050
Dispose of him.

275
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:59,908
Test him.

276
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,672
If he is worthy, I will hear him.

277
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:09,401
If not, then I kill him.

278
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:12,745
You have other thoughts?

279
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:16,741
It is a mistake showing him our ways.

280
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,579
Your questionin' of my judgment

281
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,915
has become a regular occurrence.

282
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,359
He is a threat.

283
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,606
To Alpha or to Beta?

284
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,853
I think only of our people.

285
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,954
Is it finally time

286
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:49,216
for the Beta to become the Alpha?

287
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,732
Never.

288
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,743
How long you and the
boss lady been together?

289
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,746
Is this, like, a
Beta-with-benefits situation?

290
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,823
Do you slide her a
little omega on the side?

291
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,917
You'll respect the Alpha,

292
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,402
or I end you where you stand.

293
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:28,532
I didn't mean to offend you.

294
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:31,053
I mean, hell, you keep
things professional.

295
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,408
I respect that.

296
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,077
Think I was just thrown off
by the whole kneelin' thing.

297
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,972
Not that there's anything wrong

298
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,932
with the whole kneelin' thing.

299
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,658
I mean, that has tickled the dicks

300
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,274
of many a fine man over the years.

301
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:46,756
Me, myself, I used to
have people kneelin' for me

302
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,257
all the livelong day,

303
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:49,776
so I do understand the benefits

304
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,020
that sort of shit provides.

305
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:55,156
Just actually never
done the deed myself.

306
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:59,440
And I admire your self-restraint,

307
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:01,943
and I'm sayin' this
totally respectfully,

308
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,682
but there is somethin' about
that whole bald-head thing

309
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,442
that just

310
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,461
tightens my britches.

311
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:12,448
Rosita? Gabriel?

312
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,896
Just wanted to swing by to grab
a change of clothes for Coco.

313
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:19,472
Hey, you.

314
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,561
I think I need a house call, Doc.

315
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:22,680
Hm.

316
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:25,385
I thought we were supposed to be in bed.

317
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:28,130
I was, and then I was feeling better,

318
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,465
so I came downstairs.

319
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,133
And then I was feeling even worse,

320
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,710
so now I'm stuck.

321
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,547
Well, you shoulda called
Gabe to come get me.

322
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,474
Ah, the Good Shepherd is out on patrol.

323
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:39,884
Overnighter.

324
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,080
Okay.

325
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,084
Well, field trip to the infirmary.

326
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:47,241
No, come on, Siddiq.
I have so much to do.

327
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,861
I know, like going to the infirmary.

328
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:51,008
No, no, no, no.

329
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:53,362
If you just help me
get to the garage so...

330
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,159
Shit.

331
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:58,736
No. Okay.

332
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,089
Look, it's a crazy idea,

333
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:05,076
but how about we all
go to the infirmary?

334
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,745
Mm? Yeah? Coco says yeah.

335
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,338
Let's go.

336
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,417
Easy.

337
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,280
This is Hilltop callin'
over to Alexandria.

338
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:28,766
Do you copy?

339
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,549
Alexandria, let us know
if you are receivin'.

340
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,555
Alexandria proper, please respond.

341
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,146
Greetings.

342
00:19:58,148 --> 00:20:00,907
This is Tater Bug, callin'
live over open channels.

343
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,225
Anyone out there, give us a copy.

344
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,403
It's getting bigger.

345
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:17,649
Yeah, looks like they're
gatherin' up all the strays.

346
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,575
Well, once the sun goes down,

347
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:21,335
it's gonna be tough to see where they go

348
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,337
unless we can get closer.

349
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:26,491
What makes you think
they're goin' anywhere?

350
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,561
If you and me were Whisperers,

351
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,586
that's when we'd move 'em.

352
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:33,189
You know I'm right.

353
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,092
You wanna cross the border, don't ya?

354
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:39,687
I wanna find the horde.
If that's what it takes...

355
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:42,598
Sure this isn't you just

356
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,117
tryin' to take another shot at Alpha?

357
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,177
The horde is our shot.

358
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,121
You changin' your mind?

359
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:51,365
Nope. I didn't say that.

360
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:54,852
Then what's the problem?

361
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:59,707
Alright, we do this, we
gotta be smart about it.

362
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,376
None of this "runnin' off
in the middle of the night,

363
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:04,862
no backup, just us" stuff, alright?

364
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,625
Since when are we not enough?

365
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:13,871
You know, we mess this up,

366
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,650
everyone else is gonna
pay for it, right?

367
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,892
We've already paid.

368
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:21,210
We keep paying

369
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,065
no matter what side
of the line we're on.

370
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,727
I gotta pee.

371
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,182
Did you find what you were lookin' for?

372
00:22:10,152 --> 00:22:12,762
You bring the gun?

373
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,672
No.

374
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:17,060
Used up all the ammunition, remember?

375
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:20,046
There was still some ammo
left in the storage room.

376
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:24,108
I didn't bring the gun, Daryl.

377
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:26,359
Wanna frisk me?

378
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:28,105
Go ahead.

379
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:30,631
Okay.

380
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:38,973
Either we're enough, or we're not.

381
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,538
Alright, let's do it.

382
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,390
A plan this stupid, might as well be us.

383
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:11,656
So, do I get bathed

384
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:14,767
and reborn in her Whisper-y image,

385
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,663
or is this more like a ball-trippin',

386
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,399
skin-themed vision quest?

387
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:24,337
Dig.

388
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,672
That's it?

389
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,191
I can do that.

390
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,200
Anything in particular
we're goin' for here?

391
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:40,793
Size, depth, width?

392
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,612
Just dig.

393
00:23:46,194 --> 00:23:49,784
Alright.

394
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:07,880
Deeper?

395
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:12,610
Sure. Why not?

396
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,356
Watch your step.

397
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,842
Here we go.

398
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,952
Yeah. Okay.

399
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,363
Looks like I'm not the only one.

400
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:23,956
Yeah.

401
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,276
Let's get you a seat.

402
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:29,189
Dante?

403
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,205
Go ahead and grab a seat wherever.

404
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:34,375
I'll be with you in a sec.

405
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:37,728
Dante, what the hell is goin' on?

406
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:38,911
Hey, guys.

407
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:41,211
I-I-I think the illness is spreading

408
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:42,338
faster than we thought.

409
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:43,671
I-I didn't want to bother you.

410
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:46,219
That is not a decision you get to make.

411
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:48,964
Damn it, man, this is why
I said I shouldn't leave.

412
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:50,632
- Hey, Siddiq, he's...
- What?

413
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:52,610
He's tryin' to help.

414
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:57,381
Start crushing herbs...

415
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,899
ginger and mint for the nausea

416
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:01,677
and oil of oregano and
yarrow for the fever.

417
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,464
This is only gonna get worse
if we're not ahead of it.

418
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:09,410
You good with these rules?

419
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:11,896
Yeah. Don't be seen.

420
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:14,905
No tracks, no killin' walkers neither.

421
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:16,900
Find a bunch of bodies
with holes in their heads,

422
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:19,420
we might as well leave a
note saying we were here.

423
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:23,908
Watch, learn, leave.

424
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,668
Yeah, if things go
sideways, we head back.

425
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,171
We get split up,

426
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:30,915
you meet me right here, alright?

427
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,249
Yeah.

428
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,848
And be safe.

429
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:38,364
We got luck on our side, alright?

430
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,925
Come on.

431
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,444
My porky here,

432
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:46,238
he was a bastard to take down.

433
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:48,651
But I gotta say, this is
exactly the kind of badass shit

434
00:27:48,654 --> 00:27:50,042
I will do for my new family.

435
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,936
Only those who have earned

436
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,881
the right to walk among us may eat.

437
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,958
Earned?

438
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,904
Big man,

439
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:03,986
I helped kill and cook the damn pig.

440
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:05,892
Come on, man, alright?

441
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,226
At the very least,

442
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:10,137
I deserve a piece of bacon.

443
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:32,901
Whatever you say, boss.

444
00:28:57,928 --> 00:29:00,354
This is Tater Bug over open air,

445
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:03,115
surfin' on these proverbial radio waves.

446
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,767
Any interested earholes, come on back.

447
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:14,646
Anyone anywhere?

448
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:17,755
This is Tater Bug.

449
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,788
Hello?

450
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,790
Hello, Tater Bug?

451
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:32,340
I receive you loud and clear.

452
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:34,555
I-I can't believe this.

453
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:38,042
Are you... Are you really out there?

454
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:44,775
Not here.

455
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:51,891
Keep looking.

456
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,476
Well, had I considered the
prospect of first contact,

457
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:04,236
I would've prepared proper remarks

458
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,908
toward the establishin' of relations.

459
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,151
Over.

460
00:31:07,154 --> 00:31:09,229
I don't quite know what to say, either.

461
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:10,647
I'd gotten to the point

462
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,727
where I figured this
was a waste of time.

463
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:14,972
Over.

464
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:18,084
Well, perhaps an exchange of
Q&As might grease the wheels.

465
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,977
A few right off the top of my dome...

466
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,571
where are you located, how
long have you been there,

467
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:24,090
how many people do you have,

468
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,592
and should we continue saying "over"?

469
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,243
Over.

470
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:31,263
We can probably make
do without the "overs."

471
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,748
As for the other stuff,

472
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,344
I don't think I'm comfortable
sharing that just yet.

473
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:39,271
Understandable.

474
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,516
Any alts more within
your zone of comfort?

475
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:46,238
Maybe talk about our
lives before all this?

476
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:49,598
My personal origin entails
a long and storied history.

477
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,008
Were you thinkin' prologue,

478
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,934
or should I skip ahead a few chapters?

479
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:55,770
I guess, uh, start
with where you're from.

480
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:57,123
Certainly.

481
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,016
A Lone Star child at heart,

482
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:01,185
I was born in the shadows of Big D.

483
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:03,871
That's a well-worn
nickname for Dallas, Texas.

484
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:06,189
Yeah, I picked up on that.

485
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:08,025
I grew up in Pennsylvania,

486
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:09,782
a small town called Strasburg.

487
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:11,889
Uh, dubious as it may seem,

488
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:14,306
I know Strasburg, Pennsylvania, well.

489
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:17,446
- Sure you do.
- True as Coventry blue.

490
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:18,517
Durin' adolescence,

491
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,795
I went through a
significant foamer phase.

492
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:22,842
Locomotives were my jam.

493
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:24,558
As such, my parents purchased

494
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,153
a pair of tickets to
the 1995 Trainfan Expo

495
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:30,138
at the Railroad Museum
in, well, you guessed it.

496
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,174
Strasburg, Pennsylvania.

497
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,492
Whoa.

498
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,811
I have the most vivid
memory of an ice-cream shop

499
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:40,666
with the most marvelous batch
of black raspberry ice cream.

500
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,001
The Inside Scoop.

501
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,818
Went there all the time.

502
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,256
Hell, you and I might've
been there on the same day.

503
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,250
Well, knowin' this,

504
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:52,419
there's a critical
question needs answerin'.

505
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:53,679
What's that?

506
00:32:54,998 --> 00:32:56,655
Cake cone or waffle?

507
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:19,045
Been decades since I
got this much attention

508
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:20,915
from younger men.

509
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:22,676
Well, you're my patient,

510
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:26,680
so it's kinda my job
to keep an eye on you.

511
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:29,693
Then what's with the
look of gloom and doom?

512
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:33,445
I feel like I'm nappin'
next to the grim reaper.

513
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:38,266
Sorry.

514
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:40,452
Sorry.

515
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:45,124
I'm just, um, a little concerned.

516
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:50,860
Oh, hon, in this world,
most don't get the luxury

517
00:34:50,863 --> 00:34:54,300
of driftin' off in a nice, comfy bed.

518
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:57,619
I should be so lucky.

519
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:05,352
Get some rest.

520
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,464
Hey, hey, I'll get it for you.

521
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:10,891
Oh, thanks, man.

522
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:16,739
About what I said earlier, I, um...

523
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,641
No worries.

524
00:35:19,643 --> 00:35:21,218
I get it.

525
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,330
We're stuck with
pre-industrial-age meds,

526
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:28,334
and simple shit can
suddenly become a big deal.

527
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,277
We'll figure it out.

528
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,505
Thanks, Dante.

529
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:36,592
I-I appreciate your help.

530
00:35:39,726 --> 00:35:42,485
You should.

531
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,908
I'm kind of amazing.

532
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:49,763
Get some rest, boss.

533
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:52,358
Alright, come on.

534
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,530
Mm.

535
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:07,206
Hey, Coco.

536
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,895
Hey.

537
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:10,898
It's okay.

538
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:13,290
It's okay. Shh.

539
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:15,187
Aww, it's okay.

540
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,615
Uh, Daddy gotcha.

541
00:36:16,618 --> 00:36:18,650
Oh, it's alright.

542
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:21,278
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

543
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,554
Hey.

544
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,698
No, no, no, no.

545
00:36:24,701 --> 00:36:26,943
Oh, it's okay.

546
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:33,565
There you go.

547
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:14,331
Open your eyes.

548
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:20,854
Open your eyes.

549
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:26,100
Open your eyes.

550
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:00,341
Clearly, we are not jivin'.

551
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,379
And, you know, to be honest with you,

552
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,080
I totally understand
the position you're in.

553
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,306
You gotta be, like,

554
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,141
the tough guy and
keep everybody in line.

555
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:08,626
I mean, hell, you know, I had

556
00:38:08,629 --> 00:38:12,331
guys just like you
to keep my shit tight.

557
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,149
Alright, maybe not just like you.

558
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:17,768
Uh, hell, if I had
some monster your size,

559
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:19,671
things would've turned out different.

560
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,990
Look, whether you like me or not,

561
00:38:21,992 --> 00:38:23,917
I will be joinin' this team,

562
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:26,586
so maybe we should find a
way to get along, you know,

563
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:28,663
and stop pissin' on each other's boots.

564
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:32,518
You will never be one of us.

565
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,687
You're too loud,

566
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:41,585
too weak, too full of ego.

567
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:43,695
I mean, it ain't ego

568
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,922
if I really am that awesome.

569
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:49,426
You are a waste,

570
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:52,989
and Alpha will see it.

571
00:38:52,992 --> 00:38:55,949
So cards on the table, then?

572
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:58,101
Cool. I dig that.

573
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,787
See, I'm not here for you.

574
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:02,789
I am here for Alpha.

575
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:04,049
So you go ahead,

576
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,109
and you throw your little tests at me

577
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,409
and you scowl

578
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:10,721
and throw me on the ground like
a five-and-dime Frankenstein.

579
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,559
I don't give a shit.

580
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:16,210
See, big man,

581
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:18,730
I ain't goin' anywhere.

582
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,734
Finally,

583
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,738
something we can both agree on.

584
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,558
You won't be going anywhere.

585
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,748
Wait a minute.

586
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,419
Did you just make a Goddamn joke?

587
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,588
I would be impressed

588
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,240
if I wasn't so pissed off right now.

589
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,913
You have got to be shittin' me.

590
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,120
What the hell is this?

591
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,455
He saw me.

592
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:19,301
We can take him back, see what he knows.

593
00:40:19,304 --> 00:40:20,620
Maybe it's a good thing.

594
00:40:20,623 --> 00:40:23,520
Did you plan this?

595
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,372
No.

596
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:30,861
What's this?

597
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:35,031
It wasn't in your bag.

598
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,125
Guess you missed it.

599
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,536
Come on. We don't have time to argue.

600
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,054
It's done.

601
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:54,142
Roller rinks never made much
dollars-and-centavos sense

602
00:40:54,144 --> 00:40:56,686
to me, purely on a risk/reward analysis.

603
00:40:56,689 --> 00:40:59,406
Too afraid of falling?

604
00:41:00,517 --> 00:41:02,559
Injury combined with humiliation.

605
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,504
Not my favorite pastime.

606
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:14,471
This deet exchange on our formatives

607
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:18,684
has been very enjoyable, and...

608
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:22,579
at the risk of said humiliation,

609
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:26,191
I wonder if we could dip
our toes into some real talk.

610
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:32,180
I...

611
00:41:32,182 --> 00:41:36,702
It's been great, honestly.

612
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:39,779
But I don't really know you.

613
00:41:39,781 --> 00:41:41,546
You might be a threat.

614
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:44,991
Maybe it's better

615
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:50,122
if we let this be, you know, what it is.

616
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:58,965
What if I were to share specifics?

617
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:02,969
Who's to say I'm not a threat to you?

618
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:07,457
People are dangerous.

619
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:10,460
I'm well aware.

620
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:14,222
And yet, I have a twinge in my belly

621
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:16,224
that says you lean toward

622
00:42:16,226 --> 00:42:19,227
the "good" column of
the alignment chart.

623
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:21,562
I do know you.

624
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:29,479
My given name is Eugene Hermann Porter,

625
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,999
and I propose we continue
these convos on the reg,

626
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:35,427
with the hopes of buildin' more.

627
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,004
Should that meet with your approval

628
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:41,266
and/or interest, of course.

629
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:02,512
Hello, Eugene Hermann Porter.

630
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:05,015
I'd like that.

631
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:08,368
I'd like that very much indeed.

632
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:13,004
So we're in agreement, then.

633
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,525
We are.

634
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:22,290
But... But let's just keep
this between us for now.

635
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:25,077
I wanna trust you,

636
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,872
but if I hear anyone
else, I'll know I can't.

637
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:32,892
And you'll never hear from me again.

638
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:39,215
Okay, just you and me.

639
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,826
Copy that.

640
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:43,403
Over.

641
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:05,333
He was weak.

642
00:44:07,337 --> 00:44:08,836
I expected more.

643
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:11,189
He will serve us better
as one of the dead.

644
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,933
I'm ready for my Goddamn skin suit.

645
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:17,712
You best bring that
extra-long tape measure

646
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:22,350
on account of my humongous balls.

647
00:44:25,356 --> 00:44:29,214
Hi. I'm Negan.

648
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:31,689
We haven't formally met,

649
00:44:31,692 --> 00:44:34,953
but I sure as hell know who you are.

650
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:42,779
And whether my reputation
precedes me or not...

651
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:51,788
...I'm all in.

652
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:56,142
Whatever you want, whatever I got,

653
00:44:56,144 --> 00:44:58,552
it's yours.

654
00:45:21,474 --> 00:45:24,095
Shh.

655
