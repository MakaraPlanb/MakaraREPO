1
00:00:00,899 --> 00:00:02,324
There's people in there.

2
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:04,600
Previously on "The Walking Dead"...

3
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:06,004
I lost my Kingdom.

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,048
And Carol.

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,022
I don't even know how
to talk to her anymore.

6
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:11,542
_

7
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,613
This is my home.

8
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,286
Negan killed her!

9
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:21,562
You know, the people out there

10
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:22,990
are talkin' about puttin' you down,

11
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:24,061
It was an accident.

12
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,883
What?

13
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:29,384
He's gone.

15
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:28,931
Gotcha.

16
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,540
Don't try anything.

17
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,495
Man.

18
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,997
The look on your face.

19
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:55,394
Dude, seriously, I'm...
I'm just messin' with you.

20
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:05,087
You're fast.

21
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,573
Took me forever to catch up.

22
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,271
Over there.

23
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,101
Normally, my chief concern

24
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,694
would be the hidden beauty of the grain,

25
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:39,696
but with quantity being of the essence,

26
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:41,456
rift and quarter sawing it'll be.

27
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,883
Happy to recapitulate.

28
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,349
Oh, no, no, just
checking in. Y'all good?

29
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:48,687
Eugene's come up with a zero-waste plan.

30
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,225
Claims he can use every cubic
inch of the tree, even the bark.

31
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,634
Seems as good a time as any

32
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,458
to master the Pueblo
art of basket weaving.

33
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:59,382
Hey, uh, before you head off,

34
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,976
Earl and I were talking.

35
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:03,128
Instead of using the extra
wood for the addition,

36
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,387
what if we made some weapons?

37
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,240
You know, big ones, defensive,

38
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,983
couple... couple of
catapults for the north wall.

39
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:10,068
Yeah, no, look, I think
it's a good idea, honestly,

40
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,261
just not right now,

41
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:13,061
not with half the
Kingdom still in tents.

42
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:14,807
Okay. I get it.

43
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:19,736
So, the Whisperers smash
a giant hole in our wall...

44
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:21,146
Yeah, well, we don't
know it was them for sure.

45
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,815
...and now they're
throwin' walkers at us

46
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,741
every couple hours, and
we're just gonna sit here,

47
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:27,502
twiddlin' our damn thumbs?

48
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,154
It happened again.

49
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,331
Root cellar. Middle of the night.

50
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,418

the one from Oceanside.

No sign of Negan?

78
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:15,690
Searched all day and
night, but no sign of him.

79
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,596
Keep thinkin' about
what he took from us,

80

what we didn't take from him.

81
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:23,831

Hey, you've had your trouble, too.

83
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,615
Actually, we could use
a hand in the infirmary.

84
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:30,241
Much of the Kingdom's still in recovery

85
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,552
from the tree fall.

86
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,628

87
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,039
but, uh... but yeah.

88
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,684
Of course. Whatever you need.

89
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,880
You ask about Carol?

90
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,948
Open the gate!

91
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:50,479
Nah.

00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:11,932
_

93
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,927
She's not here?

94
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,222
She was tracking something,

95
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,174
said she'd meet us back here.

96
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:20,934
Should've been back by now.

97
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,933
Was that it?

98
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:39,552
Did I get it?

99
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:42,860
Nah. You woulda totally
whistled back, right?

100
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:44,533
My dad, he used to tell me how, like,

101
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:45,942
you and the Saviors would, like,

102
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:48,627
whistle back and forth
like that before...

103
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,587
You, uh... you say you had
some granola or some shit?

104
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,119
Sorry about the raisins
and the busted knife.

105
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,455
Was kinda in a rush
when I packed it all.

106
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,369
So, you're really not gonna tell me

107
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,480
how you got outta that cell?

108
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:11,134
Alright, well, at least tell
me what we're lookin' for.

109
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,136
Someplace safe.

110
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:16,156
I get it. A new Sanctuary.

111
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,733
Damn, how badass was that place?

112
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:21,386
And then Rick Grimes comes along,

113
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:25,315
talk about hypocrisy, kills our parents,

114
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:28,151
drags us to Alexandria,

115
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:30,634
lectures us about community.

116
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:33,636
Eh. Can't argue that. It ain't bullshit.

117
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,159
Man, I heard you made him
cut his own kid's hand off,

118
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,570
then you killed them.

119
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,906
Carl Grimes... I heard you shot him.

120
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:44,518
I never did that.

121
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,172
And I never did that to Carl.

122
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:52,675
Carl was...

123
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:58,031
I would never kill a kid.

124
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,446
Yeah, no, definitely.

125
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:07,109
I'm with you, obviously.

126
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:09,359
We're both Negan.

127
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,136
Who would do this?

128
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:29,802
The skin freaks.

129
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:30,956
Damn.

130
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,959
Should we cross?

131
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,553
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend"?

132
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:40,056
No.

133
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:26,695
Thanks for your help.

134
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:30,515
Sorry. I just needed a
second to wrap your gift.

135
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,944
There's more.

136
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:37,130
I swiped it all from Alexandria.

137
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,949
Was waiting for the right
time to surprise you.

138
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:49,125
Took me forever to find this.

139
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:52,145
Found it in the back of
an old storage garage.

140
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,707
My dad said he never saw you without it.

141
00:12:57,211 --> 00:13:00,136
Listen, uh...

142
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:02,897
why don't you just put
that in your backpack?

143
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,383
I don't wanna be recognized.

144
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,643
You like it, though, right?

145
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:11,647
Does pig shit stink?

146
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:38,734
I'm gonna say...

147
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:40,504
she's a seven.

148
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:44,456
What?

149
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:45,808
Isn't this the kind of stuff

150
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:48,076
you and the Saviors
used to do to kill time?

151
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,582
I can't say that I remember
rating walkers on hotness.

152
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:54,784
Besides, she's clearly a three.

153
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:56,919
Spot's not half bad, right?

154
00:14:56,921 --> 00:15:00,256
New Sanctuary.

155
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:23,296
You gotta be kidding me.

156
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,500
Damn! Classic Negan.

157
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,446
It's not your fault.

158
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:22,966
_

159
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,699
Hey.

160
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,760
Did I ever tell you
about my brother, Merle?

161
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,035
Uh...

162
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:43,268
Merle.

163
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,081
Okay, this one time,
he takes me fishing.

164
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,239
Right?

165
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:53,294
Fishing, right, on this big lake, right,

166
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:55,463
which is, uh...

167
00:16:55,465 --> 00:16:57,873
private property...

168
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,215
right?

169
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:04,806
In this boat, which is, uh, stolen.

170
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:07,049
Stolen boat, right?

171
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:09,301
And he's drinking, right?

172
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:12,054
So he's fishing, he's drinking.

173
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:13,889
He falls in the lake.

174
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:15,858
Like, ka-pssh!

175
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,045
Right?

176
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:22,414
I have to take him, uh, like this...

177
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:25,827
...swim him all the way back.

178
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,645
I save his life, right?

179
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,698
You know what he says to me?

180
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:38,247
"Dummy, go get the beer."

181
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:43,590
Idiot, right?

182
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:45,013
Yeah.

183
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,093
It's gonna be alright.

184
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,187
Come on.

185
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,450
Good dog. Good dog.

186
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:02,104
What?

187
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:40,568
So, uh, the roofing and
the gutters should be fine,

188
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,054
but the plumbing's
making me kinda nervous.

189
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,907
I have to scavenge for more copper.

190
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,317
I should really be out there with them.

191
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,491
You know, if I was lost in the woods,

192
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:58,636
it's the three of them I'd
want to come looking for me.

193
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:04,075
Somebody's gotta hang back,
deal with the plumbing.

194
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,813
I'll... I'll ask Oscar about the copper.

195
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,360
You really think Kelly's okay?

196
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,678
I hope so.

197
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,307
What about us?

198
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,328
That tree didn't fall on its own.

199
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:24,445
Wasn't leaning or dying.
The roots were healthy.

200
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:27,207
If you don't think they're
coming back for worse, son,

201
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,042
you're not thinking at all.

202
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:35,105
I haven't forgotten
about them, you know?

203
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,774
Think about 'em every day.

204
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,218
Well, good. Don't stop.

205
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,559
We've had some thefts lately.

206
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,454
Took a quarter of our medical supplies.

207
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:55,007
Sorry. I...

208
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,552
No, no. It's, uh...

209
00:19:56,554 --> 00:20:00,222
Henry forged it during
his apprenticeship.

210
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:03,309
Found it wrapped among his things.

211
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:06,413
A gift intended for me but never...

212
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:10,658
You okay?

213
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:12,568
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

214
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:16,831
Uh-huh.

215
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,999
That doesn't sound good.

216
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,760
It's nothing.

217
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,757
Just the regular slings and arrows.

218
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,265
Or smoke inhalation from the
fire might've triggered it.

219
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,433
Let me just...

220
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,159
I said I was fine.

221
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,436
Okay.

222
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,456
How long have you...

223
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,793
A month.

224
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:56,537
It's grown since then.

225
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,525
Look.

226
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:03,452
It could be a lot of
things, yeah? Infection.

227
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:05,713
- You know you might've injured yourself.
- I know what it is.

228
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,198
Listen, without tests,
you can't be sure.

229
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,600
Siddiq, I know what it is.

230
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,841
Growing up, my grandmother
went through it,

231
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:27,141
then my father.

232
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:30,363
The pain, the coughing, the swelling.

233
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:33,741
I watched them fight it and win.

234
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:37,562
Did you know thyroid cancer
had a 98% survival rate?

235
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,656
Different times.

236
00:21:40,658 --> 00:21:44,085
Times of sorcery and witchcraft.

237
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:47,830
Chemo, iodine radiation therapy,

238
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:51,092
thyroidectomies.

239
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:52,410
Now?

240
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:56,633
Now we both know what it means.

241
00:21:56,636 --> 00:22:00,009
No, you can manage it.

242
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:01,919
Acupuncture, uh, hypnosis.

243
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:03,846
There's... You...

244
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:10,928
You know, I've been struggling
with my own condition...

245
00:22:12,356 --> 00:22:14,432
...ever since the barn.

246
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,271
That's why I had to leave Alexandria.

247
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:22,623
I just... I can't stand

248
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,276
how everyone looks to
me for some kinda...

249
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:32,708
So, you know, maybe we
can't get away from it.

250
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,969
But we can talk about it.

251
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:38,047
I mean, what are we here for

252
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:39,791
if not for each other?

253
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:44,219
It was just Milo and me.

254
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:49,409
We'd been walking for days, weeks,

255
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,469
until the hissers ran through our camp,

256
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,209
scattered everyone to the winds.

257
00:22:53,212 --> 00:22:58,826
After that, we went back
to what it was before,

258
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:01,454
what it always is in the end...

259
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:03,906
Milo and me,

260
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:08,243
moving from place to place, surviving.

261
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:10,321
I get it.

262
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:11,914
I've been there.

263
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,466
I better stay on my feet.

264
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:15,676
Milo, you wanna come on a walk?

265
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:16,936
Yeah.

266
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:23,151
Be safe.

267
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,361
So, what are you thinkin'?

268
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:36,080
We follow 'em, see
where they're hiding it?

269
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:39,626
Hiding what?

270
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,276
They've got a stash somewhere,

271
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,207
probably full of weapons, too.

272
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,950
It's a chick and a kid, Brandon.

273
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:49,952
People are a resource.

274
00:23:49,954 --> 00:23:52,472
Yeah. Not them.

275
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:00,938
Alright, look.

276
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,593
I appreciate everything
you've done since Alexandria,

277
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:11,398
but it's only gonna get
more dangerous from here.

278
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:13,976
I think it's best I go on alone

279
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:15,995
and you go home.

280
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:20,396
Okay.

281
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:26,747
It's just, if I go back,

282
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:30,234
everyone's gonna wanna
know where I've been.

283
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,345
What am I supposed to say?

284
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,906
I've never been a great liar.

285
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,509
New plan, then.

286
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:50,846
You go wherever the hell you want.

287
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,773
You go back to Alexandria,

288
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:57,780
you tell the whole
world exactly where I am.

289
00:24:57,783 --> 00:25:00,373
You see, I don't give a shit.

290
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,433
Just as long as I don't have to see

291
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:06,454
that pasty, creepy-ass
face of yours ever again.

292
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:15,613
You're just like all the others.

293
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,045
Careful, now.

294
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,289
Ears are the trickiest.

295
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,631
You have something for me?

296
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:55,603
I've been damming up the
creek, like you wanted.

297
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:58,681
I've just come back
for one more guardian.

298
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:02,326
A guardian taken is another lost.

299
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,987
Patience.

300
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,849
Shifts in strategy take time.

301
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:15,523
The creek, the water, the tree...

302
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:17,525
it will crush them.

303
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:21,195
Or we could release
an army of thousands.

304
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:26,517
Go ahead.

305
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,278
Say your piece.

306
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,357
Instead of these little nicks,

307
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,545
getting our guardians
killed at their walls,

308
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:39,697
why don't we...

309
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:43,868
cut the enemy down all at once?

310
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,132
Let us vote.

311
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:53,878
Anyone agree?

312
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:09,151
That's democracy for you.

313
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,109
The human body...

314
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,162
...is fragile.

315
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:23,034
All it takes for it to collapse

316
00:27:23,037 --> 00:27:27,336
is a few nicks in the right spots.

317
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:32,516
Just like the enemy.

318
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,935
When their world collapses,
the smart ones will know

319
00:27:35,938 --> 00:27:38,180
where to come to stay safe.

320
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,759
We'll be waiting.

321
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:03,264
You said you wanted another guardian.

322
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,401
Oh, no! We're gonna crash!

323
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:18,979
Ah.

324
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:20,263
Hey.

325
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:23,892
Don't worry, kid. I don't bite.

326
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:26,153
Your mom, she's inside, packin',

327
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:28,360
so we got a little bit of time to kill.

328
00:28:28,363 --> 00:28:29,921
Where'd Brandon go?

329
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:33,585
Brandon... he went looking for supplies.

330
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,084
You know what?

331
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:37,924
I'm gonna be real with you.

332
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,760
Uh, I told Brandon to get lost.

333
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,929
You see, uh, it turns out,

334
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:46,173
not the best co-pilot,
if you catch my dri...

335
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:48,842
You don't catch my drift at all, do ya?

336
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:51,062
You've never been on a plane.

337
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,271
Aw, man, it's alright.

338
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,663
It's not your fault that
God turned this world

339
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:59,081
into an asspit before you were born.

340
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,690
Alright.

341
00:29:02,692 --> 00:29:05,025
Picture this, alright?

342
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:08,437
Sitting on a plane,
really nice, comfy seats,

343
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:11,276
but it feels like you've
been sitting on the runway

344
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,701
for Goddamn ever.

345
00:29:13,703 --> 00:29:17,354
Suddenly, there's this kinda rumbling,

346
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,818
a groan, alright?

347
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:23,951
The plane finally starts
to creep along, right,

348
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:26,547
and now we're moving faster and faster.

349
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:27,907
And you look out that window,

350
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:30,142
and everything's turning into a blur.

351
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:33,700
And then, "Whew."

352
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:35,630
Wheels come up off the ground.

353
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:37,870
You are flying.

354
00:29:37,873 --> 00:29:41,469
It is like voodoo magic, man, alright?

355
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:44,445
Up and up and up, higher and higher,

356
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:46,066
until it feels like you are floating

357
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,976
on top of the frickin' world.

358
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:51,405
And you're looking out that little
window, and you can see houses.

359
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:55,817
They look like little toy
houses and little toy cars.

360
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:57,077
Oh.

361
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,912
But the food?

362
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:00,673
Unh-unh. No way.

363
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,905
They served us something.
They called it beef stroganoff.

364
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:05,919
Let me tell you something.
It looked like baby shit.

365
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:09,765
And my Lucille she
wouldn't even touch it.

366
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,764
Ah, kid, there is so
much you're gonna miss

367
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:21,101
growing up in this... screwed-up world.

368
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:24,438
You know, driving your
first set of wheels,

369
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
video games,

370
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:27,783
nut-tapping.

371
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:32,687
What, you've never heard of nut-tapping?

372
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:36,433
Seriously? With big ol'
sausage fingers like those?

373
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,713
Alright, man, the whole
point of nut-tapping...

374
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,864
catching the other guy off guard, right,

375
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:44,199
embarrassing him,

376
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:46,741
getting even for him
calling your mom a slut

377
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:47,910
or whatever.

378
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:52,449
Wanna keep your wrist loose, like this.

379
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,452
Lean in all casual like.

380
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,212
And then... thwack!

381
00:30:57,214 --> 00:30:59,957
Snap your fingers right on his nuts.

382
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,716
Now, you gotta remember, you go low.

383
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:04,886
You go too high, you
get nothing but dick.

384
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:06,823
Alright, let's see what you got.

385
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,415
You're a natural.

386
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,303
See, if nut-tapping were a sport,

387
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:13,702
you wouldn't have to 'roid up,

388
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,012
and you would still
be in the hall of fame.

389
00:31:20,101 --> 00:31:21,355
Ahh.

390
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:24,340
Alright, kid, dinner.

391
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,202
Not gonna happen without fire.

392
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:29,336
Fire's not gonna happen without wood.

393
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:31,430
Tell me something.
You get all packed up?

394
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:33,224
Yeah.

395
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:40,588
Hey, you know, I know that moving sucks.

396
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:43,625
You know, it's like I was
telling your mom, though,

397
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:46,670
I know a place that I'm pretty
sure they're gonna take you in.

398
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:51,735
It's got really high walls, farmland,

399
00:31:51,738 --> 00:31:55,011
even has a mansion sitting
in the middle of it.

400
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:57,105
You just can't tell 'em
who brought ya, alright?

401
00:31:57,107 --> 00:31:59,867
But I will get you as close as I can.

402
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:02,611
One condition, though.

403
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:04,855
Keep those meaty fingers holstered up

404
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:06,523
when my nuts are around.

405
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,908
Okay.

406
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,951
- Deal?
- Yeah.

407
00:32:09,953 --> 00:32:11,195
My man.

408
00:32:44,188 --> 00:32:45,491
I anoint you Gamma.

409
00:32:55,227 --> 00:32:57,455
Oh!

410
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:01,298
Shit. Shit!

411
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,252
It's okay.

412
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,606
That's for you.

413
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:14,783
I had it in my bag.

414
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,219
Take it.

415
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:19,330
It's okay.

416
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:24,526
My name is Aaron.

417
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:26,238
What...

418
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:29,179
That's right. You guys
don't do names anymore.

419
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:32,967
But you're from somewhere, right?

420
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,111
I'm from Vermont. Where...

421
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:41,060
You're welcome!

422
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:57,576
Hey.

423
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:01,914
Hey.

424
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:05,333
_

425
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,891
_

426
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,664
_

427
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,529
_

428
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:32,019
We've gotta get her back to Hilltop.

429
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:35,096
Nah, I think we gotta
find somewhere closer.

430
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,035
_

431
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,192
Tell them what?

432
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,592
Did you know about this?

433
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:08,981
Hey. What's she saying?

434
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,442
I said I don't trust you.

435
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,340
What's your problem?

436
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:16,488
Huh?

437
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,182
Hilltop takes you in.

438
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:19,950
They got sick children
and mouths to feed,

439
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,735
and you steal from 'em?

440
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:24,455
All you're good for is talking shit.

441
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,514
_

442
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,673
That's it, right?

443
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:05,830
You almost had me.

444
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,855
Back on the bus, when you kicked me out.

445
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:11,762
Then I remembered, "This is Negan.

446
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:15,842
He's always messing with
people, keeping 'em in line."

447
00:36:15,845 --> 00:36:19,730
So I realized there's a test.

448
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:23,447
"It's gonna get a lot more
dangerous from here on out."

449
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,224
That's what you said to me.

450
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:27,189
You wanted to make sure
that I had the balls

451
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:29,286
to do what had to be done.

452
00:36:30,973 --> 00:36:32,213
What do you think?

453
00:36:36,045 --> 00:36:37,377
I passed, right?

454
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:38,737
I am Neg...

455
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:50,306
_

456
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,148
_

457
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,806
I had to pop a couple blisters.

458
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:06,992
Bill's still freaking
out about that rash.

459
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,828
What else?

460
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,055
I mean, the universe
is basically on pause

461
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:13,314
till God gets back.

462
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:18,539
I'm assuming your mic's out,

463
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,839
or else I'd hear you
laughing your balls off.

464
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:23,342
Nope, still here.

465
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,737
How's Rosita?

466
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,331
She, uh, didn't want me to tell you,

467
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,075
but she caught a little bug.

468
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,534
She okay? Gabe back?

469
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:36,855
Not yet. But she'll be fine.

470
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:43,770
I'll leave for home tonight.

471
00:38:43,772 --> 00:38:45,364
You sure?

472
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:46,815
Yeah, I'm sure.

473
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:49,043
One other thing.

474
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:51,137
Is Carol around?

475
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,187
She's just outside. Let me grab her.

476
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,730
Hey, Carol. Siddiq's
on the radio for ya.

477
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,595
You know, it's scary to think, but...

478
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:53,824
Kelly probably wouldn't have made it

479
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:56,268
if you guys hadn't
have found that stash.

480
00:39:59,602 --> 00:40:02,047
Sounds like it was pretty
far off the main road.

481
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,833
Just say it.

482
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:06,518
You think I stole everything
and hid it out there.

483
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:09,114
Yeah, well, it wouldn't
have been the first time.

484
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:12,600
Then... it would've been smart.

485
00:40:12,602 --> 00:40:14,669
Yeah, or it would've been a mis...

486
00:40:14,671 --> 00:40:16,955
Selfish, stupid.

487
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:18,634
I was gonna say a mistake.

488
00:40:18,637 --> 00:40:21,879
No, but you were thinking it.

489
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:24,630
For 13 years, that's
how you've looked at me.

490
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:25,984
That is not true.

491
00:40:25,987 --> 00:40:29,208
Since the day you showed up

492
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:33,454
in your... your fancy
suit, with all your fancy...

493
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:35,623
Do you really wanna know
what I thought that day?

494
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:38,644
I thought, "Here is a
person, an innocent person

495
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:42,038
who's been locked up for
a crime they didn't commit,

496
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,815
someone who's never trusted anybody

497
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:46,142
because no one's ever trusted her,

498
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,711
someone who's good.

499
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:50,213
And, yeah, mad.

500
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,716
Mad at everyone.

501
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:54,901
Mad at the world for
being so messed up."

502
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:58,330
My cousin, she was a little girl,

503
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,424
and he gets to go on living his life?

504
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:03,710
No way.

505
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:09,299
But nobody came for him.

506
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:14,721
So I came for him.

507
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:21,669
And there it is.

508
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:24,672
Now that we've both killed...

509
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:27,584
how many people have we killed, Miko?

510
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:31,104
And still, that look right there.

511
00:41:31,107 --> 00:41:34,450
I think you should find
another place to sleep.

512
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:56,704
The... man with the
metal arm gave it to me.

513
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:57,864
I don't know what that...

514
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,785
Sit.

515
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,504
We've all had to wear different masks

516
00:42:37,506 --> 00:42:39,172
at different times.

517
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:44,511
Call it a kinda sacrifice.

518
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,272
Like your sister.

519
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:55,907
Your sacrifice was... much greater.

520
00:42:57,342 --> 00:43:00,860
The man with the metal arm...

521
00:43:00,862 --> 00:43:03,104
could prove useful.

522
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:09,352
You might just have to wear a new mask.

523
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,720
_

524
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:31,594
Uh, yeah.

525
00:43:31,597 --> 00:43:34,690
Uh, Siddiq has to go back.

526
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,898
Is, um...

527
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,450
Kelly okay?

528
00:43:41,477 --> 00:43:42,661
Mm.

529
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,431
_

530
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,987
_

531
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,748
No, no, no.

532
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,342
I get it. Um...

533
00:43:59,277 --> 00:44:01,219
Family.

534
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,597
Right?

535
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,854
Alright.

536
00:44:44,374 --> 00:44:47,467
Oh, you sorry, rotten sacks of shit.

537
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:51,379
What's a fella gotta do
to get eaten around here?

538
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:53,565
What's the matter? Huh?

539
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:57,127
Y'all scared of the Big Bad Wolf?

540
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:03,650
Little pig, little pig!

541
00:45:06,508 --> 00:45:07,746
Uh-oh.

542
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:09,247
Let me in.

543
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:11,491
And there you are!

544
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:17,313
Oh, I am gonna huff.

545
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,077
I am gonna puff.

546
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:29,842
