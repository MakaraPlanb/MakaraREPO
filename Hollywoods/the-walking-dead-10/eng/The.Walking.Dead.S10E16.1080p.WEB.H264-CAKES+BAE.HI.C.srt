1
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:10,473
Watch where you're... Sorry.

2
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:11,879
Dammit!

3
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,576
Yeah. Me, too.

4
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,167
I'm scared.

5
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,433
But we're safe up here.

6
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:46,566
You've seen how many are coming.

7
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,655
Lots more than we have.

8
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:51,571
You see these fingers?

9
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:54,878
Not much to look at, right?

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,187
But together, they make a mighty weapon.

11
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:01,581
That's who we are.

12
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,191
Alexandria.

13
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:04,584
Hilltop.

14
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,262
Oceanside.

15
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:08,588
People of the Kingdom.

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,938
Is that enough?

17
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,207
I'm not done yet.

18
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,898
Who's that for?

19
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:19,164
The others.

20
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,647
The ones that aren't here.

21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,606
- Go, go, go!
- Come on!

22
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,878
Those that might find us help.

23
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:46,147
Or come here and help.

24
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:57,245
Together, we will fight.

25
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:08,474
And that's how we will survive.

26
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:21,679
_

27
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:29,451
Together.

28
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:42,976
We are ready.

29
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:46,119
Are you?

30
00:02:57,394 --> 00:03:02,742
We are the end of the world.

31
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:08,489
This is the end of the world.

32
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,319
Begin.

33
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:11,156

34
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:17,286
Okay.

35
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:19,437
Maybe we can bend this back.

36
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,700
Pound that puppy.

37
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:22,434
Hammer. I have one in my bag.

38
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,610
I don't know about this chain, though.

39
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,307
Eugene, we could use some of these

40
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:29,051
problem-solving skills over here.

41
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:33,481
Hey. It's not that bad.

42
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:35,445
We'll be back on the road soon.

43
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,798
Don't bother.

44
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,465
- Come on, mate, we've...
- It's too late.

45
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:43,879
I may have taken a shot to the noggin,

46
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:44,953
but I'm still capable

47
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:46,500
of running calculations and estimates.

48
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:47,850
And the ticks it would take

49
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,113
to execute necessary repairs and vamoose

50
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:52,028
is simply too great a mountain to climb.

51
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,769
We'll figure something out.

52
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:56,555
Unless it involves slowing
the passage of time,

53
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:58,470
there's nothing else to figure.

54
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,929
Our rendezvous was set in stone.

55
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:06,159
And if we're not there,
Stephanie won't be, either.

56
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:12,039
I'm truly sorry.

57
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,921
After all we hoped,

58
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:19,710
after all we went through
to hold on to said hope.

59
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:22,580
I believe it's time

60
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,888
we go eye to eye with reality...

61
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,456
and turn back for home.

62
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,162
We are not going back.

63
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,993
We set out to do this,
and we're gonna do this.

64
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:47,257
In my own moment of
doubt, you did not waver,

65
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,347
and I'm not about to let you do it now.

66
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,698
This journey... your journey...

67
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,265
must be completed.

68
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,443
Not just for you, but for all of us here

69
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,872
and the ones we left behind.

70
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,449
We must try.

71
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,668
That's what's gotten us this far.

72
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,367
On this journey and in this life.

73
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,457
And that's what I want to remember.

74
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,503
That we gave it everything we had.

75
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,543
Even if it means I gotta carry you

76
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,075
over my damn shoulder to do it.

77
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:31,167
Come on.

78
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:42,008
I want that, too.

79
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,749
But it doesn't change

80
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:46,360
that Stephanie will not
stay past sundown tomorrow.

81
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,883
She say that to you?

82
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:49,140
Then you don't know.

83
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,857
I mean, I thought I'd
never see people again,

84
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,802
and, wow, look at me now.

85
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:56,312
- She's right.
- I am.

86
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,766
We keep going, and we get there.

87
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:03,421
Tomorrow's problems are for tomorrow.

88
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,776
Helping some people?

89
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,187
That's all she said?

90
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,218
Yeah.

91
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:19,351
If they're like us, I get it.

92
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,396
I just wish she would've told me.

93
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,835
I'd've gone with her.

94
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:29,359
Only way she would go anywhere

95
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:31,318
is knowing you were here.

96
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,926
For Judith and RJ.

97
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:34,335
Everyone.

98
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:36,671
Just keep thinking I'm
never gonna see her again.

99
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,648
Just like everyone else.

100
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,642
I'm still here.

101
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,904
Our plan is the same.

102
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:54,059
Lead the horde away,

103
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:56,561
just not from Oceanside
as we had planned.

104
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,476
Once the walkers are clear,

105
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,826
we evacuate to Rendezvous Point B.

106
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,568
Luke. We ready?

107
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,023
Yeah, yeah. Uh, technically.

108
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:08,679
Okay.

109
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:11,966
So, these are the final pieces

110
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:15,014
that we need to connect to the wagon.

111
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:18,017
But in order for it to
do the pied piper thing

112
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:19,845
that we need it to do over the cliff,

113
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:23,856
we gotta get from A to B,
and I gotta plug and plug,

114
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,832
and then we should be good to go.

115
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:28,418
That wagon is on the
other side of the horde.

116
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,682
So... someone's gotta go through it?

117
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,215
With skins in there?

118
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:33,423
Four groups.

119
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,390
Two in each.

120
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:36,556
One carries the cargo, one protects.

121
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,472
It's crucial that all the equipment

122
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:39,821
makes it to the wagon.

123
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,867
We can make it through.

124
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:44,826
I'll help.

125
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,916
We're willing.

126
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,984
But not if she goes.

127
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:54,618
And we know she's earned
trust with you, but...

128
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,364
Oceanside isn't ready.

129
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,361
- Not with this.
- That's fine.

130
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:00,363
As it happens, Lydia's role is in here.

131
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,804
Look, we're not all
gonna make it through.

132
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:08,241
But this is the only way.

133
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:11,026
If Daryl's going, then so am I.

134
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,520
Negan helped them attack Hilltop.

135
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:29,153
- That couldn't have happened...
- Dianne, I know.

136
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:31,048
And I'm sorry about that.

137
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:51,670
Need help?

138
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:55,985
I've got it.

139
00:09:57,686 --> 00:10:00,341
Okay.

140
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,995
If you're avoiding me, please stop.

141
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,601
I don't hate you for what you did.

142
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,570
You should.

143
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:20,052
Didn't fix anything.

144
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,619
It did for me.

145
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,144
A little, at least.

146
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:29,931
I know that sounds awful, but...

147
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:33,282
She was never really my mother.

148
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:36,416
Not in the way that matters.

149
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,594
So, thanks.

150
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:46,600
And I-I... I'd like it
if we can still talk.

151
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,167
About...

152
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,777
whatever.

153
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,569
Lydia...

154
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,396
You need to be yourself.

155
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,836
You need to find your own way.

156
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:12,321
I'm not looking for
another mom, you know?

157
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:15,760
That's not what this has to be.

158
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:20,025
It can be something else.

159
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,549
So can you.

160
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:37,739
Got your back for you, dear?

161
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,911
You know I got your back
out there, too, right?

162
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:42,554
Oh. And the rest of me?

163
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:44,516
Yeah, I'm good to get that, too.

164
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:47,439
_

165
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:49,063
_

166
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,229
Hey. You okay?

167
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:54,059
I mean, going back into
the herd after everything...

168
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:56,278
I'm fine. You?

169
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,193
Not at all.

170
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:01,022
Hey.

171
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,154
- Why you clean?
- I ain't going.

172
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:04,852
You've done this more'n any of us.

173
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:07,507
I am on the tip-top of
every skins' kill list.

174
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,997
Especially fee fi fo asshole.

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,641
So if the idea is to get through

176
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:14,166
without drawing a shitload of attention,

177
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,863
then I am the last person

178
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,647
these people want standing next to them.

179
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,562
That's a bunch of bullshit.

180
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,521
You wanna be a part of this?

181
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,828
You gotta put your ass on the line.

182
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,221
Just like everybody else.

183
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:29,442
It's time.

184
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:30,992
There.

185
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:32,588
In the center.

186
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,426
Brown plaid shirt.

187
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,143
Just wound.

188
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:38,343
Got it.

189
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:10,157
Tighten the herd.

190
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:16,060
Together.

191
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,544
Together.

192
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,125
Together.

193
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:27,021
Together.

194
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,362
Together.

195
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:32,136
Right now.

196
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,070
I can't find any of them.

197
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,073
Beta knows they're in there.

198
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,641
What do we do?

199
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,382
Hey, I've got one.

200
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:03,167
Are you sure?

201
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,516
Uh... yeah, I think so.

202
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:05,865
Wait. We need to be certain.

203
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,408
It might be one of our own people...

204
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,724
They're coming up.

205
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,814
You all know what to do.

206
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:44,077
Dianne, you get the first group.

207
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,416
Children and wounded come second.

208
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:50,214
If Rosita argues, just come and find me.

209
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:56,307
You know how this ends.

210
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,830
I don't.

211
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:00,049
Neither do you.

212
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,442
Come on, kid.

213
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,879
You being here when the shitstorm hits

214
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:06,404
ain't changing what
definitely is happening.

215
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:07,709
I'm not leaving.

216
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,929
They're never gonna trust me, you.

217
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:12,584
Doesn't matter what we do now.

218
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,255
You can just slip out, down,

219
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:17,737
and dance your way through the dead.

220
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,634
So can you.

221
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:25,684
Like you said, I ain't no hero.

222
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:28,643
You could be.

223
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:31,332
Well...

224
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:33,893
I guess that's what I'm doing now.

225
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,721
What if we're the only ones?

226
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,174
Where's Carol, where's Beatrice?

227
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,276
Carol! Take it! Take it!

228
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,701
Need to start soon.

229
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:17,312
They're not up yet, but they will be.

230
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:18,510
Yeah, right on it.

231
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:19,918
But Luke's duct taped a bunch of wires

232
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,398
to a tape deck so...

233
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,313
- My prayers are with you.
- Gonna need 'em.

234
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,234
Go get Dog.

235
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:56,215
The end...

236
00:23:56,217 --> 00:24:00,045

Gabriel, we lost the wagon.

284
00:27:19,963 --> 00:27:22,487
You got walkers coming
right back at you.

285
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,860
They should've evacuated by now.

286
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,732
Then they're unprotected.

287
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:31,116
- We need to turn that horde around.
- How?

288
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,241
Look, this ain't a good plan,

289
00:27:34,244 --> 00:27:35,851
but it's all I got.

290
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,865
I say we go back in there,
and we hunt the skins.

291
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,999
We take 'em out, one by one.

292
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:42,523
If we don't do this,

293
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:44,530
- all our people are gonna die.
- Then what?

294
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:46,401
How do we lead them away?

295
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:49,274
I-I will.

296
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,148
No, we'll think of another way.

297
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:54,202
I know how. She taught me.

298
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,846
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

299
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:57,369
Let's say we actually do this,

300
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:58,976
and you lead them to the cliff,

301
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:00,799
there's no wagon to
bring them over the edge.

302
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,635
I mean, it's suicide.

303
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:04,811
It has to be me. I can do it.

304
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:07,530
We're gonna deal with this later.

305
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:10,512
Come on. We gotta go. Right now.

306
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:22,133
You all need to go. Now.

307
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:25,484
You're not coming.

308
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:28,705
Someone needs to stop
them from cutting the rope.

309
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,669
Does Rosita know?

310
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:43,894
Tell her, "Eres mi media naranja."

311
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:45,939
Half orange?

312
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,377
She'll know.

313
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:53,817
Jude. Come on.

314
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,383
Go.

315
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:07,004
The Lord's house is a tower.

316
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:12,052
The righteous enter and are safe.

317
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,893
Aah!

318
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,866
It's okay.

319
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:02,799
He's with me.

320
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,919
Aah!

321
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,798
Alpha.

322
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:01,988
Hey, shithead...

323
00:31:17,997 --> 00:31:20,528
For Alpha.

324
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:32,323
In darkness, we are free.

325
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:34,281
You bathe in blood.

326
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:35,674
You are not broken!

327
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,110
We are free.

328
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:39,765
We love nothing.

329
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,476
We are free.

330
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:44,234
We fear nothing.

331
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:46,304
We are free.

332
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:49,340
We embrace our death.

333
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:52,734
Now is the end of the world.

334
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:56,216
We are the end of the world.

335
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:24,810
Holy shit.

336
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:27,117
You know who that asshole was?

337
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,799
Yeah. Nobody.

338
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:00,812
Go.

339
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,765
My choice.

340
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:11,204
I finish it.

341
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:37,377
I told you to go.

342
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:44,210
You told me to find my own way.

343
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:03,621
Thank you.

344
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,385
Hi.

345
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,769
Is it...?

346
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:33,945
It is.

347
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,990
Thanks to her.

348
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:37,702
And her.

349
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:41,344
Thanks all around, people.

350
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,911
I can't believe we pulled it off.

351
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:49,134
You're still here.

352
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:51,571
For now.

353
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:13,767
You good?

354
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:19,251
Yeah.

355
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:22,297
It's over.

356
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,603
Right?

357
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,736
It is.

358
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:28,325
You get what you wanted?

359
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:29,632
No.

360
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:32,438
And I won't.

361
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,268
Not really.

362
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,053
Well, you still got me.

363
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:43,275
Yeah?

364
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,453
Yeah.

365
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,862
New Mexico's still out there.

366
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:08,170
Maybe someday.

367
00:39:09,604 --> 00:39:11,912
Yeah.

368
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:17,178
We still have things to do here.

369
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:21,948
Did you guys set up, like,

370
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:23,124
a secret code or something

371
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:25,611
to let 'em know you're here?

372
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:29,968
Greetings!

373
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:32,721
I am Eugene Porter!

374
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:37,580
So, no code.

375
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:40,106
Or, really lame code.

376
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:05,348
We can stay in one of the cars.

377
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:08,000
Maybe in the morning...

378
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:10,393
She's not here anymore.

379
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:15,760
If she ever was...

380
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:22,188
Hey.

381
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:24,496
No regrets, Eugene.

382
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:27,327
That bolo can work its
magic some other time.

383
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:40,558
We're not turning back.

384
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:46,651
There are people out here.

385
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:49,991
Maybe not in this very train yard

386
00:42:49,994 --> 00:42:54,265
or a hundred mile radius, but they are.

387
00:42:54,268 --> 00:42:56,265
Stephanie is.

388
00:42:56,268 --> 00:42:59,751
So we'll keep trekking
until we find them.

389
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:03,666
The very reason we boldly voyaged

390
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:05,885
was to make what we built stronger

391
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:08,315
by assimilating with like-minded folks.

392
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:12,370
So we'll keep looking for them.

393
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:14,633
And assimilate we shall.

394
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:27,819
Damn, you're one really horny dude.

395
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:37,700
Weapons down!

396
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,976
Hands in the air! Now!

397
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:42,008
Move, move, move!

398
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,402
Hands up! Up!

399
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:46,937
Freeze! Hands in the air!

400
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,625
Do it now!

401
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,062
This is your last chance!

402
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:55,631
Weapons down now!

403
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:17,303
