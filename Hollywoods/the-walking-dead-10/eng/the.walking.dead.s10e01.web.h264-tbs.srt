1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:01,365
Stay with your brother.

2
00:00:01,381 --> 00:00:04,585
My mom and dad
wanted to build a better future.

3
00:00:04,617 --> 00:00:07,794
Not everyone wanted
to follow the rules.

4
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:08,607
Huh.

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,385
And our new world
is still dangerous.

6
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:13,387
We met a group

7
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:16,390
who looked like the dead
and walked like the dead.

8
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:19,876
We only want one thing
from you... my daughter!

9
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,929
It's hard to know who to trust,

10
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,380
but you got to have people
to survive.

11
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:25,307
An attack against one community

12
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,384
is an attack against all of us.

13
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:29,144
Lydia needed our help.

14
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:31,179
And caring about people

15
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:33,983
means you do whatever it takes
to keep them safe.

16
00:00:33,985 --> 00:00:37,537
We all came together
at the kingdom for the fair.

17
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,697
- Good.
- And they came for Lydia.

18
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:43,609
What they did to us,

19
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,327
to our friends...

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,496
Oh, my God. No. No!

21
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:49,423
My mom's gonna keep us safe,

22
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,992
whatever it takes...

23
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:54,428
no matter what comes next.

24
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:57,490
Over and out.

25
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:52,227
Watch your ranks.
Watch your files.

26
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:12,565
To the right.

27
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:03,891
And halt.

28
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,726
Drop.

29
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,620
Archers.

30
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:12,900
Retreat!

31
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,148
Right. And march.

32
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,974
Archers, regroup.

33
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:37,758
- Formation.
- And halt.

34
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:42,746
Spears.

35
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,922
Thrust!

36
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,037
And halt.

37
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,356
Open ranks.

38
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:42,064
Hold on, Jerry.

39
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,757
I'm tryin', boss.

40
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,236
Back up. Back up.

41
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:48,387
It's about
to get real, y'all.

42
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,738
Everyone, steady.

43
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,738
Fan out!

44
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,001
Hey,
stay in your formations!

45
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:12,686
Remember your trainin'!

46
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,459
On me.

47
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:04,721
Weirdest thing
you ever pulled outta

48
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:06,323
one of these ghost ships...
go.

49
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,633
Oh, that would
definitely be

50
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,134
the crate full
of hot-dog trophies.

51
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,110
Is that a euphemism?

52
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:11,579
What are you
talkin' 'bout?

53
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:13,722
No.

54
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:17,251
Literally trophies
shaped like dancing hot dogs.

55
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,311
- Okay.
- I mean, I guess they...

56
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,338
they sorta
looked euphemistic.

57
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:22,923
Okay.

58
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,151
Do you need help
with that?

59
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,244
- Um, no...
- Look like you need a strong woman

60
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:30,914
to help you with that...
among other things.

61
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,101
I mean, y-yes, please.

62
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,603
Thank you.

63
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,162
Hey, Jules, um...

64
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,939
a-are you...

65
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,850
Yes, I am flirting with you
a little bit, Luke.

66
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:42,943
Yes.

67
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,187
Good. That's cool.

68
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:46,521
As am I with you.

69
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,674
Oh. Well, thanks.

70
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:50,692
Training
was worth the trip.

71
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,602
- Yeah, they did good.
- Mm.

72
00:06:52,604 --> 00:06:54,288
Tara would've been proud.

73
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,349
Hm. Hope so.

74
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,518
It's good
to bring the kids also,

75
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,112
let 'em see the ocean
for the first time.

76
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:04,798
Yeah, I know one idiot
that would've loved this.

It was a fun day at the river
today, huh, R.J.?

81
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,199
Yeah.

82
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,368
Let's see
what you found.

84
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,092
Kids found it
by the estuary.

85
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,043
River must've
carried it down.

86
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:41,620
<i>What does it mean?</i>

87
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,804
<i>Are they back?</i>

88
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:44,380
We don't know.

89
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:46,625
But Alexandria should go
on lockdown just in case.

90
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,628
Hold on.

91
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,739
We don't have evidence
to justify that.

92
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,056
My official recommendation

93
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:54,908
is that everyone
should stay on alert

94
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,984
until further notice.

95
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:57,077
Eyes and ears open.

96
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,394
That's it.

97
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,565
<i>Copy that.
Over and out.</i>

98
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,084
Sounds good.

99
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,644
Over and out.

100
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:09,405
I appreciate your caution,
and I get it,

101
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,425
but we do not need
to start a panic.

102
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:14,178
A lot of stuff washed up ashore
from the recent storm.

103
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,504
Th-This might not
mean anything.

104
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,322
Or it might
mean something.

105
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,324
Look, no one saw
Alpha's herd move out,

106
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,251
so maybe no one saw them
move back in.

107
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:22,828
But if there's a mask,

108
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,588
maybe there are other signs
of them out there.

109
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,940
We owe it to our people
to be sure.

110
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:32,780
I'll gather a group.
We'll leave in five.

111
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,931
I'm-a hang back
for a bit.

112
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,599
I'll catch up.

113
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,286
Tell her not to leave again
without saying goodbye.

114
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,029
Alright.

115
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,293
Okay, let's split up.

116
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,962
You see any sign of them,
call it in.

117
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,732
- Michonne...
- Yeah.

118
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:20,977
...are we
the good guys?

119
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,487
Why would you ask that?

120
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,407
I think about it a lot.

121
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:28,335
We're the villains
of someone else's story,

122
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,486
a threat
to their survival,

123
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:33,489
so dangerous they threaten
to wipe us out.

124
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:38,570
Makes you wonder
sometimes.

125
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,330
I don't give a shit
about the Whisperers

126
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,740
or where they stand.

127
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,909
I'm not just talkin'
'bout the Whisperers.

128
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,942
Anything?

129
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,752
<i>Nothing so far.</i>

130
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:22,797
<i>Nada over here.</i>

131
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,225
You know, we may never
find an answer to this.

132
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,709
They cover their tracks.

133
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:28,787
If there's a mask,
there's a reason.

134
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,916
Come on.

135
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:34,133
Hey! Shit.

136
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:35,385
Come on.

137
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:40,574
Whoa.

138
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:50,876
Watch their hands!

139
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,942
Damn it.

140
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:03,889
Duck!

141
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,352
Well, that was stupid.

142
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,354
We agreed not
to cross their borders

143
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:21,506
or to start anything
without a reason.

144
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,024
I lost Rick on a...

145
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,443
If it was them,
you could've died.

146
00:12:33,445 --> 00:12:36,129
And it wasn't them,
and you could've died.

147
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,799
For what?

148
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:43,136
We've all been acting
like this is normal,

149
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,381
holding our breaths
for months.

150
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:48,550
This isn't normal.

151
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:51,144
We have to keep our cool,
or they win.

152
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,963
I've been keeping my cool
my whole life.

153
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:58,527
I've always been the nice guy,
the Good Samaritan.

154
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:04,232
But the thing is,
Eric is dead.

155
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:08,236
Jesus is dead.

156
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:10,330
And I'm Goddamn sick
of bein' nice.

157
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:12,557
Well, good,

158
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,984
'cause nice
never got me anywhere.

159
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:17,562
But smart did.

160
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:20,173
They have a nuclear weapon,
and we don't.

161
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,877
It's not about being nice
or good

162
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,995
or anything
but keeping our people alive

163
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,889
and not having them die
over nothing.

164
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:35,430
Believe me.

165
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,983
I hate this, too.

166
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,531
We should get back
before dark.

167
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,521
We didn't find anything.

168
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:53,707
We're circling back.

169
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,283
<i>Hold on.</i>

170
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,285
<i>There's something
you all should see.</i>

171
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:31,727
It's a campsite.

172
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:32,654
Couple people.

173
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:34,472
What am I missin'?

174
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,400
This is not what
we wanted to show you.

175
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:55,769
Campers must've
got into a fight

176
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,996
with these walkers,
right?

177
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,089
Or maybe the two things
aren't connected.

178
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:24,297
Looks like he's been here
for a while.

179
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,970
A skin.

180
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,146
So at least one of 'em
has been

181
00:15:57,148 --> 00:15:58,648
on our side of the border
at some point.

182
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,075
Yeah, but when?

183
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:03,244
And what the hell
happened here?

184
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,405
I can see what's
coming unless we stop it.

185
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,423
Fear is dangerous.

186
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,834
It can drive us apart
again.

187
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:22,747
And we're gonna need to
squash it before it starts.

188
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,025
But fear
can also keep us safe.

189
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,194
I forgot that
on the bridge.

190
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,696
I was telling you
to be smart,

191
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,699
not afraid.

192
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:36,203
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier,

193
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,914
'bout who we've become,
who we are.

194
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,194
And the truth is,

195
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:49,441
we are the good guys.

196
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,219
And I know
who Rick and Carl were...

197
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,722
and Eric and Jesus, too.

198
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,450
We have to choose
to be the good guys

199
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:02,562
even when it's hard.

200
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,974
And... the minute

201
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:09,477
that we start
to question that

202
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:13,222
and we lose sight of it,

203
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:15,175
that's when the answer
to that question

204
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:16,743
starts to change,

205
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:21,790
and that's scarier
than any skin mask.

206
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:34,836
And the Brave Man
rode the horse very, very far,

207
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:38,506
trying to lead
the gigantic herd away.

208
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,341
But after a while,

209
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:42,494
the horse got scared
and ran away,

210
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,013
leaving the Brave Man
all alone.

211
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:48,708
So the Brave Man walked
all by himself to the bridge.

212
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,019
- Remember how he built the bridge for all his friends?
- Yeah.

213
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:53,505
Well,
the millions of walkers

214
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,931
followed the Brave Man
onto the bridge,

215
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,333
and on the other side,

216
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:58,785
all his friends
were waiting.

217
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,620
The Brave Man
couldn't let the walkers

218
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,271
reach his friends
and hurt them,

219
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:03,623
so he blew up the bridge,

220
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,958
and all the walkers
fell into the water

221
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,293
and he saved
all his friends.

222
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,036
The end.

223
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:10,112
Did the Brave Man go to his
friend's house after that?

224
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:11,631
No.

225
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,525
He died
and went to heaven.

226
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:17,028
Will he come back someday,
like the walkers?

227
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,806
No, not like that.

228
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,975
But people,
like the Brave Man,

229
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,052
are never really gone
anyway.

230
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:26,938
He lives inside our hearts
and makes us brave, too.

231
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:32,152
Hey.

232
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,987
Is anybody gonna
say hi?

233
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,304
- Hi.
- Hi.

234
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:37,473
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

235
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:38,900
Come on.

236
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:43,488
Hi. Ooh.

237
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,981
You, too, baby girl.
Come here.

238
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,151
I know, I know.

239
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:50,820
Mm.

240
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:52,005
Hi.

241
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,343
Mama, I didn't like it
when the Brave Man died.

242
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:57,569
Why did he do that?

243
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,755
Well...

244
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:03,408
there are some people
that you love so much

245
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,094
that you would do
anything for them,

246
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:08,747
just like I would do
anything for you

247
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,264
and for Judith.

248
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,101
And my dad?

249
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:15,770
Yes. And your dad.

250
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:21,593
Alright, bring it back in.
Come on.

251
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:28,023
- What is that?
- What is it?

252
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:35,281
- Is that a meteor shower?
- Get back.

253
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,366
- I see it.
- Oh, I see it now.

254
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,036
What is that?

255
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,225
Michonne,
Eugene's on the radio.

256
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,968
He needs
to talk to you now.

257
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:55,643
Kids found it
by the estuary.

258
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:57,720
River must've
carried it down.

259
00:19:57,722 --> 00:19:59,722
What does it mean?

260
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:01,315
Are they back?

261
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:03,076
<i>We don't know.</i>

262
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:06,137
<i>But Alexandria should go
on lockdown just in case.</i>

263
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,563
<i>Hold on.</i>

264
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:09,732
<i>We don't have evidence
to justify that.</i>

265
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:11,400
<i>My official recommendation</i>

266
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:13,494
<i>is that everyone
should stay on alert</i>

267
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:14,662
<i>until further notice.</i>

268
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,060
Copy that.

269
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:20,653
Over and out.

270
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,026
5 minutes and 16 seconds.

271
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:28,720
Not more, not less.

272
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,814
So if I were
to heat the milk up

273
00:21:31,816 --> 00:21:33,816
for, like, 5 minutes
and 18 seconds...

274
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:35,576
I have rigged
the kitchen timer to go off

275
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:36,986
at precisely 5 and 16

276
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:38,821
so such a scenario
will not come to pass.

277
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:40,507
Furthermore,
I've taken the liberty

278
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:43,176
of chartin' her feedin's
and diaper changes.

279
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,737
She is very regular. Congratulations.

280
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,406
Eugene, she's a baby,
not a science experiment.

281
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:51,184
You can't boil people down
to charts and graphs.

282
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,261
No, you know what?
I'll take it.

283
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:57,857
Might not use it all
or, like, any of it,

284
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,417
but thanks.

285
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:00,752
You know,
ever since everyone

286
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,845
got those damn
radio setups, Eugene,

287
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:05,256
this one's been doing
nothing but talking.

288
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,283
You gotta move that thing
outta the house.

289
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:12,121
Hey, man,
is everything okay?

290
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,709
"Yes, the girl said.

291
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:20,271
I have rec..."

292
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:23,299
"Received."

293
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,628
I've gone my whole life
without reading.

294
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,039
I don't see the point
in learning how to do it now.

295
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,949
It'll open
a whole new world for you.

296
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,301
And you're picking it up
so quick.

297
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:34,519
You're a natural.

298
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,879
There's nothin' natural
about this.

299
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:45,029
We need the room.

300
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,558
Should she be here
for this?

301
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:04,591
Hey, kid.

302
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:10,338
Everything okay?

303
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,100
Fine.

304
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,995
Exactly the same as it was
20 minutes ago.

305
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:18,663
What was
the big meeting for?

306
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,773
And why are folks
givin' you the side eye?

307
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:25,002
Same folks eyein' you.

308
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,779
What have you done in the past
however many years

309
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,615
- you've been here, huh?
- Negan.

310
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:34,028
Get back to work, sir.

311
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,707
Hey, you're supposed
to keep your distance.

312
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,296
They're on alert.

313
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,614
Why?

314
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:48,468
Someone found a skin.

315
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,696
What does "alert" mean?

316
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:53,656
You've been here longer.

317
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:55,049
You tell me.

318
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:58,035
It means watch your back,
kid.

319
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:16,311
Hey, boss.

320
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,216
There you go.

321
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:37,141
Oh, hm?
Trippy, right?

322
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:40,953
Okay, you chill.

323
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:43,839
I'll be right back.

324
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:13,886
Jefe?

325
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,963
Earth to El Jefe.

326
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,392
There you are, Jef.

327
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,637
Dante.

328
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:25,898
What are you doing here?

329
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,400
Dude, your spawn was
screamin' bloody murder.

330
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:28,976
I could hear it
down in the infirmary.

331
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:30,144
I just...

332
00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:31,479
Oh, shit.

333
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:32,721
I wanted to make sure
you were cool.

334
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:33,906
Hey.

335
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,300
So...

336
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:37,726
you cool?

337
00:25:40,064 --> 00:25:42,823
Just, you know,
dealing with...

338
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:45,585
household pests
and shit.

339
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,919
Good thing I got to town

340
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,329
in time for you
to play house.

341
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,983
I reorganized the meds.

342
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,760
Infirmary's hummin'.

343
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,170
Might've earned my keep
for the day.

344
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:58,431
Though, who are we kiddin'?

345
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,841
We're like Gods
in the apocalypse.

346
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:06,773
By the way, this
yellow-alert bidness,

347
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:09,091
damn.

348
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:13,171
So what's with
this Whisperers thing?

349
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:17,191
You wanna get a room?

350
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:19,786
E-Excuse me?

351
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,596
The way
you're starin' at my mouth

352
00:26:21,598 --> 00:26:24,182
is makin' me
warm and tingly inside.

353
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,368
Kiss me already.
Shit.

354
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,704
So tempting.

355
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:33,299
Yeah.

356
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:35,860
But, uh, I need
to get this kid to sleep.

357
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:38,879
- So thank you for checkin' on me.
- Yeah.

358
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,455
Anytime, man.

359
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:44,227
Or should I say "God"?

360
00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:14,156
I'm surprised you knocked off
work early.

361
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:15,416
I thought
you couldn't get enough

362
00:27:15,418 --> 00:27:16,592
of the great outdoors.

363
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,012
It's starting.

364
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,014
Listen, if you've got
something to say,

365
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,924
can you just please
get to the point?

366
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,667
Because I don't
have time today.

367
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:27,411
- Seriously.
- Aw, Gabey boy,

368
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,747
why don't you just
nestle in below me

369
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:32,507
and let me baby bird
a little bit of my wisdom

370
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:34,861
into that pretty little mouth
of yours?

371
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:38,197
You see, people tend
to get mixed up on

372
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,867
about who they hate.

373
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:46,430
Yesterday,
I was public enemy number one.

374
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:47,573
Now?

375
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:49,100
Well, now I'm the guy

376
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:52,527
that picks the vegetables
and takes out the trash.

377
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:54,714
I'm okay with that.

378
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,874
For now, at least.

379
00:27:56,876 --> 00:28:00,294
But until
this whole thing passes,

380
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:03,580
I'm gonna keep my head down
so people don't move me

381
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,558
from the proverbial
semi-"us"  category

382
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,876
to the category
of "them."

383
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:10,621
That's not
what's happening here.

384
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:13,399
I didn't say it is.

385
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,292
I said that it will.

386
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,551
You see, the boogeyman

387
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:18,963
just stuck his
gnarly skin-covered mask

388
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:21,556
out from behind
that closet door,

389
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:24,577
and people are puttin'
their shittin' pants back on

390
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:29,064
because pants-shittin'
is definitely happenin'.

391
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:32,660
Now, with this, uh,
alert shit,

392
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:35,146
all I'm seein'
is indecision.

393
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:39,408
Now, you ask me,
you gotta make 'em feel secure,

394
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,819
even if it's just
for show.

395
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,412
Sorta like
how you have a guy

396
00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:45,431
followin' me around
with a spear all day

397
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,824
in case I suddenly decide

398
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,768
I'm gonna brain somebody
with a tomato.

399
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,012
So you're telling me
to lie?

400
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:54,256
That's your advice?

401
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:56,667
That's your regurgitated
bird wisdom?

402
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,110
No, not lie.

403
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:01,596
At most, I'm talkin' about
a little strategic omission,

404
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:05,009
maybe minor misleading.

405
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:08,362
Think of it as
using the truth to manipulate.

406
00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:11,182
But, hell,
at the end of the day,

407
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:14,943
if that's what
keeps people alive,

408
00:29:14,945 --> 00:29:16,778
what's the harm?

409
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:38,150
Lock the gates
for the night,

410
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,152
and let's double up security
at the walls.

411
00:29:54,985 --> 00:29:57,578
Alexandria to Oceanside.
Come in, Oceanside.

412
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,838
Please, pick up.

413
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,247
<i>Oceanside copies.</i>

414
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:01,990
- <i>This is Rachel.</i>
- This is Eugene.

415
00:30:01,992 --> 00:30:03,567
I need
to speak with Michonne

416
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,237
and any of the community
leadership at O.S. right away.

417
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:08,405
Somethin' of grave importance
is about to happen.

418
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,856
Kids found it
by the estuary.

419
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,432
River must've
carried it down.

420
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:20,576
<i>What does it mean?</i>

421
00:30:20,578 --> 00:30:22,086
<i>Are they back?</i>

422
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:23,187
Pull!

423
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,431
Crap.
Heads up, Kel.

424
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,856
Go further!

425
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:36,267
That's further!

426
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:37,601
Heads up behind you,
Kel.

427
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,770
Watch your step.

428
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,513
Alright, let it drop.

429
00:30:41,515 --> 00:30:42,923
Sorry.

430
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:30,381
You ever wonder
why they call bird shit "guano"?

431
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:32,140
Nah.

432
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:33,975
I just call it
bird shit.

433
00:32:33,977 --> 00:32:36,978
Yeah.

434
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,455
Me, too.

435
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:43,878
You know somethin',
when I worked in a zoo,

436
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,655
birds used to scare
the hell out of me.

437
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:48,232
Lions, tigers, no problem.

438
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,584
There's a kind of sense
to the way big cats operate.

439
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:53,828
But ostriches?

440
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,015
Those things'll disembowel you
for lookin' at 'em sideways.

441
00:32:56,017 --> 00:33:01,261
You gotta eat more birds,
show 'em who's boss.

442
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:04,264
Wonder what seagull
tastes like.

443
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:05,357
Not chicken.

444
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,907
Hi. Hi, buddy. Hi.

445
00:33:16,012 --> 00:33:17,870
Uh.

446
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:22,691
No, he just likes you
better.

447
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:24,067
Right?

448
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:27,862
Hi. Hi.

449
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:30,774
Good Dog.

450
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:42,711
Really?

451
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:49,793
Hey.

452
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,642
Carol.

453
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:14,334
Hey.

454
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:16,320
Hey.

455
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:17,396
It's good to see you.

456
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:19,506
You, too.

457
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:20,991
You look good.

458
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:22,768
Thanks.

459
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,753
Sorry. Um, excuse me.

460
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:26,663
Yeah.

461
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,174
Did ya miss me?

462
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,509
Not really.

463
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,860
I'll take that.

464
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:48,869
So, how was it
out there?

465
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:52,189
Work till you feel like
your back's gonna break,

466
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,615
then you work some more,

467
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:55,208
and at the end of the night,

468
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,469
you fall down and
sleep like the dead

469
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,972
on a deck
under the stars.

470
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:01,548
It's the best.

471
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,291
You find
what you were lookin' for?

472
00:35:03,293 --> 00:35:05,811
Oh, then we sailed down south
to this dock

473
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:09,315
where Oceanside's been
pickin' up letters from Maggie.

474
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,725
Wasn't anything there.
Hasn't been for a while.

475
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:13,894
It's been a while
since I heard from ya.

476
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:16,322
I told you,
fishing's hard.

477
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,807
That's not what I mean.

478
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:21,068
You were lookin' for her,
weren't ya?

479
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,387
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,556
Honestly, no.

481
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,816
Tried to forget
everything that happened.

482
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:29,484
It was good.

483
00:35:29,486 --> 00:35:31,319
And if we're lucky,
we'll never have to think about

484
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:33,797
those skin freaks
ever again.

485
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,844
What?

486
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:41,388
We found
one of their masks today.

487
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:46,744
Okay.

488
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:48,670
Michonne just took a group out
looking for signs of 'em.

489
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:50,314
You wanna go?

490
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:54,676
No.

491
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:55,861
I'm only... I'm only here

492
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:58,255
till the next boat
heads out.

493
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,532
Alright.

494
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:03,168
So, what you wanna do?

495
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,188
Never been
through here before.

496
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,949
Yeah,
we just cleared it out

497
00:36:08,951 --> 00:36:10,709
to get around
the river border.

498
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:14,195
Faster.

499
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:15,622
Hang on.

500
00:36:36,052 --> 00:36:37,886
I had that one.

501
00:36:37,888 --> 00:36:40,739
Well, you're supposed
to call it.

502
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,799
You didn't call it.

503
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,058
Don't wanna play
with you anymore

504
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,393
if you cheat every time.

505
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:46,745
I'm not cheating.

506
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,475
Watch their hands.

507
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,784
Stop.

508
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:44,136
Why?

509
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:46,713
It's one of her borders.

510
00:37:46,715 --> 00:37:47,806
They're walkers.

511
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,549
We can still get the deer.

512
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:51,384
No, it's too late.

513
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:54,629
Why are we still respecting
borders we never agreed to

514
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:56,373
when Alpha
isn't even here?

515
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,876
- Can we just forget bout them already?
- It's too late.

516
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:08,902
That deer could've fed
200 people.

517
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:23,324
I'm sorry
I pissed you off.

518
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:26,327
I'm sorry you pissed me off,
too.

519
00:38:26,922 --> 00:38:29,740
Well, there's no reason
to start shit if we don't gotta.

520
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,934
After the storm,
we all agreed to that.

521
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,763
That's why it's just as well
that I left.

522
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:42,419
Yeah, I've been
thinkin' about that.

523
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:45,364
Why don't
you come on home now?

524
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,924
I'm a sea dog, man.

525
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,495
Would you get off my ass
before I put you on yours?

526
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:55,023
Sorry if I didn't want
my best friend

527
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:58,101
to spend her whole life
on a boat.

528
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,287
Best friend?

529
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:01,939
What are you, 10?

530
00:39:01,941 --> 00:39:03,549
Whatever.

531
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,242
Should we have
matching bracelets now?

532
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:07,961
Oh, God, forget it.

533
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:10,204
No, I could make some
with fisherman's twine.

534
00:39:10,206 --> 00:39:12,190
Decorate 'em.

535
00:39:12,192 --> 00:39:13,725
It'll be really cute
with tiny, little seashells.

536
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,227
Oh, my God.
I take it back.

537
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,895
No,
what's your favorite color?

538
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,546
Green? Blue?

539
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:21,308
Black.
Definitely black.

540
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,626
I got an idea.

541
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:24,486
Why don't we eat
and not talk?

542
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,483
Should we make
a matching collar for Dog?

543
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,741
Daryl?

544
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:50,337
Yeah?

545
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:53,599
You ever wonder
if this is all there is?

546
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:57,010
Just run into people,

547
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:58,604
kill each other

548
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,847
until whoever's left
says enough?

549
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:02,941
Sometimes
I think we're just survivin'

550
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,684
one fight to the next.

551
00:40:04,686 --> 00:40:07,613
It was like that for you and me
before all this.

552
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,430
Yep.

553
00:40:09,432 --> 00:40:12,192
There's got to be people
out there like us.

554
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:14,435
Right?

555
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,294
I get what Maggie's doin'
with Georgie.

556
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:24,779
I do.

557
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:30,027
Go out on the boat with me
this time.

558
00:40:31,454 --> 00:40:33,196
Just run away together?

559
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,867
Be pirates. Heck yeah.

560
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:38,285
Nah.

561
00:40:38,287 --> 00:40:40,887
Cooped up in those little cabins
all day?

562
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:43,874
That's not me.

563
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:45,225
Screw the boat.

564
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:48,228
We'll take your bike
and go out on the road.

565
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,121
Better.

566
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:51,623
Head out West.

567
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,808
New Mexico.

568
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,386
What the hell's
in New Mexico?

569
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:58,388
People
who weave bracelets.

570
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,245
No more fightin'.

571
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:07,747
Just get on the bike
and go,

572
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:09,424
see who's left.

573
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,835
Sounds good to me.

574
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,863
- This is crazy. We can't do this.
- We don't have a choice.

575
00:41:53,865 --> 00:41:55,215
If we get caught on
their side of the border,

576
00:41:55,217 --> 00:41:57,872
- that's it, that's war.
- It's a fire. Fires spread.

577
00:41:57,874 --> 00:42:00,633
- It could burn through our hunting grounds.
- Or take out Oceanside.

578
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:03,954
Michonne,
are we doin' this?

579
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:06,806
- We gotta go now.
- Let's go. Come on.

580
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:41,566
We start on the outside,
push in.

581
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:09,185
It's gonna be
a long night, son.

582
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,279
A long, hot night.

583
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:17,544
As soon as you clear
your area, move to the ends.

584
00:43:17,546 --> 00:43:19,471
Keep digging.

585
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:21,956
We've gotta get this done
before the fire jumps spine.

586
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:24,792
- Come on.
- God damn it.

587
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:26,553
Magna.

588
00:43:26,555 --> 00:43:28,796
Magna.

589
00:43:28,798 --> 00:43:30,974
- Magna.
- What?

590
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,609
- You're spinning out.
- I'm fine.

591
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,319
No, you're not.
What's wrong?

592
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:36,546
Look around.

593
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,446
- Where we going? Where we going?
- To the fire line.

594
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:55,674
Grab your bucket.

595
00:43:58,403 --> 00:43:59,845
Alright,
everybody clear back.

596
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:01,588
Clear back.

597
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,423
We need to back-burn
the stray fuel

598
00:44:03,425 --> 00:44:05,350
by the control line
so the fire can't spread.

599
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:06,685
Let's light it up.

600
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:43,780
Yo, boss.

601
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:45,690
Not your boss, Jerry.

602
00:44:45,692 --> 00:44:47,133
Pace yourself maybe.

603
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:49,360
It's gonna take a minute.

604
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,622
Fire was the beginning
of the end for the Kingdom.

605
00:44:52,624 --> 00:44:54,548
We're not letting that happen
to Oceanside.

606
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:57,218
You okay, boss?

607
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,388
Let me take point
in this round, okay?

608
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,753
I'm outta water.

609
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,220
I'm out.

610
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:25,913
Hey!
Walkers coming in!

611
00:45:25,915 --> 00:45:27,991
- On your six!
- Daryl.

612
00:45:27,993 --> 00:45:30,160
Bring the weapons.

613
00:45:33,756 --> 00:45:35,756
Heads up!

614
00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:38,001
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

615
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:57,278
How many we got?

616
00:46:21,637 --> 00:46:24,214
Come on!

617
00:46:24,216 --> 00:46:26,733
Let's stay on the fire.
Put it out.

618
00:46:26,735 --> 00:46:29,152
Walkers!

619
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:30,978
There's too many!

620
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,567
Lead them to the fire!

621
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:15,356
Come on! Go, go!

622
00:47:17,193 --> 00:47:19,452
Hurry!

623
00:47:24,684 --> 00:47:26,793
Here!

624
00:47:31,074 --> 00:47:33,132
Watch your back!

625
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:03,237
There's too many of 'em!

626
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,665
Everyone, stay clear
of that tree!

627
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,317
It's gonna fall any minuto!

628
00:48:09,504 --> 00:48:11,412
Get back.

629
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:15,583
Get outta here!

630
00:49:01,797 --> 00:49:03,815
Come on, come on.
Pack up and move.

631
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:06,376
Let's go, let's go!

632
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:08,828
Eugene, let's go.

633
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,305
- I just need 20 minutes.
- You get zero.

634
00:49:11,307 --> 00:49:13,550
- We gotta go now.
- Ten. Just 10.

635
00:49:13,552 --> 00:49:15,976
We should excavate and transport
this satellite to our vehicles.

636
00:49:15,978 --> 00:49:19,313
I believe there may be invaluable technological
implications for our communities

637
00:49:19,315 --> 00:49:22,149
if I'm able to retrieve any of
the useful bits from inside.

638
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:24,243
- I'm not askin'.
- Oh, my God.

639
00:49:24,245 --> 00:49:27,730
Yumiko, Luke, Magna,
everybody, come on.

640
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:31,009
We're helpin' with the satellite.
Five minutes and out.

641
00:49:34,589 --> 00:49:40,426
Hey, uh, Eugenius,
what about radiation, man?

642
00:49:40,428 --> 00:49:42,687
Uh, there's radiation
all around us.

643
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:44,747
Certainly, there's radiation
from space,

644
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:47,600
but every one of us is already
infected with some kinda nasty

645
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:50,962
that changes us into epidermis
Epicureans at point of R.I.P.

646
00:49:50,964 --> 00:49:53,698
- I mean, I don't understand what you're talkin' about.
- I got it, man.

647
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,776
No one's gettin' superpowers
today. I'm on it.

648
00:49:56,778 --> 00:49:59,929
Cuttin' into my 10 minutes.

649
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:02,356
Alright.

650
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:06,118
We made
the right choice.

651
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,529
Let's not push our luck.

652
00:50:08,531 --> 00:50:10,698
Well, maybe this
buys us some goodwill.

653
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,866
This helps them, too.

654
00:50:12,868 --> 00:50:14,460
We helped <i>our</i> people.

655
00:50:14,462 --> 00:50:16,763
That's enough good for me
for now.

656
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:21,968
Where are Carol
and Daryl?

657
00:50:32,647 --> 00:50:36,407
You still wanna run away
together?

658
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,226
Yeah.

659
00:50:39,228 --> 00:50:41,538
Tomorrow.

660
00:50:43,825 --> 00:50:46,900
Look, I need you to stay.

661
00:50:51,165 --> 00:50:54,150
Just think about it.

662
00:50:57,597 --> 00:51:01,749
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to
punch holes in all them boats.

663
00:51:53,627 --> 00:51:56,081
