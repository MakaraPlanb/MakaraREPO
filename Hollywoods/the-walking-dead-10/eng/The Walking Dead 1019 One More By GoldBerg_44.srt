320

He says, "We have to get
there before the others!"

321
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,770
And he's running stop signs

322

and saying a prayer each time he does,

323
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,990

324

And we get there, and he...

325
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,850
He heads straight for
the liquor cabinet.

And he snatches off my collar.

329

his. And he starts pouring.

330

And then Tommy's father walks in.

331

332
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,370
two drinks in hand...

333
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,810

334
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,680
...he just starts talking.

335
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,720
He talks to everyone...

336
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,300

337
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,560

338
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,650
Laughing.

339
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,180
And he tells me, you know...

340
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,140
all I have to do

341
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,570
is be with them,

342
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,160
in the moment...

343
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,980
S-speak from my heart

344
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,090

I think they want to hear.

345
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:17,020
And I... I try, but I'm...
I'm not as good at it as he is.

346
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,480
And then later he tells me

347
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,500
that real ministering isn't
preaching from a pulpit.

348
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,080
