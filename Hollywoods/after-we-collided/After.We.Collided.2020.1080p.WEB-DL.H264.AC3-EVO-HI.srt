really take you by surprise.

- Hi.
- Hi.

529
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:44,667
You're probably goin'
out of town for break,

530
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:47,233
so just wanna say happy
holidays, and a happy birthday.

531
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:50,033
- It's your birthday, right?
- Tomorrow.

532
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:52,166
I made you something.

533
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,333
What's... What's this?

534
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,833
(CLEARS THROAT) It is a
cost analysis breakdown

535
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:01,666
of your weekly Uber expenditure

536
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,999
versus owning a used car.

537
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:06,633
Okay...

538
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,999
I know. It's just,
turns out you're wasting a lot of money.

539
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:13,799
I did a little research,
and I found a 2013 Toyota Corolla,

540
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,799
in town, in excellent condition.

541
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,732
I went down to the dealership,
negotiated terms,

542
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:22,233
and you'd put no money down,
you only pay 150 bucks a month.

543
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:25,166
Vance also agreed to put your
auto insurance on company policy,

544
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,799
so that's free.

545
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,666
This is, of course,
if you want to do it.

546
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:29,720

548
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,100
- I take it you...
- Oh, my God! Mwah!

549
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:35,233
Thank you.

550
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,899

554

it's, uh...

555
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,866
it's very Tessa.

556
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:54,833
I will take that
as a compliment.

557
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:56,966
I'm right up there.

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,133

Um, I'm actually looking
at your birthday horoscope.

560
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:09,066
So first off,
you share a birthday with...

561
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,599
- Joseph Stalin.
- Great.

562
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:15,899
- You are a proud, idealistic person...
- Like Stalin.

563
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:19,066
You are more emotional
than is obvious.

564
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,033
You may solidify
a romantic relationship

565
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:27,266
or become involved
with a mature partner.

566
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:29,401
Mature.
That doesn't really sound...

567
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:31,833
No, it doesn't.

568
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,267
He left for London.

569
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:35,732
Have you heard from him?

570
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,301
I haven't,
because I blocked him.

571
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,632
That'll work.

572
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:44,666
Bye.

I was gonna meet you!

how pretty you are.

gonna be covered in tattoos,

and a piercing on your bean.

- Mum.

I didn't want to go without
you, so she came here.

Why didn't you tell her
that we broke up?

606

She was so excited
when I told her first,

607
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,388
- I couldn't ruin it for her.
- Hardin!

I couldn't tell her

- Yeah.

704
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:08,633
Will you apologize to your mum
for us kidnapping you last night?

705
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,733
I will.

706
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:15,834
I can't tell you how much it means
to me to see Hardin this way.

707

708
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:20,133

Okay... (LAUGHS)

728

Your mom told me that you were comin' home
today, so I figured I'd come greet you.

729
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:11,866
Did she have you on speed dial

- That's you.
- Yeah? Yeah.

737
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:28,133
Your mom told me
about the internship.

738
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:30,400
- That's really awesome.
- Thanks. Yeah.

739

- What?

00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,033
Okay, that was rude.

but I chased him off.

758
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:11,633
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

759
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,366
I'm not getting worked up!

760
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,421
I just don't understand why
you'd keep that a secret.

761
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:19,066
And you never kept
any secrets from me?

True, but you
had to snoop around

839

I hear that

1084
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:09,088
this is your first time
in the States?

1085
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,066
- Yeah, it is.
- And how do you like it?

01:03:22,301 --> 01:03:24,599
Yeah, of course I am.

Thank you.

We stayed in

1097
01:03:38,334 --> 01:03:41,666
Did you know that
the beaches in Santorini

1098
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:43,833
are made up of volcanic pebbles,

1099
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:46,999
so there's no sand
to make the water murky.

1100
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:49,233
So it is a crystal-clear...

I'm sorry, Mum,
but seriously,

1104
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,632
do you have any sensitivity
whatsoever?

1105
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,033
You're just boorishly droning on

the lives you destroyed.

1107
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:05,866
P-Perhaps we could find
a more private place

1108
01:04:05,899 --> 01:04:08,966
- to have this conversation.
- By all means.

Okay, well, you are obviously
quite upset with me,

01:04:15,799 --> 01:04:18,166
so go ahead and say
what's on your mind.

1112

Why did you even invite us here?

1113
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,033
I invited you here
because you're my family.

We <i>were</i> your family.

we supposed to get past it?

(LOWER) Tessa.

1751
01:39:35,134 --> 01:39:36,899
Do you like to go on dates?

1752
01:39:36,933 --> 01:39:38,234
Because I don't.

1753
01:39:38,267 --> 01:39:40,766
But I-I will... with you.

That's so creepy.

I've been meaning to tell you
something for a long time,

and the reason
that I haven't told you

1760
01:39:52,201 --> 01:39:54,632
is because of Human Resources
in the workplace.

1761
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:56,201
Don't talk about
Human Resources.

1762
