1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,463
( snarling )

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,260
It's the only way.

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,556
No one else knows.

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,392
You gonna tell 'em?

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,268
Not till after.

6
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,357
We have to do it today.
It has to be quiet.

7
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,739
You got a plan?

8
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,908
We tell her we need
to talk.

9
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,577
Away from the others.

10
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,087
Just ain't us, man.

11
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,257
No. No, it isn't.

12
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,013
We do this,

13
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,932
we avoid a fight.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,059
No one else dies.

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,022
All right.

16
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,277
We need someone else.

17
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,365
I'll talk to him.

18
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,200
I'll do it.

19
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,910
- I'll go with you.
- No.

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,455
Just me.

21
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,922
( fabric ripping )

22
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,277
Just looking
for a little vacation.

23
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,156
Best dope I ever had
was in a mattress.

24
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,703
Nothing.

25
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,334
This place must have
been no fun at all.

26
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,877
We need your help.

27
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,254
( laughs )

28
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,310
Do you even know why
you do the things you do?

29
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,687
The choices you make?

30
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,288
If we give
the Governor Michonne,

31
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,957
Woodbury stands down.

32
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,752
I don't like it, but it's what needs
to be done.

33
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,089
We need to make it quiet.
We need your help with that.

34
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,928
You ain't told
any of the others, huh?

35
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,889
Just Hershel,
Daryl and you.

36
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,934
Huh.

37
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,061
The inner circle.

38
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,813
I'm honored.

39
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,732
( chuckles )

40
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,443
You know,

41
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,237
when we'd go out on runs,

42
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,823
he'd bash
somebody's skull,

43
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,033
slash somebody's throat,

44
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,078
and he'd say,
"Never waste a bullet."

45
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,081
I always thought
it was just an excuse.

46
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,588
You go on.

47
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,757
Give him that girl.

48
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,886
He ain't gonna
kill her, you know.

49
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,598
He's just gonna
do things to her.

50
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,058
Probably take out
one of her eyes.

51
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,644
Both of 'em, most likely.

52
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,606
You'd let that happen

53
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,858
for a shot?

54
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,696
Whew.

55
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,449
You're cold as ice,
Officer Friendly.

56
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,998
You're gonna need wire,

57
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,958
not rope.

58
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,295
Wire. Nothing she could
chew through.

59
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,297
( chuckles )

60
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,591
Oh.

61
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,468
You know something?

62
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,513
You're right.

63
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,266
I don't know why
I do the things I do.

64
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,935
Never did.

65
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,439
I'm a damn mystery to me.

66
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,408
But I know you, Rick.

67
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,665
Yeah, I thought
a lot about you.

68
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,876
You ain't got
the spine for it.

69
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,004
We need to get her
to the Governor by noon.

70
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,394
( theme music playing )

71
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,597
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( Maggie shouting )

72
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,184
- Carl: Hey! Come on! Over here!
- ( pots clanging )

73
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,353
- Hey! Come on!
- Maggie: Over here!

74
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,897
Hey! Right here!

75
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,067
Over here!

76
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,069
- Come on!
- Here! Here!

77
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,571
Come on!

78
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:08,034
( shouting continues )

79
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,300
Daryl:
Come on, let's go.

80
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,538
They try to drive up
to the gate again,

81
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,457
maybe some blown tires
will stop them.

82
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,794
- That's a good idea.
- It was Michonne's.

83
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,130
We don't have to win.

84
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,799
We just have to make
their getting at us

85
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,426
more trouble
than it's worth.

86
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,971
( gate closes )

87
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,394
Hey.

88
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,357
Let's go.

89
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,118
Ain't no way.

90
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,204
Carol:
What?

91
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,164
Nothing.

92
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,125
What happened here?

93
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,795
We got any whiskey?

94
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,880
Hell, I'd even drink vodka.

95
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,382
Go to hell, Merle.

96
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,176
( laughs )

97
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,312
Are you with us?

98
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,440
Sure.

99
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,778
I'm not talking about
occupying the same space.

100
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,074
Are you with us?

101
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,245
I'm here for my brother.

102
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,706
Well, he's here for us.

103
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,752
It's not time to do shots.

104
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,338
It's time to pick
a damn side.

105
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,591
( laughs )

106
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,594
You ain't like you was
back in the camp--

107
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,014
a little mouse
running around,

108
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,849
scared of her own shadow.

109
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,729
It wasn't my shadow,
it was my husband's.

110
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,901
Well, you don't seem
scared of nothing anymore.

111
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,487
I'm not.

112
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,573
Hmm.

113
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,241
You're a late bloomer.

114
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,912
Maybe you are, too.

115
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,837
Hey.

116
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,505
You seen Merle around?

117
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,480
He say he was sorry yet?

118
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,445
'Cause he is.

119
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,953
He's gonna make it right.

120
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,621
I'm gonna make him.

121
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,082
There's got to be a way.

122
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,962
Just needs to be a little
forgiveness is all.

123
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,969
He tied me to a chair,

124
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,846
beat me, and threw
a walker in the room.

125
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,598
Maybe I could call it even.

126
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,141
But he--

127
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,852
he took Maggie to a man
who terrorized her,

128
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,854
humiliated her.

129
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,317
I care more about her
than I care about me.

130
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,007
( metal clinking )

131
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,009
Merle.

132
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,177
You down here?

133
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,641
Merle.

134
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,649
Hey, little brother.

135
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,651
What the hell?

136
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,195
I was just about
to holler back at ya.

137
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,033
What you doing down here?

138
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,202
Just looking for
a little crystal meth.

139
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,041
Yeah, yeah, I know.

140
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,626
Shit will mess
my life up

141
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,546
when everything is
going so sweet, right?

142
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,465
( laughs )

143
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,133
You talk to Rick yet?

144
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,636
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I'm in.

145
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,805
But, uh,

146
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,682
he ain't got
the stomach for it.

147
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,853
He's gonna buckle.
You know that, right?

148
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,563
Yeah.

149
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,857
If he does, he does.

150
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,734
You want him to?

151
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,822
Whatever he says goes.

152
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,408
( scoffs )
Man.

153
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,828
Do you even possess

154
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,081
a pair of balls,
little brother?

155
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,375
Are they even attached?

156
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,420
I mean, if they are,
do they belong to you?

157
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,007
You used to call people
like that sheep.

158
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,259
What happened to you?

159
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,680
What happened
with you and Glenn

160
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,474
and Maggie?

161
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,684
I've done worse.

162
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,440
You need to grow up.

163
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,609
Things are different now.

164
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,368
Your people look at me
like I'm the devil...

165
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,332
grabbing up those lovebirds
like that, huh?

166
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,794
Now y'all want to do
the same damn thing I did--

167
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,171
snatch someone up
and deliver them to the Governor,

168
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,549
just like me.

169
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,467
Yeah.

170
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,720
People do what they
got to do or they die.

171
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,392
Can't do things without
people anymore, man.

172
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,478
( scoffs )

173
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,815
Maybe these people need
somebody like me around, huh?

174
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,609
Do their dirty work.

175
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,156
The bad guy.

176
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,783
Yeah, maybe that's how
it is now, huh?

177
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,579
How does that hit you?

178
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,044
I just want
my brother back.

179
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,923
Get out of here, man.

180
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,696
Hershel:
"Thou shalt not be afraid

181
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,740
for the terror by night.

182
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:49,870
Nor for the arrow
that flieth by day.

183
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:56,543
Nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness.

184
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,255
Nor for the destruction

185
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,592
that wasteth at noonday.

186
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,516
1,000 shall fall at thy side

187
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,561
and 10,000
at thy right hand.

188
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,816
But it shall not come
nigh thee.

189
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,906
Only with thine eyes

190
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,116
shalt thou behold

191
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,286
and see the reward
of the wicked.

192
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,044
Surely He shall
deliver thee

193
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,713
from the snare
of the fowler

194
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,883
and from the noisome
pestilence."

195
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,261
You're not there.

196
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,181
She's not there.

197
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,939
Hershel:
"He shall cover thee

198
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,526
and under His wings
shalt thou trust.

199
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,949
There shall no evil
befall thee.

200
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,789
Neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling."

201
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,464
You okay?

202
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,969
What I wouldn't do

203
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,846
to keep you two safe.

204
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,556
( door opens )

205
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,017
Rick?

206
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,354
What you're
about to do--

207
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,565
I can't.

208
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,193
I won't.

209
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,117
- Michonne: So where is it?
- Merle: Around the corner.

210
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,619
We got to clear
some walkers,

211
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,329
then get the others
down here to barricade it.

212
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,832
A breach like this could be
an open invitation to the Governor.

213
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,840
He's not much
for subtlety.

214
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,843
( snarling )

215
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,680
You want to take
your chances?

216
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,737
( grunts )

217
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,238
Governor made Rick
an offer.

218
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:15,242
Turn you over and we all give
peace a chance.

219
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,494
I agree with you, though.
He would have blinked.

220
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,579
But not you.

221
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,081
( scoffs )

222
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,749
I'm being
straight with you.

223
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,043
You were straight
when you led me into the tombs.

224
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,878
Okay, maybe
I wasn't straight.

225
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,714
You put a bag
over my head.

226
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,799
I got it done.

227
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,384
He wouldn't have.

228
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,553
Keep moving.

229
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,309
He was a guy that came back
for me on that rooftop.

230
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,311
Nah.

231
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,106
It's all on me.

232
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,150
You know?

233
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,945
I figure that's why I was back
there in the first place.

234
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,947
Do the dirty work.

235
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,075
( walker growling )

236
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,287
( laughing )

237
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,375
May I?

238
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,297
I'll take that as a yes.

239
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,674
( growling )

240
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,103
( laughs )

241
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,772
Oh!

242
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,316
You know what?
I'd figured you would have run.

243
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,029
Wanted my sword back
before I get away.

244
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,323
( laughs )

245
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,326
It may go down
that way.

246
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,162
But if I were you,

247
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,997
I wouldn't get
my hopes up.

248
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,254
Move.

249
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,846
It's off.
We'll take our chances.

250
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,556
I'm not saying
it was the wrong call,

251
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,017
but this is definitely
the right one.

252
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,186
What's wrong?

253
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,146
I can't find Merle
or Michonne.

254
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,190
They've gone.

255
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,108
Come on.

256
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,865
He was in here.

257
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,826
Said he was looking
for drugs.

258
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,578
Said a lot of things, actually.

259
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,080
Like what?

260
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,083
Said that you were gonna
change your mind. Here we go.

261
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,628
Yeah, he took her here.
They mixed it up.

262
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,256
Damn it!
I'm going after him.

263
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,967
- You can't track for shit.
- Then the both of us.

264
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,134
No, just me.

265
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,762
I said I'd go and I'll go.

266
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,264
Plus they're gonna
come back here.

267
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,099
You need to be ready.

268
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,934
Your family, too.

269
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,107
I want to be
with my brother.

270
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,070
My brother, he wants
to be in the prison.

271
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,075
This little trip...

272
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,497
maybe it'll keep
that place standing.

273
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,793
If I pull it off,
maybe all is forgiven.

274
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,255
That's a whole lot
of maybes.

275
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,926
You got to play
the hand you're dealt.

276
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,262
I only got one.

277
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,652
You talk about the weight

278
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,113
of what you have to do,

279
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,449
how you can handle it.

280
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,492
A bad man,

281
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,953
someone truly evil,

282
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,623
they're light as a feather.

283
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,791
They don't feel a thing.

284
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,922
I've killed 16 men
since all this went down.

285
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,845
- Let's go.
- ( walkers snarling )

286
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,445
Look at what
that bastard's done.

287
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,322
Look at us.

288
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,616
He's one man.

289
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,242
There'll be others
like him.

290
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,495
There always have been.

291
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,457
I know.
It's like the walkers.

292
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,626
There's nothing
we can do.

293
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,351
When you gave me this...

294
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:57,357
I didn't fully understand
what it meant.

295
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,612
Such a simple thing.

296
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,200
I know what it means now.

297
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,870
I know what it takes.

298
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,046
I want to marry Maggie.

299
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,049
And we don't have
to have a wedding.

300
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,884
I don't even know
if we'll last the week.

301
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,763
But I want her to know

302
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,808
before...

303
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,476
who knows?

304
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,105
You have my blessing.

305
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,571
Thank you.

306
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,050
All right.

307
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,718
I think we're good.

308
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,304
Yeah, we're great.

309
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,146
( engine sputtering )

310
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,315
Come on.

311
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,819
- ( engine starts )
- Yeah!

312
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,030
That's the deal.

313
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,449
- ( car alarm blaring )
- Oh, shit.

314
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,250
( walkers snarling )

315
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,137
Merle!

316
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,682
Come on, Merle!

317
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,355
Merle!

318
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,211
Okay. Okay.

319
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,256
( alarm chirps,
blaring stops )

320
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,341
Ah!

321
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,284
Come on.

322
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,453
Let's go!

323
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,464
( tires squealing )

324
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,902
So is this your thing, then?
You take out the trash?

325
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,279
Don't be so hard
on yourself, darlin'.

326
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,032
The Governor, Rick,

327
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,700
anyone who needs
their piss bucket emptied

328
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,369
and you come a-running.

329
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,288
( laughs )

330
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,249
Things are different
for your brother.

331
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,209
Yeah, they are.

332
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,045
Rick says jump
and he wants to know how high.

333
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,130
Mm-mmm.
Rick needs him.

334
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,049
Respects him.

335
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,551
He didn't ask him to do
this little job, now, did he?

336
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,638
No, 'cause he wants it done.

337
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,890
You keep telling
yourself that.

338
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,186
The truth is this could
have been your shot.

339
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:49,023
With your skills,
a whole new beginning.

340
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,736
But you choose
to stay on the outside.

341
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,450
No one's gonna mourn you,

342
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,661
not even Daryl.

343
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,039
He's got a new family.

344
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,501
You keep trying
to get under my skin,

345
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,628
I'm gonna cut
that tongue out.

346
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,172
Your buddy's
turning you over

347
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,842
'cause he's trying
to save his own ass.

348
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,596
You're as much
on the outside as I am, girl.

349
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,683
Maybe.

350
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,853
But once the Governor's
done with me,

351
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:29,272
at least I won't have
to live with myself.

352
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,697
( walkers growling )

353
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,600
( bones crunch )

354
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:23,159
You said you killed 16 men
since this thing started?

355
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,414
You ever kill
anyone before?

356
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,833
No.

357
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,587
And how about
before Woodbury?

358
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,672
Before you met him?

359
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,886
Huh.

360
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,347
So he saves your life,

361
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,265
cleans you up,

362
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,393
fed you a line of bullshit.

363
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,187
Why would you kill
somebody else for him?

364
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,316
You know, we can go back.

365
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,193
( chuckles )

366
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,694
Ain't happening.

367
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,613
Both of us.

368
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,698
We can just go back.

369
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,791
I can't go back.

370
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,460
Don't you understand that?

371
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,295
I can't.

372
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,632
Why?

373
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,801
( brakes squealing )

374
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,578
You go back with them.

375
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,830
Get ready for what's next.

376
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,546
I got something
I got to do on my own.

377
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,513
( snarling )

378
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,556
Hey!

379
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,142
Where's my brother?

380
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,064
You kill him?

381
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,152
He let me go.

382
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,613
Don't let anyone
come after me.

383
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,790
( music playing
over radio )

384
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,007
( music continues )

385
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,607
( laughs )

386
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,037
( turns up volume )

387
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,148
( music continues )

388
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,030
( music continues )

389
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,248
Man:
Where's it coming from?

390
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,668
Come on, come on.
With me.

391
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,629
We'll have to spread out!

392
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,048
You two with me.

393
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,677
Walkers!

394
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,680
All over!

395
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,394
Where's Michonne?

396
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,914
( screaming )

397
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,210
( gunfire continues )

398
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,481
Hey, over there.

399
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,655
( snarling )

400
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,083
( grunting )

401
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,590
You leave him to me!

402
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,134
( groans )

403
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,973
( groaning )

404
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,641
( shouts )

405
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,358
( screaming )

406
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,530
- ( arm cracks )
- ( groans )

407
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,202
( choking )

408
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,289
( coughs )

409
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,335
I ain't gonna beg.

410
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:32,046
I ain't begging you.

411
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,173
No.

412
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,857
- Hey.
- Hey.

413
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,567
Carl was looking for you.

414
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,361
He found me.

415
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:59,240
I think we should head over.
Rick has something to say.

416
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,034
Uh, just...

417
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,912
one more thing
before that.

418
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,874
Here.

419
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,936
Yes.

420
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,270
When I met
with the Governor,

421
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:14,273
he offered me a deal.

422
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,693
He said--

423
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,321
he said he would
leave us alone

424
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,865
if I gave him Michonne.

425
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,371
And I was gonna do that...

426
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,501
to keep us safe.

427
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,930
I changed my mind.

428
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,893
But now Merle took Michonne
to fulfill the deal

429
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,227
and Daryl went
to stop him

430
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,396
and I don't know
if it's too late.

431
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:01,487
I was wrong
not to tell you.

432
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,076
And I'm sorry.

433
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,414
What I said last year,

434
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,500
that first night

435
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,210
after the farm...

436
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,631
it can't be like that.

437
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,841
It can't.

438
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,804
What we do,
what we're willing to do,

439
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:30,683
who we are,
it's not my call.

440
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,518
It can't be.

441
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,564
I couldn't sacrifice one of us
for the greater good

442
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,193
because we are
the greater good.

443
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,445
We're the reason
we're still here,

444
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,781
not me.

445
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,200
This is life and death.

446
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,536
How you live...

447
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,123
how you die--

448
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,000
it isn't up to me.

449
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,294
I'm not your Governor.

450
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,047
We choose to go.

451
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:06,510
We choose to stay.

452
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,554
We stick together.

453
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,517
We vote.

454
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,561
We can stay
and we can fight

455
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,981
or we can go.

456
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,655
( munching )

457
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,239
( snarling )

458
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,508
( crying )

459
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,907
No!

460
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,048
- ( grunts )
- ( growling )

461
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,228
( crying )

462
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,918
( theme music playing )
