1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,548
( breathing deeply )

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,349
Merle: You don't even know
why you're here, do you?

3
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,687
I didn't mean you
no harm.

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,980
I lowered my gun,

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,067
but you raised yours.

6
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,322
You were an asshole
out there,

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,866
just like you were on that rooftop
back there in Atlanta.

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,621
What y'all did,
leaving me up there--

9
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,541
people wouldn't
do that to an animal.

10
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,042
We went back for you.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,586
Ain't you thoughtful?

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,672
We did, all of us--

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,799
Rick, Daryl, T-Dog.

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,553
Mm, T-Dog.

15
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,972
Yeah, big ol' spear-chucker,

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,474
the one I was pleading with.

17
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,935
Mm-hmm, the one
that dropped the key.

18
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,270
Tell me where he's at.

19
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,897
I'm sure T-Dog would like
to bury the hatchet,

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,443
let bygones be bygones.

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,611
He didn't make it.

22
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,533
Well, I hope he went slow.

23
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,702
Yeah.

24
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,499
How about the rest?

25
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,668
Hmm?

26
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,379
How about
my baby brother?

27
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,214
You can't tell me he's alive

28
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,134
and then hold off
on where he is.

29
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,554
No?

30
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:41,184
Well, maybe the farmer's
daughter will help me out.

31
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,484
Merle:
Tell me something--

32
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,653
when she's scared

33
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,990
and she's holding
you close,

34
00:01:56,158 --> 00:02:01,329
and her trembling skin

35
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:04,040
is close to you,

36
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,377
her soft lips
are touching you

37
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,798
here, all over here,

38
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,591
and over here...

39
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,384
( gasps )

40
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,179
feels good, don't it?

41
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,643
I remember you.

42
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,186
Yeah.

43
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,481
You're the sneaky one,
the one with nerve.

44
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,983
You don't scare easy,
do you?

45
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,155
I like that.

46
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,954
Now...

47
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:47,500
I wanna know
where my brother is.

48
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,669
- ( grunts )
- ( muffled grunts )

49
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,838
( grunts echoing )

50
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:00,304
I wanna know
where the sheriff is.

51
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,764
Ah! God!

52
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,058
( grunts echoing )

53
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,561
Ah!

54
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,734
( chuckles )

55
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,947
Merle: Yeah.

56
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,074
Now, I wanna know
where they're hiding,

57
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,909
where your camp is,

58
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,161
and I wanna know now.

59
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,834
- Merle: I wanna know now!
- ( punches thudding )

60
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:33,462
- Where the hell are they? Tell me!
- ( punches thudding )

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,924
( theme music playing )

62
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,210
( walkers rasping )

63
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,844
( snarling )

64
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,318
( groans )

65
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,368
( growls )

66
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,339
Should we help her?

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,199
( snarling echoes )

68
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,495
( slowing heartbeats )

69
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,374
( noises fade )

70
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,464
( gunshots )

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,300
Carl!

72
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,681
Shit.

73
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,907
Is she bit?

74
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,248
Gunshot.

75
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,505
Carl, get a blanket.

76
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,258
Beth, water and a towel.

77
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,719
- All right.
- Here?

78
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,014
She's not coming
in the cell blocks.

79
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Steady now.

80
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,143
All right.

81
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,437
All right.
Thank you.

82
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,940
Shh.

83
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,817
It's all right.
It's all right.

84
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,612
Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me.

85
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,116
Who are you?

86
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,993
- ( gasps )
- Hey, it's all right.

87
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,037
Hey. Look. Hey.

88
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,206
No. We're not
going to hurt you

89
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,793
unless you try something
stupid first, all right?

90
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,961
Daryl: Rick.

91
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,467
Who the hell is this?

92
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,804
You wanna tell us
your name?

93
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,600
You wanna tell us
your name?

94
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,979
Daryl:
Y'all come on in here.

95
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,899
Everything all right?

96
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,027
You're gonna
wanna see this.

97
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,572
Go ahead.
Carl, get the bag.

98
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,126
We'll keep this
safe and sound.

99
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,088
The doors are all locked.
You'll be safe here.

100
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,465
And we can treat that.

101
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,388
I didn't ask for your help.

102
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,266
Doesn't matter.

103
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,601
Can't let you leave.

104
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,046
Oh, God.

105
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,216
Thank God.
Thank God.

106
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,678
Thank God.

107
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,390
How?

108
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,726
Solitary.

109
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,644
Poor thing fought her way
into a cell.

110
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,647
Must have passed out.
Dehydrated.

111
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,414
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,629
Oh, God.

113
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,689
( birds chirping )

114
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,953
( knocks )

115
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,746
( knocks )

116
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,082
Everything all right?

117
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,586
I just came to tell you--
Mr. Coleman, he's ready.

118
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,296
Okay, I'll meet you
in the lab.

119
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,131
Yes, sir.

120
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,222
- Sorry about that.
- Andrea: No problem.

121
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,391
I'll be back.

122
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,477
Actually, I could use your help
with something now.

123
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:07,189
I said I'll be back.

124
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,192
No.
( chuckles )

125
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,654
I wish it were just that.

126
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,823
( door opens )

127
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,493
We can tend
to that wound for you,

128
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,995
give you a little
food and water,

129
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,455
and then send you
on your way.

130
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,083
But you're gonna have
to tell us how you found us

131
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,504
and why you were
carrying formula.

132
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,507
The supplies were dropped
by a young Asian guy

133
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,260
with a pretty girl.

134
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,512
Rick:
What happened?

135
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,180
Were they attacked?

136
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,517
- They were taken.
- Taken? By who?

137
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,894
By the same son of a bitch
who shot me.

138
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,396
Hey, these are our people.

139
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,231
You tell us
what happened now!

140
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,275
( grunts )
Don't you ever touch me again!

141
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,110
You'd better start talking.

142
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,864
You're gonna have a much bigger
problem than a gunshot wound.

143
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,783
Find 'em yourself.

144
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,536
Hey, shh, shh, shh.
Put it down.

145
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,882
You came here
for a reason.

146
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,266
There's a town.

147
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,310
Woodbury.

148
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,811
About 75 survivors.

149
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,813
I think they were
taken there.

150
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,398
A whole town?

151
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,193
It's run by this guy
who calls himself the Governor--

152
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:39,156
pretty boy, charming,
Jim Jones type.

153
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,158
He got muscle?

154
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,494
Paramilitary wannabes.

155
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,121
They have armed sentries
on every wall.

156
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,916
- You know a way in?
- The place is secure from walkers,

157
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,126
but we could slip
our way through.

158
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,673
How'd you know
how to get here?

159
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,175
They mentioned a prison,

160
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,635
said which direction
it was in,

161
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,261
that it was a straight shot.

162
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,265
This is Hershel,

163
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,810
the father of the girl
who was taken.

164
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,145
He'll take care of that.

165
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,192
I gotta hand it to you,

166
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,404
a lot tougher
than I remember.

167
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,990
No surprise
you lasted this long.

168
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,994
Shoot, I figured the way Officer
Friendly abandoned people,

169
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,623
he would have
left you behind by now.

170
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,918
But he didn't
do that, did he?

171
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:37,756
Hmm. So tell me,
where y'all been at?

172
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,759
It's just a matter of time
before they come looking.

173
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,096
I'll bake a cake
with pink frosting.

174
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,141
Would they like that?

175
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,893
Ain't nobody coming.

176
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,312
Rick is.

177
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,940
- And when he gets here--
- He's gonna do nothing,

178
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,110
not if he wants you
and Bo Peep back.

179
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,779
Think I'm in this by myself?

180
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,781
You can't take us all.

181
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,159
There's too many of us.

182
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,328
There ain't a pair
of nuts between

183
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,788
the whole pussy lot of you.

184
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,874
We've been on the road,

185
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,335
not hiding
in some dungeon.

186
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,840
Rick, Shane, Dale,
Jim, Andrea.

187
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,180
Really?

188
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,141
Is that right?

189
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,676
Thank you.

190
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,889
Oscar: How do you know
we can trust her?

191
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,558
Beth: This is Maggie and Glenn.
Why are we even debating?

192
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,602
Daryl:
We ain't. I'll go after them.

193
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,395
Rick: Well, this place
sounds pretty secure.

194
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,398
- You can't go alone.
- I'll go.

195
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,192
Me, too.

196
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,570
I'm in.

197
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,287
I got the flash bangs
and I got the tear gas.

198
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,414
You never know
what you're gonna need.

199
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,670
Hey.

200
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,715
Hey, don't you worry
about your old man.

201
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,884
I'm gonna keep
my eye on him.

202
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,352
- Wasn't this place overrun?
- It was.

203
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,813
And you cleared it out
all by yourselves?

204
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,648
Just the few of you?

205
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,400
There were others.

206
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,946
Carl.

207
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,922
- What you did for Mom--
- I had to.

208
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,885
Yeah, I-- I know.

209
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,597
I know, and I'm sorry.

210
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,517
No one should have
to go through that.

211
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,399
How long will you
be gone?

212
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,070
Look, if something happens
while we're gone--

213
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,947
We'll be all right.

214
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:53,327
If anything happens,
you get everyone

215
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,329
locked in the cells,
keep them all safe.

216
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,831
- I will.
- I know.

217
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,000
I know you will.

218
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,841
Take care of your sister,
all right?

219
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,305
Daryl's been calling her
Ass-Kicker.

220
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,434
Ass-Kicker?

221
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,936
Has he, now?

222
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,522
I've been thinking,
what should we really call her?

223
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,193
What do you think?

224
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,698
Remember my third grade
teacher, Mrs. Mueller?

225
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,034
Of course.

226
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:37,120
Her first name
was Judith.

227
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,997
Do you think
that's a good name?

228
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,542
I think that's--
that's a fine name.

229
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,421
Judith it is.

230
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,556
Stay safe.

231
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,142
Nine lives, remember?

232
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,232
Bring them back.

233
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,334

Mr. Coleman,

00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,278

246
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,946
I'll see you for dinner.

247
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,827
Thank you for this.

248
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,080
You're doing us
a great service.

( door opens, closes )

250
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,681
So, what exactly are you--?

251
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,184
Could you cue up the first
song on the record?

252
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,104
Sure.

253
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,277
On my mark.

My name is Milton Mamet.

258
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,432
Please raise your
right hand off the bed

259
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,519
if you recognize any of the following
statements to be true.

260
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,399
Your name
is Michael Coleman.

261
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,238
You were married
to Betty Coleman.

262
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:06,371
Your children were
Michael Jr. and Emily.

263
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,503
Very good.

264
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:25,098
( whispers indistinctly )

265
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,144
What did he say?

266
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:33,189
He asked if I could keep it
playing while we wait.

( raspy breathing )

272
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:54,794
All righty, I want you
to imagine how I felt

273
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,255
fighting my way
off that roof--

274
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,883
one hand,

275
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,135
losing blood,

276
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,263
walkers chomping down at me
every step of the way.

277
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,641
Last chance.
Where's your group?

278
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,142
All right.

279
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,103
Suit yourself.

280
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,980
You're a pretty big snack
for this fella.

281
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,899
But you know
what they say--

282
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,652
he's gonna be hungry
again in an hour.

283
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,657
Go! Run, boy!

284
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,617
( grunting )

285
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,403
( shouting )

286
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,018
( shouting )

287
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,234
( panting )

288
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,949
( music playing )

289
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,577
Milton: After Mr. Coleman passes,
we'll restrain him.

290
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:51,911
He'll reanimate.

291
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,999
I'll ask the questions again,
record his responses.

292
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,252
I need you to end the subject's
reanimated state.

293
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,131
All right.

294
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,632
I've been trying
to determine whether

295
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,427
trace memory and human
consciousness exist

296
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,263
after the subject
has transformed,

297
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,600
but I had no baseline
to work off of

298
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,602
till now.

299
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,270
Prostate cancer.

300
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,272
We didn't have
the resources to treat him,

301
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,233
so he volunteered
to be the test subject.

302
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,695
He's been very cooperative.

303
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,572
He's a remarkable man.

304
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,492
You're close?

305
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,619
We spent a lot
of time together.

306
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:35,663
The song, the singing bowl,
the questions--

307
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,583
we've done that
a few dozen times.

308
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:43,088
These are cues that
will hopefully linger

309
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,049
in his unconscious mind
even after he's died.

310
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,302
There is no
unconscious mind, Milton.

311
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,596
When they turn,
they become monsters.

312
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,348
That's all.

313
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,185
Whoever they once were
is gone.

314
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,604
We'll see.

315
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,319
You haven't seen this
before, have you?

316
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,321
The transformation.

317
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,782
No.

318
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,201
No one in your
family was--?

319
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,078
I'm an only child.

320
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,747
My parents died
when I was young.

321
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:21,084
Weren't you with anyone
when everything went down?

322
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,045
I telecommuted to work.

323
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,631

But they don't know
she's here.

334
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,935
But they do know
your brother.

335
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,770
He does.

336
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,981
But I don't know about her.
I've never seen her before.

337
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,733
Their people may come for 'em.

338
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,234
Maybe.

339
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,862
The kid and Andrea both say
they went back for me.

340
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,239
So what? He won't break,
say where his people are?

341
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,283
He's a tough son of a bitch.

342
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,784
Picked that walker
apart in minutes.

343
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,370
Maybe a winter in the sticks
put some hair on his balls.

344
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,789
We'll need him for leverage
if his people come.

345
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,291
What you try
to kill him for?

346
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,336
- He pissed me off.
- What's the girl say?

347
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,339
I was just about to go
talk to her next.

348
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,800
I'll take care of it.

349
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,725
( metal creaking )

350
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,441
( door opens )

351
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,949
May I?

352
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,661
Thank you.

353
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,417
We'll take you back
to your people,

354
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,336
explain this was all
just a misunderstanding.

355
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,633
You tell us where they are
and we'll drive you there.

356
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,178
I want to talk to Glenn.

357
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,016
I can't allow that.

358
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,727
Your people are dangerous.

359
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,021
Handcuffed my man
to a roof,

360
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,356
forced him to amputate
his own hand.

361
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,650
I don't know
anything about that.

362
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:38,323
You just tell us where they are
and we'll bring them here.

363
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,035
You'll be safe, I promise.

364
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,541
No?

365
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,710
Fine.

366
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,256
Let's try something else.

367
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,386
Stand up, please.

368
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,773
Stand up.

369
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,117
Take off your shirt.

370
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,995
No.

371
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,749
Take off your shirt

372
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,627
or I'll bring
Glenn's hand in here.

373
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,232
Go on.

374
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,264
So you gonna talk?

375
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,933
You can do whatever
you're gonna do.

376
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,060
And go to hell.

377
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:01,651
They have patrols.
We're better off on foot.

378
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,778
How far?
Night's coming.

379
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,988
It's a mile, maybe two.

380
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,157
( walker rasping )

381
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,939
I know,
what you did for me,

382
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,567
for my baby, while I was...

383
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,111
working things out--

384
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,446
thank you.

385
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,615
It's what we do.

386
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,794
- Rick.
- Down.

387
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,963
( walkers rasping )

388
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,221
Get in formation.
No gunfire.

389
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,644
Oscar.

390
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,318
There's too many of them.

391
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,490
This way.

392
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,124
Through there.
Come on.

393
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,795
Get the door.

394
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,339
( flies buzzing )

395
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,341
Rick: Keep it down.
Keep it down.

396
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,801
The smell, it's loud.

397
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,434
Oscar:
What the hell is that?

398
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,520
It's got to be a fox
or what's left of one.

399
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,609
I guess Lassie went home.

400
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,028
( pounding )

401
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,585
( whistles quietly )

402
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,021
- Ah! Who the hell are you?
- We don't mean any harm.

403
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,731
- Get outta my house!
- Okay, okay, okay.

404
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,525
We will, but we can't
right now.

405
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,068
- Now!
- Shut him up.

406
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,153
Man:
Get out right now!

407
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,072
There are walkers outside.

408
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,247
- I'll call the cops!
- I am a cop.

409
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:06,252
Now I need you
to lower the gun.

410
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,546
Don't do anything rash.

411
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,047
Everything's fine.
Let's just--

412
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,049
let's just take this
nice and slow, okay?

413
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,135
Look at me.
Hey, hey.

414
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,263
( cocks rifle )
Show me your badge.

415
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:20,558
All right. It's in my pocket.
It's in my pocket.

416
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,936
Now, I'm just gonna
reach down nice and slow.

417
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,773
Let go!
Let go of me!

418
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,358
- ( walkers rasping )
- I'll kill you, you--

419
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,776
let go of me!

420
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,278
Shut up! Shut up!

421
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,446
- ( crunches )
- Ah!

422
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,780
Help! They found me!

423
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,449
- Help me!
- Don't open that door.

424
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,367
Hel--

425
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,135
( walkers growling )

426
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,803
Remember the Alamo?

427
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,766
Daryl, help me with the door.

428
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,642
You've gotta be kidding.

429
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,479
He's dead.
Check the back.

430
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:11,984
It's clear.

431
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,153
One, two, three.

432
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:22,161
( lock clicks )

433
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,146
( sighs )

434
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,695
( rasping )

435
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,864
It's happening.

436
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,872
( ringing )

437
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,878
( music playing )

438
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,841
My name is Milton Mamet.

439
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,884
Please raise your right hand
off the bed

440
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,179
if you recognize any of the following
statements to be true.

441
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,933
Your name
is Michael Coleman.

442
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,728
You were married
to Betty Coleman.

443
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:35,025
Your children were
Michael Jr. and Emily.

444
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,069
Did you see that?
He responded.

445
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,071
The fingers move.
That could be anything.

446
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,573
No, he can't raise his hand.
It's the angle.

447
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,157
I want to try again
without the restraints.

448
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,325
No.

449
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,743
We may have tethered
his consciousness.

450
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,287
- We have to try.
- No.

451
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,872
I know what happens
if the subject comes for us.

452
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,248
That's what you're here for.

453
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,916
As soon as we pull
the restraints, he'll lunge.

454
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,255
My name is Milton Mamet.

455
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,756
Please raise your right hand--

456
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,262
( panting )

457
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,732
I think I'd like
to record my findings

458
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,775
while they're fresh.

459
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,784
Uh-uh.

460
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,795
- Hey!
- Drop it.

461
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,426
( wood clatters )

462
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,386
Governor:
We're through with games.

463
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,850
Now one of you is gonna
give up your camp.

464
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,314
( hammer clicks )

465
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,863
- The prison.
- Merle: The one near Nunez?

466
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,824
Governor:
That place is overrun.

467
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,118
We took it.

468
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,996
- How many are you?
- Maggie: 10.

469
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,500
We have 10 now.

470
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:19,630
10 people cleared
that whole prison of biters?

471
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,298
Huh?

472
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,528
Hey, hey.

473
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:45,948
Shh, shh, shh.
It's all right.

474
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,661
It's all right.

475
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,871
Shh.

476
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,040
It's all right.

477
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:07,052
( crying )

478
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,728
( door closes,
lock clicks )

479
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,229
Governor:
10 people.

480
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,731
That's deep
in the red zone.

481
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,691
- There's no way only 10--
- So she's lying?

482
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,901
'Cause if she's lying,
that means a pretty sizeable force

483
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,154
has moved into
our backyard.

484
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,822
But if she's not,

485
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,949
this group with
your brother at its core

486
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,369
has done something
you told me couldn't be done.

487
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,621
They did it.

488
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,226
Your brother might be out there
right now, searching for them.

489
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,937
Blood is blood, right?

490
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,317
Makes me wonder
where your loyalties lie.

491
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,954
Here.

492
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,584
You two get a small group
and scout this prison.

493
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,586
I want to know exactly
what we're dealing with.

494
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,254
Yeah. You got it.

495
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,808
You kept your word.

496
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,519
That you'd be back.

497
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,861
Everything all right
with Milton?

498
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,289
What happened?

499
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,209
Mr. Coleman died.

500
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,214
And did Milton find
what he was looking for?

501
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,387
No.

502
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:03,854
Hey, hey. Shh.

503
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,858
It's all right.
It's all right.

504
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,863
It's over now, huh?

505
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,573
It's all right.

506
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,668
( theme music playing )
