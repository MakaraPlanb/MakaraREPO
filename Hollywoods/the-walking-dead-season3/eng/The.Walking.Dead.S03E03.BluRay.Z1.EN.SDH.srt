1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,054
( helicopter whirring )

2
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,314
Whiskey-1-2.
Whiskey-1-2, do you copy?

3
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:29,362
Gonna 180, close the distance,
get back in contact.

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,459
- ( engine sputters )
- ( beeping )

5
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,553
Pilot:
Have faith, guys.

6
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,888
I've got us through a lot worse
than some light turbulence.

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,308
( explosion )

8
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,227
- ( beeping )
- Pilot: Hold on!

9
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,063
- Wellsey!
- Mayday, Mayday, Mayday!

10
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,569
Crash positions!

11
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,947
I'm putting her
down by the road.

12
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,783
Come on.

13
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,708
We're going in hard!

14
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,103
( moaning )

15
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,918
( theme music playing )

16
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,840
( panting )

17
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:59,095
( vomits )

18
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,348
- Don't push yourself.
- ( coughs )

19
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,893
You'd better sit.

20
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,043
I'll check it out.

21
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,254
( coughs )

22
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,345
( snarling )

23
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,103
Someone's coming.

24
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,148
- Any survivors?
- Two dead, not sure about the other.

25
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,710
Man:
Fan out.

26
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,353
Save those rounds
until you need 'em.

27
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,236
( snarling )

28
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,162
( muffled cough )

29
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,838
( snarling )

30
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,308
( grunts )

31
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,355
( growling )

32
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,898
( grunts )

33
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,362
Got a breather.
Tim!

34
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,207
Help me out here.

35
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,011
No.

36
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,857
Over here, Shumpert.

37
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,244
Drag him out.

38
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,670
He's saving them.
We should show ourselves.

39
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,381
Not yet.

40
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,303
( moaning )

41
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:13,349
( moaning )

42
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,268
( moaning )

43
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,411
( crunches )

44
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,556
( snarling )

45
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,645
( knife crunches )

46
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,400
( muffled coughing )

47
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,010
( thunder rumbles )

48
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,699
Let's roll out.

49
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,504
- ( branch snaps )
- Man: Uh-uh-uh.

50
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,507
Easy does it, girl.

51
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,968
Mine's a whole lot
bigger than yours.

52
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,429
Now put down your weapons.

53
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,685
That's it.
Nice and easy.

54
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,648
And let me see
your hands.

55
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,027
Now spin around.
That's it.

56
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,321
Nice little twirl around.

57
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,451
Oh, holy shit.

58
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,246
Blondie.

59
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,791
- Damn, you're looking good.
- ( walker snarling )

60
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,001
( thunks )

61
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,552
Now, how's about a big hug

62
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,013
for your old pal Merle?

63
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,985
Man: Have Stevens prep
the infirmary.

64
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,195
- Man #2: How many?
- Three.

65
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,073
One with multiple fractures
and severe burns.

66
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,491
Another in and out
of consciousness,

67
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,910
probably shock
and dehydration.

68
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,579
- And the third?
- She's fine.

69
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,291
- A female?
- Two.

70
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,793
Found them hiding
in the woods.

71
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,503
Bringing a homework
assignment for you,

72
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,713
so open the lab.

73
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,339
Man #2:
Do tell.

74
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,882
Man: Be at the gates
in five minutes.

75
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,092
Get off the radio.

76
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,302
Man #2:
Well, what is it?

77
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,304
Man:
Now, Milton.

78
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,865
- Michonne?
- Right here.

79
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,709
Shh.

80
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,343
Hold that.

81
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,141
Why are we being
held here?

82
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,312
- We want to leave.
- You're not well enough.

83
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,274
And it's dark.
You should stay the night.

84
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,610
Where are we?

85
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,698
That's not for me to say.

86
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,867
- He'll talk to you.
- Who?

87
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,410
( door opens )

88
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,289
Go check on
your patient, Doc.

89
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,042
Bet you was wondering
if I was real.

90
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,878
Probably hoping
I wasn't.

91
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,509
Well, here I am.

92
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,885
( chuckles )

93
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,595
I guess this old world
gets a little smaller

94
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,971
toward the end, huh?

95
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,725
Ain't so many of us left
to share the air, right?

96
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,818
You know,
when they found me,

97
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,653
I was near bled out.

98
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,447
Starving.

99
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,741
Thinking to myself a bullet

100
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,286
might make a good last meal.

101
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,748
Take myself
a nice long nap after.

102
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,334
Wait for Daryl
on the other side.

103
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,255
You seen my brother?

104
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,802
Not for a long time.

105
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,470
( chuckles )

106
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,639
Makes two of us.

107
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,267
He went back for you.

108
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,102
Him and Rick.

109
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,855
You were already gone.

110
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,815
Well...
( laughs )

111
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,942
not all of me.

112
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,947
- ( laughs )
- Oh, God.

113
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,783
Yeah, Rick.

114
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:09,163
He's that prick
that cuffed me to the rooftop.

115
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,084
Yeah.

116
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,670
He tried.

117
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,547
Daryl saw that.

118
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,843
He's always been the sweet one,
my baby brother.

119
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,763
He wanted
to keep looking,

120
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,600
but things happen.
People died.

121
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,561
A lot of them.

122
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,481
Jim, Dale,

123
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,858
Jacqui, Sophia...

124
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,738
Amy.

125
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,825
Your sister?

126
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,536
Yes.

127
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,500
She was a good kid.

128
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,630
I'm sorry to hear it.

129
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,382
There were more.
A lot more.

130
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,551
We had to leave Atlanta.

131
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,970
We wound up on a farm.

132
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,431
Daryl stepped up.

133
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:13,519
Became a valued member
of the group.

134
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,521
Now he's dead.

135
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,065
I don't know that
for sure.

136
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,817
We got run off
by a herd.

137
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,362
How long ago?

138
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,073
Seven, eight months.

139
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,202
I was separated
from the rest of them.

140
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,371
Got left behind.

141
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,253
I know what it feels like.

142
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,547
I doubt that.

143
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,968
What do you want from us?

144
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,769
Damn.

145
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,733
There she sits,

146
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,653
four walls around her,
roof over her head,

147
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,446
medicine in her veins,

148
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,491
and she wants to know
what I want from her.

149
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,623
I plucked you and your mute here
out of the dirt, blondie.

150
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,084
Saved your asses.

151
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,795
How about a thank you?

152
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,298
You had a gun on us.

153
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,216
Ooh, she speaks.

154
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,887
( laughs )

155
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:35,183
Who ain't had a gun on 'em
in the past year, huh?

156
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,518
Show of hands, y'all.

157
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,604
Anybody?

158
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,522
Hmm?

159
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,608
Shumpert, Crowley.

160
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,611
Y'all had a gun on y'all?

161
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,446
( scoffs )
Hell...

162
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,615
I think I'd piss my pants

163
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,160
if some stranger come walking up
with his mitts in his pockets.

164
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:56,038
That'd be the son of a bitch
you'd really want to be scared of.

165
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,457
Thank you.

166
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,062
( whispering )

167
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,483
Sure thing.

168
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,611
How you feeling?

169
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,030
We want our weapons.

170
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,740
Sure.

171
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,992
On our way out
the front gates.

172
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,994
Andrea:
Show us the way.

173
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,413
You've kept us locked up
in this room.

174
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,250
You see any bars
on the windows?

175
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,002
You're being cared for.

176
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,796
Under guard.

177
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,297
To protect our people.
We don't know you.

178
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,341
We know enough about you
to want out of this place.

179
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,511
We watched you drive a knife
into the skulls of two dead men.

180
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,179
What the hell was
that all about?

181
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,973
They turned.

182
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,017
They weren't bitten.

183
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,236
Doesn't matter.

184
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,032
However we die,
we all turn.

185
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,873
I put them out
of their misery.

186
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,794
It's not easy news
to swallow at first, but there it is.

187
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,797
You're not prisoners here,
you're guests.

188
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,758
If you want to leave,
as I said, you're free to do so.

189
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,719
But we don't open
the gates past dusk.

190
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,971
Draws too much attention.

191
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,766
And you especially,
you need a solid night's sleep.

192
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,853
You wouldn't last another day
out there in your condition.

193
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,064
Have you brought over
to my place in the morning.

194
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,441
Return your weapons.

195
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,151
Extra ammo,
food for the road,

196
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,319
some meds, keys to a vehicle
if you want one.

197
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,074
Send you on your way.

198
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,076
No hard feelings.

199
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,962
Welcome to Woodbury.

200
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,236
Come with me.

201
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,694
Go relieve Pete
at the back gate.

202
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,323
Take the spotlight.

203
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,245
Are you military?

204
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,997
Hardly.
Couple of vets,

205
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,667
but by and large
we're self-trained.

206
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:32,087
That's heavy artillery
they're packing.

207
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,130
Some men arrive with guns,

208
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,675
but most of the weapons
are scavenged over time.

209
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,094
And the other side of town?
The rest of the streets?

210
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,388
They're all guarded
like this?

211
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,435
It can't be.

212
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,729
It can

213
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,189
and it is.

214
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,191
( Merle whistles )

215
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,943
Got us a creeper, Governor.

216
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,072
May I?

217
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,825
Thank you.

218
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,411
Governor?
They call you that?

219
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,539
Some nicknames stick
whether you want them to or not.

220
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,876
Andrea: Buzz is a nickname.
Governor is a title.

221
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,295
There's a difference.

222
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,671
( gunshot )

223
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,172
Merle:
Got him.

224
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,300
He brought his buddies.

225
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,347
( gunshots )

226
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,186
Clear.

227
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,772
We'll get them
in the morning.

228
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,983
Can't leave them to rot.

229
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,986
Creates an odor.
Makes people uneasy.

230
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,947
What people?
There's nobody here.

231
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,824
It's a ghost town.

232
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,951
This way.

233
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,338
You'll be more
comfortable here.

234
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,424
Not the Four Seasons,
but there's a hot shower.

235
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,927
Water's limited,
so keep it short.

236
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,098
We got food, water,
fresh clothes.

237
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,558
Hope this works.

238
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,360
I know you'd feel better
with your sword,

239
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,780
more secure,
but you're safe here.

240
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,287
We appreciate it.

241
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,793
What about the pilot?
Will he make it?

242
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,711
Well, Dr. Stevens
is doing all she can.

243
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,756
Now, I know you got a lot more
questions, but I got work to do.

244
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,593
My man will be outside the door
if you need anything else.

245
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,470
I'll see you tomorrow.

246
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,527
( people chatting )

247
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:01,861
Andrea:
It's real.

248
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,489
You two were out there
for a long time.

249
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,449
While you were,
the Governor was doing this.

250
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,494
Andrea: How many people
do you have here?

251
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,329
73.

252
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,499
Eileen's about to pop,
so her kid will make it 74.

253
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,751
It's still
a work in progress,

254
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,170
but Rome wasn't
built in a day.

255
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,173
- That's a bold comparison.
- I think we've earned it.

256
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,801
Walls haven't been breached
in well over a month.

257
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,722
We haven't suffered a casualty
on the inside since early winter.

258
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,515
Andrea:
How's that possible?

259
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,892
Woman: Our Governor
set a strict curfew.

260
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,811
Nobody out after dark.

261
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,521
Noise and light are kept
to the bare minimum.

262
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,856
Armed guards on the fence

263
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,816
and patrolling the perimeter
to keep the biters away.

264
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,235
I saw what your patrols do
on the way in last night.

265
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,697
They had a dead one
strung up like an ornament.

266
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,534
I won't make excuses,

267
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,162
but those men put their lives
at risk every day

268
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,496
to protect this town.

269
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,540
They've lost more
than a few friends out there.

270
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,251
Everybody copes
in their own way.

271
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,796
But I'll raise it
with the Governor.

272
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,556
Things were orderly.

273
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,975
The fences held.

274
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,769
People were protected.

275
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,562
Food and supplies
were lasting.

276
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,815
Then one of the men
inside got bit.

277
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,068
Not sure how.

278
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,236
He went haywire.

279
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,363
Panic swept
through the camp.

280
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,366
Someone opened the gate
to escape,

281
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,411
others were bitten
and infected.

282
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,580
Those people went crazy.

283
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,374
The whole place went to hell
in a few hours.

284
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,461
My team grabbed whatever
supplies and vehicles we could

285
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,296
and abandoned our post.

286
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,465
( coughs )

287
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,102
How many of you escaped?

288
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,979
There was 10 in my group.

289
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,315
We got maybe 60 miles
from the post

290
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,442
before getting jammed up
on the highway.

291
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,612
I took the bird up in
the air to scout ahead.

292
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,324
She took a beating in the riot,
but we had no choice.

293
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,703
My guys?

294
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,166
No.

295
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,340
Let me go find the rest.

296
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,134
Bring them here
where they'll be safe.

297
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,303
They're out there
waiting for you

298
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,639
exposed.

299
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,643
Tell me where they are,
and I promise,

300
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,271
if they're still alive,

301
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,231
I'll bring 'em in.

302
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,966
Did you finish
your homework?

303
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,926
Unfortunately, the dog's
eating it already.

304
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,012
What the hell you call me?

305
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,849
Hey, where are we,
back in the school yard?

306
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,186
What, you want to take his lunch
money while you're at it?

307
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,356
Sorry, Governor.

308
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,818
Maybe I've wasted
my time with you.

309
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:31,154
Maybe you haven't learned
anything at all.

310
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,156
- He was trying to smoke in here.
- And you, I expect better.

311
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,117
Keep poking the bear
and you're bound to get mauled.

312
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,204
Remember that.
Tell me about the girl.

313
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,000
- Name's Andrea.
- You know her?

314
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,461
She from that group
in Atlanta?

315
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,004
Yeah.

316
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,423
Same one left me
on the roof,

317
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,967
forced me
to mutilate myself.

318
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,222
Does she know
your brother Daryl?

319
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,016
Yeah, she did.

320
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,897
Then talk to her again.

321
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,024
See what else
you can find out.

322
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,615
Show me something.

323
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,289
What do you make of it?

324
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,251
Oh, pretty
impressive, really.

325
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,754
Major kudos for ingenuity.

326
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,631
Take away their arms
so they can't grab you.

327
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,175
Take away their jaws
so they can't bite you.

328
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,594
Take away
their ability to eat,

329
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,514
they lose interest
in doing so.

330
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,890
They're no longer
in attack mode.

331
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,185
We can be in their presence
without threat.

332
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,689
They're-- they become
docile in a sense.

333
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,023
Lurkers.

334
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,775
Mm, docile.

335
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,112
Or lurkers.
You know, whatever you like.

336
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Why keep 'em?

337
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,782
Ah, repellent.

338
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,247
Camouflage.

339
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,626
Walk with the biters,

340
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,879
they think you're a biter.

341
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,966
Low profile.
That's smart.

342
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,303
They're still pretty thin.

343
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,139
If they're not eating,
why don't they starve?

344
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,682
They are starving.

345
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,642
They just do it slower
than we do.

346
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,396
Feels like we're trying
to impose logic on the chaos.

347
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,939
That is not a bad thing.

348
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,691
No, but what
does it buy us?

349
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,651
More questions,
more theories,

350
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,528
no answers.

351
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,197
Not yet.

352
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,242
If I could talk
to those women...

353
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,036
Merle's handling it.

354
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,122
( sighs ) I don't want to question
your judgment, Governor.

355
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,249
Sure, you do.

356
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,169
That's why I need you.

357
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,920
That and your tea.

358
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,630
Ah.

359
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,091
Well, then.

360
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,679
With all due respect,

361
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,015
letting Merle
talk to those women

362
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,142
unsupervised
is a mistake.

363
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,687
Now, you've always said
every tool kit needs a hammer,

364
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,982
but do you really feel the hammer
is the right tool for that job?

365
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,949
Eight months?

366
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,494
Hard to believe you ladies lasted
so long out there.

367
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,704
Because we're women?

368
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,873
Because you were alone.

369
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,125
We had each other.

370
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,336
Two against the world.

371
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,046
It's long odds.

372
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,839
We managed.

373
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,842
- Oh, we're impressed.
- Very.

374
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,804
Survival in the wild
is tough sledding.

375
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,223
Wake up every morning
on the ground wondering

376
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,058
if today is the day.

377
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,435
Will it be quick and final

378
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,271
or slow and, well,
without end?

379
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,149
Will someone have the good
sense to kill my brain,

380
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,360
or will I come back
as one of them?

381
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,405
Do you think
they remember anything?

382
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,323
The person they once were?

383
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,158
I don't think about it.

384
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:12,583
Milton believes there might be
a trace of the person they were

385
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,669
still trapped inside.

386
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,380
Like an echo.

387
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,341
Surely it must
have crossed your mind.

388
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,761
At one time, yeah.

389
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,888
Right before
it tried to bite me.

390
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,142
Milton:
And then you killed it?

391
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,936
I say "it" only because
no one here

392
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,397
likes to refer
to them as him...

393
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,527
or her. Ahem.

394
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:45,199
The two you had in chains,
who were they?

395
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,038
The way you
controlled them,

396
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,499
used them to your benefit.

397
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,128
You did know them,
didn't you?

398
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,882
Let them eat.

399
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,968
My apologies.

400
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,391
So what you have here,
you expect it to hold?

401
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,853
What if a herd
comes through?

402
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,646
It'll hold.

403
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,320
What's your secret?

404
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,156
Really big walls.

405
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,782
( laughs )

406
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,493
That soldier
had walls, too,

407
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,954
and we all know
how that turned out.

408
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,918
I guess we do.

409
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,673
The real secret is what goes
on within these walls.

410
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,010
It's about getting back
to who we were.

411
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,845
Who we really are.

412
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,848
They're just waiting
to be saved.

413
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,518
People here have homes,
medical care,

414
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,646
kids go to school,
adults have jobs to do.

415
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,982
There's a sense of purpose.
We're a community.

416
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,859
With a lot of guns
and ammunition.

417
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,695
- Never hurts.
- And really big walls.

418
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,990
And men willing to risk
everything to defend them.

419
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,576
Compromise our safety,

420
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,204
destroy our community,

421
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,249
I'll die before
I'll let that happen.

422
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,225
Looks like you're sitting pretty
at the end of the world.

423
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,728
Do I strike you as the kind
of man who sits pretty?

424
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,147
You reap what you sow.

425
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,899
We're the seed.

426
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,569
Now winter has passed,
it's time to harvest.

427
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,196
Time to hope?

428
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,866
We're going out there
and we're taking back what's ours.

429
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,412
Civilization.

430
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,832
We will rise again.

431
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,586
Only this time we won't
be eating each other.

432
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,687
To civilization, then.

433
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,981
( knocking )

434
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,609
Excuse me.

435
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,362
How's the tea?

436
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,534
( whispering )

437
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,583
Sorry to cut breakfast short,
but this can't wait.

438
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,627
We want our weapons.

439
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,128
Well, we can make this
meal to go

440
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,963
and your weapons
will be waiting outside,

441
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,424
but you should
take time to relax.

442
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,093
Get your strength back.

443
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,221
Have a look around.
Who knows?

444
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,515
You might like
what you see.

445
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,656
I don't trust him.

446
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,325
Why not?

447
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,288
Have you ever
trusted anybody?

448
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,582
Yeah.

449
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,669
Then give this a day or two,
that's all I'm asking.

450
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,671
Some time to get
our shit together.

451
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,048
My shit never stopped
being together.

452
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,176
Didn't look that way when Milton
asked about your walkers.

453
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,679
I'm surprised he didn't
get a fork in his eye.

454
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,347
It was none of his
damn business.

455
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,015
I guess it's none
of mine, either.

456
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,188
Seven months together,
all we've been through,

457
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,024
I still feel like
I hardly know you.

458
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,238
I'm sorry, it's the truth.
You know everything about me.

459
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,699
You know enough.

460
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,245
Those walkers were with us
all winter long,

461
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:03,541
protecting us, and you took them
out without any hesitation.

462
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,876
- That had--
- It was easier than you think.

463
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,406
( car approaching )

464
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,450
Vehicle approaching,
Corporal.

465
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,042
All right, stay alert.

466
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,220
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't shoot!

467
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,014
Identify yourself.

468
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,184
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
We found your guy.

469
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,353
Wells.
Lieutenant Wells.

470
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,190
His chopper went down.

471
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,733
Where is he?

472
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,486
We got a little settlement.
Now, he's badly hurt.

473
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,112
But he's alive.

474
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,656
The other guys didn't
make it, I'm sorry.

475
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,951
But Wells, he told me
I would find you here.

476
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,620
Wants me to bring
you to him.

477
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,622
They found Wells.
They got him. They found him.

478
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,957
We sure did.
We found you, too.

479
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,460
( grunts )

480
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,295
( gunfire )

481
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,982
( gurgling )

482
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,251
( grunts )

483
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,837
( crunches )

484
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,840
( panting )

485
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:31,272
Never waste a bullet, son.

486
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,816
Pick up the rest
of these weapons.

487
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,484
Yes, sir.

488
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,621
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

489
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,630
Go put a merciful end
to that young man's days.

490
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,725
Let's see what Uncle Sam
brought us, shall we?

491
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,300
( crowd murmuring )

492
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,959
We brought in three
new people yesterday.

493
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,797
One was a helicopter pilot
with a National Guard outfit.

494
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,135
Even though
he's clinging to life,

495
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,138
he told us about his convoy
on the highway,

496
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,849
his men.

497
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,984
I promised I'd bring
them back here alive.

498
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,823
But they didn't
have our walls

499
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,575
or our fences.

500
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,498
Biters got there
before we did.

501
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,420
Now, the men had trucks,
the trucks had weapons,

502
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,506
food, medicine,
things we need.

503
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,134
Now, we didn't know them,

504
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,636
but we'll honor
their sacrifice

505
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:10,848
by not taking what
we have here for granted.

506
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,268
Won't be long before dark,
so go on home.

507
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,396
Be thankful
for what you have.

508
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,775
Watch out
for each other.

509
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,958
You're still here.

510
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,252
Anything I can do?

511
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,504
No, nothing tonight.

512
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,341
Long day?

513
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,386
Haven't had many
short ones lately.

514
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,346
Good night.

515
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,600
So what's your real name?

516
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,144
If it's not asking
too much.

517
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,109
I never tell.

518
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,446
Never say never.

519
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,907
( chuckles )

520
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,041
Never.

521
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,851
( water bubbling )

522
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,751
( theme music playing )
