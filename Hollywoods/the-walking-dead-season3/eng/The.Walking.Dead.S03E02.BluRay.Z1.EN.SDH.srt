1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,755
( walkers snarling,
banging )

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,882
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,509
He's bleeding out.
We gotta go back.

4
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,594
Come around here.
Put pressure on the knee.

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,222
Hard, hard!
Push, push.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,848
Why don't you come on
out of there?

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,601
Slow and steady.

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,103
What happened to him?

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,771
- He got bit.
- Bit?

10
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,731
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy now.

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,025
Nobody needs
to get hurt.

12
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,568
- I need you to hold this.
- Okay.

13
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,112
- As hard as you can.
- Yes.

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,571
You have medical supplies?

15
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,281
Whoa, where do you think
you're going?

16
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,451
( walkers banging,
snarling )

17
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,912
Who the hell
are you people, anyway?

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,622
Don't look like
no rescue team.

19
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,542
If a rescue team is what
you're waiting for, don't.

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,629
Come on, we gotta go.

21
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,465
Now! Come on!
I need a hand here.

22
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,467
One, two, three, go!

23
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,970
- Holy Jesus!
- T, the door.

24
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:56,305
- Are you crazy? Don't open that!
- We got this.

25
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,267
( snarling )

26
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,272
Rick:
Daryl. Daryl!

27
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,403
Let's go.

28
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,572
Rick:
This way.

29
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,997
( theme music playing )

30
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,617
Rick:
This way, this way.

31
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,868
No, no, no.
Back, back!

32
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,536
- ( snarling )
- Daryl.

33
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,541
- Come on!
- Rick: Go, go, go.

34
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,627
Go, go, go.

35
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,521
Stop, stop.

36
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,397
Man:
Follow the flashlight.

37
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,983
Come on, let's go.

38
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,236
Go, go, go.

39
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,077
Rick: Easy, easy.

40
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,412
- He's losing too much blood.
- Open the door!

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,914
It's Hershel!

42
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,249
Carl! Come on.

43
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,750
- Oh, my God.
- Daddy!

44
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,293
Go, go, go, go, go.
In there.

45
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,546
Turn it. Turn it.
Turn around.

46
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,590
Get him on the bed.

47
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,092
Daryl:
He got bit.

48
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,593
- Oh, my God, he's gonna turn.
- Did you cut it off?

49
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,095
- Yeah.
- Maybe you got it in time.

50
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,596
- Ready?
- Okay.

51
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,099
One, two, three.
( grunts )

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,937
- One, two, three.
- Carol: Oh, God.

53
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,774
Oh!
Oh, I need bandages.

54
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,026
- We used everything we had.
- Well, get more. Anything.

55
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,778
Carl, go get the towels from
the back, right next to my bed.

56
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,280
- Is he gonna die?
- No, no, no, no.

57
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,532
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
You think you can
stabilize him?

59
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,201
I need to keep
his leg elevated.

60
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,619
Get some pillows!

61
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,288
He's already bled
through the sheets.

62
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,540
We can burn the wound
to clot the blood. I can start a fire.

63
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,542
- No, please don't do this.
- Carol: No, the shock could kill him.

64
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,460
It's not gonna stop
the arteries from bleeding.

65
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,838
We need to just keep it dressed
and let it heal on its own.

66
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,048
Oh, God.

67
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,850
( footsteps approaching )

68
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,158
That's far enough.

69
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,784
Cell block C.

70
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,953
Cell 4--
that's mine, gringo.

71
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,455
Let me in.

72
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,540
Today's your
lucky days, fellas.

73
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,126
You've been pardoned by the state
of Georgia. You're free to go.

74
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,004
- What you got going on in there?
- It ain't none of your concern.

75
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,048
Don't be telling me
what's my concern.

76
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,675
Chill, man.
Dude's leg is messed up.

77
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,011
Besides, we're free now.
Why are we still in here?

78
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,471
The man's got a point.

79
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,722
Yeah, and I gotta check
on my old lady.

80
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,016
A group of civilians
breaking in to a prison

81
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,976
you got no business being in--

82
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,187
got me thinking there ain't
no place for us to go.

83
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,357
- Why don't you go find out?
- Maybe we'll just be going now.

84
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,901
- Hey, we ain't leaving.
- You ain't coming in either.

85
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,987
Hey, this is my house, my rules.
I go where I damn well please.

86
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,115
- What was that?
- Prisoners, survivors.

87
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,285
- Glenn: What?
- It's all right. Everybody stay put.

88
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,625
Do not leave his side.

89
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,922
If he dies, you need
to be there for that.

90
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,049
You think
you can do this?

91
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,177
- Maggie will be there.
- I got it.

92
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,888
- I can bring T in here.
- I got it.

93
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,225
- Good.
- ( Daryl, prisoners arguing )

94
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,273
There ain't nothing
for you here.

95
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,067
Why don't you go back
to your own sandbox?

96
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,070
Hey, everyone relax.
There's no need for this.

97
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,405
How many of you
are in there?

98
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,741
Too many for you
to handle.

99
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,535
You guys rob a bank
or something?

100
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,328
Why don't you take him
to a hospital?

101
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,212
How long have you been
locked in that cafeteria?

102
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,592
Going on like 10 months.

103
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,262
Big Tiny:
A riot broke out.

104
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,472
Never seen
anything like it.

105
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,725
Axel:
Attica on speed, man.

106
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,560
Ever heard about
dudes going cannibal,

107
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,437
dying, coming back to life?

108
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,272
Crazy.

109
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,566
One guard looked out for us,
locked us up in the cafeteria.

110
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,652
Told us sit tight, threw me this piece,
said he'd be right back.

111
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,946
Yeah, and that
was 292 days ago.

112
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,324
- 94 according to my calcula--
- Shut up!

113
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,535
Oscar: We were thinking that
the Army or the National Guard

114
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,662
should be showing up
any day now.

115
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,914
Rick:
There is no Army.

116
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,875
What do you mean?

117
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,462
There's no government,
no hospitals, no police.

118
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,797
It's all gone.

119
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,009
For real?

120
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,969
Serious.

121
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,308
What about my moms?

122
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:36,020
My kids?
And my old lady?

123
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,648
Yo, you got a cell phone or something
that we can call our families?

124
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,358
You just don't
get it, do you?

125
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,737
No phones,
no computers.

126
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,032
As far as we can see,

127
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,117
at least half the population
has been wiped out.

128
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,828
Probably more.

129
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,505
- Ain't no way.
- See for yourself.

130
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,318
Oscar:
Damn, the sun feels good.

131
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:28,114
Axel: Good lord.
They're all dead.

132
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,117
Tomas: Never thought I'd be
so happy to see these fences.

133
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,372
Andrew:
You never said--

134
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,375
how the hell did you get
in here in the first place?

135
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,628
Cut a hole in that fence
over there by that guard tower.

136
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,589
That easy, huh?

137
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,508
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

138
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,218
Easy for you to say.

139
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,889
So what is this,
like a disease?

140
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,892
Yeah, and we're all infected.

141
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,520
Axel:
What do you mean infected?

142
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,397
Like AIDS or something?

143
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,567
Daryl: If I was to kill you,
shoot an arrow in your chest,

144
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,404
you'd come back
as one of these things.

145
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,322
It's gonna happen
to all of us.

146
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,451
Tomas: Ain't no way
these Robin Hood cats

147
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,579
responsible for killing
all these freaks.

148
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,914
Must be 50 bodies
out here.

149
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,419
Where'd you come from?

150
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,504
Atlanta.

151
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,800
Where are you headed?

152
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,094
For now, nowhere.

153
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,769
I guess you can take that area
down there near the water.

154
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,022
Should be comfortable.

155
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,940
We're using
that field for crops.

156
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,943
- We'll help you move your gear out.
- Rick: That won't be necessary.

157
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,779
We took out these walkers.
This prison is ours.

158
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,281
Slow down, cowboy.

159
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,618
You snatched the locks
off our doors.

160
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,870
We'll give you new locks,
if that's how you want it.

161
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,789
This is our prison.
We were here first.

162
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,959
Locked in a broom closet?

163
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,836
We took it, set you free.

164
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,838
It's ours.
We spilled blood.

165
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,757
We're moving back
into our cell block.

166
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,175
You'll have to get your own.

167
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,885
It is mine. I've still got personal
artifacts in there.

168
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,137
- That's about as mine as it gets.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

169
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,724
Maybe let's try to make this
work out so everybody wins.

170
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:23,229
- I don't see that happening.
- Neither do I.

171
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,941
I ain't going back in that cafeteria
for one more minute.

172
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,984
There are other
cell blocks.

173
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,195
You could leave.

174
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,155
Try your luck
out on the road.

175
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,750
If these three pussies
can do all this,

176
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,044
the least we can do
is take out another cell block.

177
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,421
With what?

178
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,382
Atlanta here will spot us
some real weapons.

179
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,301
Won't you, boss?

180
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,845
How stocked
is that cafeteria?

181
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,180
It must have
plenty of food.

182
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,516
Five guys lasting
almost a year?

183
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,686
It sure as hell don't
look like anybody's been starving.

184
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,523
- There's only a little left.
- We'll take half.

185
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,693
In exchange, we'll help
clear out a cell block.

186
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,654
Didn't you hear him?
There's only a little left.

187
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,991
Bet you got more food
than you got choices.

188
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,619
You pay, we'll play.

189
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,622
We'll clear out a block for you,
then you keep to it.

190
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,584
All right.

191
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,087
But let's be clear--

192
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,382
if we see you out here
anywhere near our people,

193
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,551
if I so much as even catch
a whiff of your scent,

194
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,845
I will kill you.

195
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,559
Deal.

196
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,606
It has to stop
eventually, right?

197
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,026
It slowed down
quite a bit already.

198
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,948
If we can get him
through this--

199
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,367
When we get him
through this.

200
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,078
--we'll need crutches.

201
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,247
Right now we could use
some antibiotics

202
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,917
and painkillers,
some sterile gauze.

203
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,669
There's got to be
an infirmary here.

204
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,963
If there is,
we'll find it.

205
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,633
You've gotta be worried sick
about delivering the baby.

206
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,220
Look at me.
Do I look worried?

207
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,099
You look disgusting.

208
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,518
( laughs )
So do you.

209
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,482
We'll get through this.

210
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,277
Pantry's back here.

211
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,116
You never tried
to break out of here?

212
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,619
Yeah, we tried to take
the doors off.

213
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,371
But if you make
one peep in here,

214
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,247
then those freaks'll be
lined up outside the door

215
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,458
growling,
trying to get in.

216
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,378
Windows got bars on there
that He-Man couldn't get through.

217
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,754
Bigger than a 5x8.

218
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,130
Big Tiny:
You won't find me complaining.

219
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,550
Doing 15. My left leg can barely fit
on one of those bunks.

220
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,345
Oscar: Yeah, they don't call him
Big Tiny for nothing.

221
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,222
You done jerking
each other off?

222
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,474
Sick of waiting
back here.

223
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,293
This what you call
a little bit of food?

224
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,838
- Goes fast.
- Mm-hmm.

225
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,424
You can have a bag of corn,
some tuna fish--

226
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,343
We said half.
That's the deal.

227
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,388
- What's in there?
- Oscar: Don't open that.

228
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,349
- ( coughing, gagging )
- ( laughing )

229
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,017
He wanted to know.

230
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,483
Can't wait for
my own pot to piss in.

231
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,612
( wheezing )

232
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,541
It was stupid of us
to let him go.

233
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,463
We cleared this whole cell block,
just the five of us.

234
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,048
It could have
happened to anyone.

235
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,637
What are we gonna
do without him?

236
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,932
Hey, stop it.

237
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,685
- All right? Stop it.
- ( sighs )

238
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,938
He's still here.

239
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,858
What if he does wake up?

240
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,862
Then what?
He can't even walk.

241
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,864
All we do is run.

242
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,908
Hey...

243
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,077
this won't break him.

244
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,579
Okay?

245
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,248
He's got you and Beth.

246
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,085
Am I the only person
living in reality here?

247
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,049
We've been through
so much already.

248
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,718
You're expecting it, too.

249
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,263
I'm not expecting,
all right?

250
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,350
I'm just preparing.

251
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,851
Why don't you go
check on Beth?

252
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,020
Go on.
I'll watch him.

253
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,441
( sighs )

254
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,166
What are you doing?

255
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,543
He's gonna have a hard time
walking around

256
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,046
with one side of his pants
dragging on the ground.

257
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,257
You know, he could
trip or something.

258
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,055
There's a good chance
he won't wake up.

259
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,765
Why are you so eager
to give up on him?

260
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,308
I'm not giving up on him.

261
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,144
It sure sounds like it.

262
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,274
I don't want you to get
your hopes too high.

263
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,943
We're not equipped to deal
with something like this.

264
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,656
- We have Carol.
- She's not a doctor.

265
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,200
Dad taught her a few things
to help with the baby.

266
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,202
She stopped
the bleeding.

267
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,043
These'll do just fine.

268
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,549
- T-Dog: Food's here.
- What you got?

269
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:29,928
Canned beef, canned corn,
canned cans.

270
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,347
There's a lot more
where this came from.

271
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,849
Any change?

272
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,727
Bleeding is under control
and no fever,

273
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,980
but his breath is labored
and his pulse is way down

274
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,899
and he hasn't opened
his eyes yet.

275
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,819
Take my cuffs,
put them on him.

276
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,322
I'm not taking
any chances.

277
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,120
Yeah.

278
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,581
So what about
those prisoners?

279
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,374
( sighs )
We're gonna help them

280
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,959
clear out their
own cell block,

281
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,629
and then they'll be there
and we'll be here.

282
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,548
- Living beside each other.
- I'm not giving up this prison.

283
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,009
Do they have guns?

284
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,304
I only saw one.

285
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:17,184
Yeah, I don't know
if it's gonna work.

286
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,811
Well, what are your options?

287
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,692
Kill them.

288
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,196
If that's what
you think is best.

289
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,866
You s--
you say this now...

290
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,453
Look, I know that
I'm a shitty wife

291
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,414
and I'm not winning
any Mother of the Year awards,

292
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,462
but I need you
to know that...

293
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,843
not for one second do I think
there is malice in your heart.

294
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,180
You're not a killer,
and I know that.

295
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,267
I know that, so--

296
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,273
so do whatever you gotta do
to keep this group safe.

297
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,359
And do it with
a clear conscience.

298
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:27,379
Why do I need this
when I got this?

299
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,297
Daryl:
You don't fire guns,

300
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,967
not unless your back's
up against a wall.

301
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,593
Noise attracts them.

302
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,138
It really riles them up.

303
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,308
We'll go in two by two.
Daryl will run point with T.

304
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,519
I'll bring up
the rear with you.

305
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,688
Stay tight,
hold formation

306
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,898
no matter how close
the walkers get.

307
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,859
Anyone breaks ranks,
we could all go down.

308
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,610
Anyone runs off,

309
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,821
they could get mistaken
for a walker,

310
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,823
end up with an axe
to the head.

311
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,450
And that's
where you aim.

312
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,493
These things only go down
with a head shot.

313
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,496
You ain't gotta tell us
how to take out a man.

314
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,333
They ain't men.
They're something else.

315
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,462
Just remember to go
for the brain.

316
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,008
( keys jangle )

317
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,931
What's going on?

318
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,977
- We had to.
- It's just a precaution.

319
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,777
You think maybe I could have
a minute alone here?

320
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,820
Yeah, you want me to--?

321
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,824
No, just by myself.

322
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,076
Carol:
Of course.

323
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,874
I'll be right outside.

324
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,989
Dad...

325
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,662
you don't have
to fight anymore.

326
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,254
If you're worried
about me and Beth, don't.

327
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,589
Don't worry about us.

328
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,969
We'll take care of each other.
We'll look out.

329
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,763
Me, Beth, and Glenn
will look out.

330
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,689
Go ahead, Dad.
It's okay.

331
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,194
Be peaceful.

332
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,283
You don't have to fight.

333
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,332
If it's time to go,
it's okay.

334
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,301
Daddy, I just want
to thank you.

335
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,140
For everything,
thank you.

336
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,150
( kisses )

337
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,348
Man, it's too
damn dark in here.

338
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,391
Gotta hold it up high
out in front of you.

339
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,269
You're gonna hear them
before you see them.

340
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,446
- It's coming!
- Rick: Shh!

341
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,451
( snarling )

342
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,547
( yelling )

343
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,436
You wanna taste me?

344
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,924
( door creaks, clangs )

345
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,680
I thought you were
organizing the food.

346
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,934
Even better.

347
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,438
Check it out.

348
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,940
- ( gasps )
- Where did you get this?

349
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,859
Found the infirmary.

350
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,028
Wasn't much left,
but I cleared it out.

351
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,405
- You went by yourself?
- Yeah.

352
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:46,990
Are you crazy?

353
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,534
No big deal.
I killed two walkers.

354
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,079
You-- all right,
do you see this?

355
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,165
This was with
the whole group.

356
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,958
We needed supplies,
so I got them.

357
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,793
- I appreciate that, but--
- Then get off my back.

358
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,962
Carl!

359
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,965
She's your mother.
You can't talk to her like that.

360
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,386
Listen, I think it's great
that you wanna help--

361
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,730
It's gotta be the brain.

362
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,317
Not the stomach,
not the heart-- the brain.

363
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:26,404
I hear you.
The brain.

364
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,573
- Like that?
- Uh-huh.

365
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,374
Stay in tight formation.
No more prison riot crap.

366
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,822
Tomas:
Get him!

367
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,868
( snarling )

368
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,338
Ah!

369
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:51,406
These bandages will help
prevent infection.

370
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:52,907
It's good.

371
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,994
It's good that he taught you
all this stuff.

372
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,746
He didn't teach me
everything.

373
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,378
I need your help
with something.

374
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,422
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

375
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,425
- What is it?
- Not here.

376
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,760
I can't leave Hershel.

377
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,096
- This is important.
- Carol, I can't--

378
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,098
- Go on. We got it.
- Glenn: No way.

379
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,434
- We'll be fine.
- We're not gonna be gone long.

380
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,270
- Rick said for me--
- We're fine.

381
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,236
All right.

382
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,205
I'm telling you, I don't feel anything.
It's just a scratch.

383
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,040
- I'm sorry, man.
- I can keep fighting!

384
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,292
You cut that old guy's leg
off to save his life.

385
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,586
- Look at where the bite is.
- Guys, I'm fine!

386
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,672
Just-- I'm fine.

387
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,300
Look at me-- I'm not changing
into one of those things.

388
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,177
Oscar: Look, man, there has to be
something we can do.

389
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,304
- We could just lock him up.
- Quarantine him.

390
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,973
We gotta do something.
Why you just standing there?

391
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,142
- We gotta save him.
- There's nothing we can do.

392
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,144
You son of a bitch.

393
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,980
I'm all ri--

394
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,814
( walkers snarling )

395
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,197
Carol:
That one.

396
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,706
Everything you're saying
is completely sane.

397
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:09,252
You're wanting to use a walker
for practice is a sane thing.

398
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,962
I mean it, okay.

399
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,507
I'm just-- I'm just trying
to wrap my mind around it.

400
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,427
Carol:
Lori's overdue.

401
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,345
She had Carl by C-section.

402
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,889
She's probably gonna have
to have this one the same way.

403
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,392
Hershel had a little bit of
experience with this kind of thing,

404
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,561
but he's not gonna
be able to do it anymore.

405
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,062
I need experience

406
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,606
and we have
plenty of cadavers.

407
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:36,195
All right, well, like I said,
it's completely sane.

408
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,032
I need to learn
how to cut through

409
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,159
the abdomen and the uterus
without cutting the baby.

410
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,411
Why not?

411
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,415
I'll do it.

412
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,044
Okay.

413
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,598
Come on.

414
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:06,768
Hey, follow me.
Come on.

415
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,229
Right here, come on.

416
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,731
Follow me.
That's right.

417
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,649
There we go.
Come on!

418
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,628
You see the look
on his face?

419
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:37,799
He makes one move,
just give me a signal.

420
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,528
( walkers snarling )

421
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,916
- I ain't opening that.
- Yes, you are.

422
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,668
If you want
this cell block,

423
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,670
you're gonna open
that door.

424
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,840
Just the one,
not both of them.

425
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,551
Because we need
to control this.

426
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,531
You bitches ready?

427
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,955
I got this.

428
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,710
- I said one door!
- Shit happens.

429
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,112
T, mind the gap.

430
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:40,880
- It was coming at me, bro.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.

431
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,757
I get it.

432
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,302
Shit happens.

433
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,395
No!

434
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,609
Ah!

435
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,110
Easy, now.

436
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,615
I got him.

437
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,285
Man, get down
on your knees.

438
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,998
We don't have no affiliation
to what just happened.

439
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,500
Tell him, Oscar.

440
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:20,336
Stop talking, man.

441
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,694
( door opens )

442
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,713
Let me back in, man.
Let me back in!

443
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,881
Open it up, man!
Open up!

444
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,384
- Open up.
- You'd better run.

445
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,515
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( Andrew screaming )

446
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,020
( screaming continues )

447
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,107
( screaming stops )

448
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,409
( snoring softly )

449
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,056
( breathing stops )

450
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,862
What's happening?

451
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,952
Do something!

452
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,247
Somebody help!
Somebody!

453
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,917
Please help!

454
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,601
Come on.

455
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,229
Come on.

456
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,148
Come on.

457
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,447
- ( Hershel gasps )
- No!

458
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,283
- Lori--
- ( gasping )

459
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,789
( snoring softly )

460
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,635
We didn't have nothing
to do with that.

461
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,972
You didn't know? You knew.
Daryl, let's end this now.

462
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,141
Sir, please!
Please, listen to me!

463
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,934
It was them that was bad.
It wasn't us.

464
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,937
- Oh, that's convenient.
- You saw what he did to Tiny.

465
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,314
He was my friend.

466
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,443
Please, we ain't like that.

467
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,487
I like my pharmaceuticals,
but I'm no killer.

468
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,406
Oscar here,
he's a B and E,

469
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,491
and he ain't very good
at it neither.

470
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,077
We ain't the violent kind,
they were!

471
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:44,498
Please, I swear to God!
I wanna live!

472
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,180
What about you?

473
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:03,184
I ain't never pleaded
for my life.

474
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,729
And I ain't about
to start now.

475
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,023
So you do
what you gotta do.

476
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,122
Oh, man.

477
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,840
Axel:
I knew these guys.

478
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,968
These were good men.

479
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,890
Let's go.

480
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,059
Oscar: So you're just gonna
leave us in here?

481
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,895
- Man, this is sick.
- We're locking down this cell block.

482
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,523
From now on, this part
of the prison is yours.

483
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,567
Take it or leave it.
That was the deal.

484
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,446
You think this is sick?

485
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,323
You don't wanna know
what's outside.

486
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,620
Consider yourselves
the lucky ones.

487
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,914
Sorry about
your friends, man.

488
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,713
A word of advice--

489
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,719
take those bodies outside
and burn them.

490
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,147
( door clangs )

491
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,325
( footsteps )

492
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,828
Hershel stopped
breathing.

493
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:49,290
- Mom saved him.
- It's true.

494
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,590
Still no fever.

495
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,857
Daddy?

496
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,445
Daddy.

497
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,532
( Beth laughs )

498
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,451
Daddy.

499
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,533
( Beth crying )

500
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,632
Come here.

501
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,969
( rustling )

502
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,524
( breathing )

503
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,631
We'll start cleaning
tomorrow.

504
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:30,594
Yeah. Yeah, we'll give
Carl a safe place to...

505
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,931
do whatever he does
these days.

506
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,437
For the record, I-- I don't
think you're a bad mother.

507
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,193
Well, wife
is a different story.

508
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,908
For better or worse, right?

509
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,703
I mean, what are
we gonna do-- hire lawyers

510
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,873
and get divorced
and split our assets?

511
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,712
We got food. Hershel's alive.
Today was a good day.

512
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,135
He'd be dead
if it weren't for you.

513
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,970
You're the one
that acted fast.

514
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:16,223
If you hadn't done
what you did, then...

515
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:29,278
I thought maybe you were coming
out here to talk about us.

516
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,827
Maybe there's nothing
to talk about anymore.

517
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,723
We're awful grateful
for what you did.

518
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,126
( theme music playing )
