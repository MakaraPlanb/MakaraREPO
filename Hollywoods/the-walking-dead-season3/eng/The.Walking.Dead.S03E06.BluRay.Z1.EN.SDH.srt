1
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,056
( crow cawing )

2
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,308
What the hell
is this mess?

3
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,477
She did this.

4
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,229
It means something,

5
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:23,523
the way it's all
set up like that.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,360
The Governor was right
to send us out.

7
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,153
Damn straight, Tim.

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,907
We're doing a righteous
public service here.

9
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,076
Go back.

10
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,744
What?

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,456
Neil:
The arms are a G.

12
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,375
The legs make an O.

13
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,293
And that's a back.
It says, "Go back."

14
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,048
( laughing )

15
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,717
This is too good.

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,261
Look at this.

17
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,722
She sent us
a biter-gram, y'all.

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,223
( laughs )

19
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,226
I don't believe
this is happening.

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,273
Hey, hey!
You knock it off.

21
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,817
What the hell's
wrong with you?

22
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,027
Now, the Governor
chose you

23
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,530
'cause he thought
you were ready.

24
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,408
I want you to succeed.
I do.

25
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,869
But if you keep
announcing to the world

26
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,746
that you're pissing
your pants,

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,290
I'm gonna have to
smash your teeth in.

28
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,838
Now how do you say
your last name?

29
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,506
Gargulio.

30
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,927
Well, I'm gonna keep
calling you Neil.

31
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,847
All right?

32
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,099
( rustling )

33
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,606
What's the deal,
Michonne? Hmm?

34
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:50,026
You gonna leap out of the woods,
one against four,

35
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,736
all of us armed
to the teeth

36
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:55,239
and you with just
your little pig-sticker?

37
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,575
No, no, no, Michonne.

38
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,587
( growls )

39
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,439
We having fun yet?!

40
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,608
( theme music playing )

41
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,355
Woman on phone: Hello?
Is-- is someone there?

42
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,691
Rick: Yes. Yes.
Who is--?

43
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,192
Woman:
Oh, my God!

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,819
I can't believe
someone picked up.

45
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,697
We've been calling since--
since it all started.

46
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,198
Rick:
Where are you?

47
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,033
Woman:
I can't say.

48
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,160
Rick: You could be
1,000 miles away.

49
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,496
Woman: I'm not going to say
where we are.

50
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,498
Rick:
Are you--

51
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,750
are you someplace safe?

52
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,544
Woman:
Yeah.

53
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,547
And part of it
is because we're careful.

54
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,507
I can't tell you
where we are.

55
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,092
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,387
What ma-- what makes
your place so safe?

57
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,389
It's just...

58
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,433
away...

59
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,560
from them.

60
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,232
I have a son.

61
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:02,408
I-- I have a newborn baby.

62
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,536
I'm with a good group
of people.

63
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,413
Would you be willing--

64
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,459
could you take in others?

65
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,921
We can pull our weight.
We can help you.

66
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,756
I'd have to talk
to the group.

67
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,674
Well, put them on.
Let me make a case.

68
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,176
Let me talk to them first.

69
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,761
Please, please,
don't-- don't go.

70
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,765
Just-- please,
we're good people here.

71
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,559
We just need some help
and we can help you.

72
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,895
- I'll call back in two hours.
- Please!

73
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,522
You don't understand.
You don't know.

74
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,194
We're dying.

75
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,782
- We're dying here.
- ( clicks )

76
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,508
Rick:
Everybody okay?

77
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,677
Yeah, we are.

78
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,435
What about you?

79
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,146
I cleared out
the boiler block.

80
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,607
How many were there?

81
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,485
I don't know.
A dozen, two dozen.

82
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,364
I have to get back.
Just wanted to check on Carl.

83
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,491
Rick, we can handle
taking out the bodies.

84
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,827
- You don't have to.
- No, I do.

85
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,622
Everyone have a gun
and a knife?

86
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,709
Yeah. We're running
low on ammo, though.

87
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,086
Maggie and me were planning
on making a run this afternoon.

88
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,171
Found a phone book
with some places we can hit,

89
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,715
look for bullets and formula.

90
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,508
We cleared out
the generator room.

91
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,510
Axel's there trying to fix it

92
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,220
in case of emergency.

93
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,639
We're gonna sweep
the lower levels as well.

94
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,183
Good. Good.

95
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,353
Rick.

96
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,191
( whimpering )

97
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,445
Let's go. She's hit.

98
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,447
Slowed her down.

99
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,783
- Tim and Crowley, they--
- We're close to the red zone.

100
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,745
Them shots just pulled
every biter in this area our way.

101
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,581
- Let's go. Get up.
- ( hyperventilating )

102
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,583
Neil!

103
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,084
( grunts )

104
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,295
Now you're gonna rise
to the occasion, son.

105
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,338
Some serious shit's
going down.

106
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,549
I need you here.
You read me, amigo?

107
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,510
- I don't want you to die.
- Yes. Yes.

108
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,596
Get up.

109
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:33,017
Now you know we don't ever
let our own turn.

110
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,643
Never.

111
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,900
Come on.

112
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,526
Just do it.

113
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,698
Atta boy.

114
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,700
Come on,
let's get going.

115
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,495
She ain't running,
she's hunting.

116
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,581
So are we.
There we go.

117
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,793
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,
catch a biter by the toe.

118
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,294
My mother said to pick...

119
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,213
Governor:
You know you can join in.

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,423
They don't bite.

121
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,803
That's kind of the whole idea
of the place.

122
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,429
Seems like you also
encourage people

123
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,932
to punch each other
in the face.

124
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,101
The arena.

125
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,977
You didn't like
that much, huh?

126
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,107
No, not so much,
but I get it.

127
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,110
Listen, I want to
ask you something.

128
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,070
No.

129
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,364
Okay.

130
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,117
Hold on.
How do you get it?

131
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,077
I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your town.

132
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,578
This is our town.
You stayed.

133
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,123
You're part of this now,
so tell me.

134
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,083
( sighs )

135
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,464
If it's an escape,
I don't think it's the right one.

136
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,133
It's brutality for fun,

137
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,886
and I think the world's
brutal enough already.

138
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,057
It really
bothered you, huh?

139
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,059
But I do want to be here.

140
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,686
So what were you saying

141
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,647
before I made you condemn
our sadistic way of life?

142
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,067
I want to contribute.
Everyone else does.

143
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,735
Well, Robbie could use
some help in food distr--

144
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,154
I want to work the wall.

145
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,656
I'm a good shot.
I want to stay that way.

146
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,199
Can you use a bow?

147
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,826
I can learn.

148
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,120
Well, I can get
somebody to teach you.

149
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,427
( sighs )

150
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,346
- ( phone rings )
- Hello?

151
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,056
Hello?

152
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,350
Man: You the guy
she was talking to?

153
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,855
Yes.

154
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,773
And you want to come
where we are?

155
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,194
- She said it was safe.
- It is.

156
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,864
No attacks,
no one's been bit,

157
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,617
no one's died,

158
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,703
no one's turned,
no one's gone crazy.

159
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,957
Yes, we want to come
where you are.

160
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,501
You could be dangerous.

161
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,670
Have you killed anyone?

162
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,929
Yes, people who threatened me
or threatened my group.

163
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,725
How many people
have you killed?

164
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,772
Four.

165
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,400
Two outsiders who tried
to draw on me.

166
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,069
One threw me to walkers.

167
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:34,073
The other one,
he was one of our own.

168
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,200
He lost it.

169
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,202
Lost what?

170
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,537
Who he was.

171
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,415
He threatened me.

172
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,253
He tried to kill me,
so I killed him.

173
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,505
How did you lose
your wife?

174
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,591
How do you know
I had a wife?

175
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,303
You have a boy
and a baby.

176
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,764
Tell me how you lost
your wife.

177
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,526
I don't want to talk
about that.

178
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,115
- ( clicks )
- Hello?

179
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,118
Hello?
No!

180
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,871
No!

181
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,925
Andrea:
Thanks for doing this.

182
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,136
When the Gov asks me
to do something, I do it.

183
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,637
I figure we can
start tomorrow.

184
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,848
There's a training area,
some hay bales.

185
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,474
There's even a bow
you can use.

186
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,976
It was my old one.

187
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,395
You must be pretty good.

188
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,150
Yeah.
My dad taught me.

189
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,651
He used to
take me hunting.

190
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,361
He wanted me to be
in the Olympics.

191
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,155
This one was his.

192
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,240
I mean, it's worth
more than my car.

193
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,910
It's... awesome.

194
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,496
So I totally
killed him for it.

195
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,169
That wasn't why
you killed him.

196
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,379
No.

197
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,382
My dad wasn't himself.
My brother wasn't either.

198
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,263
I had to kill my sister.

199
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,186
Sucks, right?

200
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,980
Yeah.

201
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,862
- ( growling )
- Walker.

202
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,990
Cool.
Watch this.

203
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,215
- I got it.
- I can do it.

204
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,883
We're not supposed
to go over the wall.

205
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,600
( grunts )

206
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,733
What the hell was that?

207
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,319
That is how it's done.

208
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,071
I said I could do it.

209
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,031
What is wrong with you?

210
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,200
This isn't a game.

211
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,540
( clanking )

212
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,918
( door closes )

213
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,148
May I?

214
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,048
Still feel it.

215
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,678
I'm wiggling
my toes right now.

216
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,306
( chuckles )

217
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,683
I'm a ghost
from the knee down.

218
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,895
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,647
You saved my life, Rick.

220
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,617
She was sorry for
the things that happened.

221
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,870
She told me that.

222
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,415
She planned
on telling you.

223
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,960
Take your time,
whatever you need.

224
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,879
You carried us.

225
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,215
You didn't let us give up.
You got us here.

226
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,634
It's not enough.
It's not safe enough.

227
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,470
There isn't anywhere else.

228
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,473
I know you want
to get away from this,

229
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,100
but we've run already.

230
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,523
I got a call.

231
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,857
What?

232
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,692
Someone called.

233
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,946
On this phone.

234
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,948
A woman.

235
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,367
She was young.
She was part of a group.

236
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,703
She said they had
a safe place.

237
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,878
They said they were just dialing
numbers and I picked up.

238
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,050
She said they'd
be calling back.

239
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,554
If it sounds right, I want to talk
them into taking us in.

240
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,056
Did she say
where they were?

241
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,350
No, but it doesn't matter.

242
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,104
If it's safe, we'll get there.

243
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,898
Don't tell the rest
of the group, not yet.

244
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,574
I'll sit here with you.

245
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,702
That's something
I'm pretty good at nowadays.

246
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,537
No.

247
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,421
All right.

248
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,572
( rustling )

249
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,282
Move!

250
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,288
( groans )

251
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,249
( groans )

252
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,127
- Ah!
- ( Michonne coughing )

253
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,176
( growling )

254
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,272
( coughing )

255
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,985
( groans )

256
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,573
( squelches )

257
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,844
( metal clanking )

258
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,307
Check it out, man.

259
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,476
Must have missed it
last night.

260
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,106
It's probably just
one or two of 'em.

261
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,483
Don't look
they got much fight.

262
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,700
They ain't going nowhere.

263
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,160
We'll take care of it
on the way back.

264
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,914
( whistles )

265
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,041
Come on.

266
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,924
You know, my mom,
she liked her wine.

267
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,262
She liked to
smoke in bed.

268
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,764
Virginia Slims.

269
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,729
I was playing out with the kids
in the neighborhood.

270
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,691
I could do that
with Merle gone.

271
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,280
They had bikes, I didn't.

272
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,284
We heard sirens
getting louder.

273
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,539
They jumped on their bikes,
ran after it,

274
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,834
you know, hoping to see
something worth seeing.

275
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,174
I ran after them,
but I couldn't keep up.

276
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,179
I ran around a corner

277
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,891
and saw my friends
looking at me.

278
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,393
Hell, I saw everybody
looking at me.

279
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,814
Fire trucks everywhere.

280
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,109
People from
the neighborhood.

281
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,654
It was my house
they were there for.

282
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,991
It was my mom in bed

283
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,285
burnt down to nothing.

284
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,706
That was the hard part.

285
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,376
You know,
she was just gone.

286
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,129
Erased.

287
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,632
Nothing left of her.

288
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,304
People said it was
better that way.

289
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,474
( chuckles )
I don't know.

290
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,310
Just made it seem
like it wasn't real, you know?

291
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,941
I shot my mom.

292
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,487
She was out.

293
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,656
Hadn't turned yet.

294
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,036
I ended it.

295
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,205
It was real.

296
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,335
Sorry about your mom.

297
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,132
I'm sorry about yours.

298
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,513
Come on.

299
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,476
( knocks )

300
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,023
Come in.

301
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,241
I know why
you want to see me.

302
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,953
You were told we don't
go over unless we have to.

303
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,289
I just...

304
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,708
I wanted
a little practice.

305
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,376
Fair enough.

306
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,380
We don't need you
on the wall.

307
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,594
Okay.

308
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,641
I liked the fights.

309
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:36,234
I didn't like
that I liked them.

310
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,778
But you did.
I know.

311
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,783
What?

312
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,243
How?

313
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,205
Could have walked out.
You started walking out.

314
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,210
But you stayed.

315
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,088
Just like you stayed
right now to tell me that.

316
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,633
( chuckles )

317
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,802
Are you saying
that I like you, too?

318
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,097
I think
I'm growing on you.

319
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,853
You rose
to the occasion, kid.

320
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,731
When we get back,
I'm gonna get you a beer.

321
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,441
Come on, she can't have
made it that far.

322
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,777
No, no, no, no.
We're done.

323
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,279
We're gonna grab a car,
haul ass home.

324
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,781
It's been
a good day's work.

325
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:26,076
But she-- she killed
Tim and Crowley.

326
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,829
Yep, but we messed
her up pretty bad.

327
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,832
Anyway, she's headed
straight for the red zone.

328
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,794
She's as good as dead.

329
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,462
What do we tell
the Governor?

330
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,089
What the hell you think
we tell him?

331
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,507
Tell him we killed her.

332
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,550
Like I said, man,
she's as good as dead.

333
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,303
I'm gonna keep going.

334
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,555
She ain't right
in the head.

335
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,432
She's gonna die.

336
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,226
Ain't worth our time.

337
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,186
Definitely ain't
worth our blood.

338
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,854
Now let's go.

339
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,816
This is some serious shit.
That's what you said.

340
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,113
I'm not gonna lie
to the Governor about it.

341
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,118
You're right.

342
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,286
Can't cut corners
on this one.

343
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,749
You've come along
pretty quick there, kid.

344
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,504
How do you say
your name again?

345
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,840
Gargulio.

346
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,137
- Gargulio.
- ( bird squawks )

347
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,055
Hear that bird?

348
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,141
( gunshot )

349
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,025
Gargulio.

350
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,871
( walkers growling )

351
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,311
( phone rings )

352
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,021
Hello?

353
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,524
Woman: You didn't want to tell
him how your wife died?

354
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,527
No, I just lost her.
But if that's what it takes--

355
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,404
Woman:
It'd be good.

356
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,198
You should talk
about it, Rick.

357
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,075
That sounds--

358
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,370
how--

359
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,919
how do you know my name?

360
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,422
( clicks )

361
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,792
( car approaching )

362
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,820
Clear outside.

363
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,406
All right,
let's take a look.

364
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,658
Hey.

365
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,836
It's a beautiful day.

366
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,653
- ( wings flapping )
- ( gasps )

367
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,746
Glenn, get that duck.

368
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,040
- What?
- Get that duck.

369
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,459
- ( laughs ) Are you serious?
- Yeah.

370
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,420
A kid growing up in a prison
could use some toys.

371
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:52,967
You were the kind of guy who waxed
his car every weekend, right?

372
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,346
No, I wasn't particularly
proud of my car

373
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:01,100
or my house or my job.

374
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,853
My dog was a wonder
of stupidity.

375
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,314
Lost a fight
with a tree once.

376
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,901
You did this.

377
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,071
I find it hard to believe that you
didn't have a single thing

378
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,573
that you were
proud of before.

379
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,619
I didn't say that.

380
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,414
I had something.

381
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,339
So how long has it been?

382
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,301
Uh, since--

383
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,887
since you had
whiskey this good?

384
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,100
So long,
I can't remember.

385
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,353
Well, I'm happy
to forget a lot.

386
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,398
Not just the bad stuff.

387
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,566
Even the good times?

388
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,445
I want to be here

389
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,447
right now.

390
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:01,494
This glass in my hand,
leaves in the breeze,

391
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,454
talking to you.

392
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,373
I feel special.

393
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,125
An audience
with the Governor.

394
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,835
Ugh.

395
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,004
Let's just go with Philip, huh?
I'm off the clock.

396
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,006
Oh, Philip.
That's better.

397
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,758
Makes me feel less
like a lobbyist.

398
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:20,471
You don't have to be ashamed
about liking the fight.

399
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,557
Or fighting the fight.

400
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,478
I love it.

401
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,316
It's not the only thing,
but nowadays,

402
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,902
it's part of being alive.

403
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,655
Really alive.

404
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,365
Most people don't have it,

405
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,784
what it takes to see
the whole story.

406
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,329
Being able to live
with it, to use it.

407
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,291
That's why there's a hell of a lot
more of them than us.

408
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,335
Us?

409
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,172
Yeah.

410
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,428
'Cause you have it, Andrea.

411
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,513
You made it.

412
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,434
So enjoy it.

413
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,021
Eat, drink, and be merry,
for tomorrow we die.

414
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,606
Oh, I'm not
planning on dying.

415
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,609
No, neither am I.
It just happens.

416
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,530
Other things happen.

417
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,059
Glenn: We just hit the powdered
formula jackpot.

418
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,395
Maggie:
Oh, thank God.

419
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,940
I also got beans, batteries,

420
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,192
cocktail wieners,
many mustards.

421
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,736
It's a straight shot back
to the prison from here.

422
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,822
Probably make it
in time for dinner.

423
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,116
I like the quiet.

424
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,576
Back there, back home,
you can always hear them

425
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,745
outside the fence
no matter where you are.

426
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,417
And where is it y'all good people
are calling home?

427
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,755
Merle?

428
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,925
( laughs )

429
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,053
Wow!

430
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,181
Hey, back the hell up!

431
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,267
Okay, okay, honey.

432
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,768
Jesus.

433
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,104
You made it.

434
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:39,610
Can you tell me,
is my brother alive?

435
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,279
- Huh?
- Yeah.

436
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:48,578
Hey, you take me to him
and I'll call it even

437
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,955
on everything that happened
up there in Atlanta.

438
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,125
No hard feelings.
Huh?

439
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,131
( laughs )
You like that?

440
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,841
Yeah.

441
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:07,263
Well, I found myself
a medical supply warehouse.

442
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,140
Fixed it up myself.

443
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,310
( laughs )
Pretty cool, huh?

444
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,146
We'll tell Daryl you're here
and he'll come out to meet you.

445
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,857
- Hold on. Just hold up.
- Whoa. Whoa.

446
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,109
Hold up here.
Hold up.

447
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,821
Hey, the fact that we found
each other is a miracle.

448
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,199
Come on, now.

449
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,243
You can trust me.

450
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,953
You trust us.

451
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,831
You stay here.

452
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,334
( chuckles )

453
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,715
No!

454
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,137
Hey, hey, hold up,
buddy, hold up.

455
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,014
Let go of her.
Let go of her!

456
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,849
Merle: Put that gun
in the car right now.

457
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,643
Put it in the car, son.

458
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,190
There you go. Now we're gonna
go for a little drive.

459
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,067
We're not going
back to our camp.

460
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,944
No, we're going
somewhere else.

461
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,197
Get in the car, Glenn!
You're driving!

462
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,533
- Move!
- Don't.

463
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,201
Okay.

464
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,370
Merle: Get up.

465
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,248
That's it.

466
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,253
( engine starts )

467
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,153
Oh, that's what
I'm talking about.

468
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,033
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

469
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,744
Yeah, buddy.

470
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,205
What the hell
you need slippers for?

471
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,458
You know,
end of the day, relaxing.

472
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,880
( walker growling )

473
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,886
( exhales )

474
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,055
All right.

475
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,267
Must have been in
the cell at the end.

476
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,480
We checked
everywhere else.

477
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,658
That's Carol's knife.

478
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,676
( ringing )

479
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,359
How did you know
my name?

480
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,322
Woman:
Because we know you.

481
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,324
How do you know me?

482
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,327
And you know them, Rick.

483
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,497
The people you were
talking to today,

484
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,666
that was Amy,
Jim, Jacqui.

485
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,335
Lori?

486
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,515
Lori?

487
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,601
Lori? Lori?

488
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,520
( crying )

489
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,980
What happened, Rick?

490
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,859
Baby, what happened?

491
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,365
I loved you.

492
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,828
I loved you.

493
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,668
I couldn't put it
back together.

494
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:09,213
I couldn't
put it back together.

495
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,382
I thought it was...
( sobbing )

496
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,851
I made a deal
with myself.

497
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,398
I would keep you alive.

498
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:33,028
I'd find a place.
I would fix that.

499
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,989
And then...

500
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,952
I couldn't open that door.
I couldn't risk it.

501
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,748
I was gonna
keep you alive.

502
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,752
Carl, the baby.
And then...

503
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,590
I thought
there'd be time.

504
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,633
There's never time.

505
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,764
But I loved you.

506
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,266
I love you.

507
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,021
I couldn't put it
back together.

508
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,275
I should have said it.

509
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:15,654
I should-- I should
have said it.

510
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,656
( breaking up )
Rick.

511
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,951
Now you listen to me.

512
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,913
You have a baby.

513
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,790
Our baby.

514
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,502
And Carl.

515
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,755
And the others.

516
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,466
I love you.

517
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,426
Rick.

518
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,595
( voice garbled )

519
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,307
Can you do that?

520
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,392
Can you do that?

521
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:50,815
Rick? Rick?

522
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,817
Rick?

523
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,322
Rick? Rick?

524
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,688
( knocking )

525
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,860
I lied when I said
I was off the clock.

526
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,863
This is a 24/7 kind of gig.

527
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,991
Should I hide
under the bed?

528
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,201
Not this time.

529
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,012
Company?

530
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,727
Yeah.

531
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,229
- We lost all three guys.
- ( sighs )

532
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:16,108
Tim, Crowley,
the other one.

533
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,903
Gargulio.

534
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,905
Jesus.

535
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,074
Yeah, she cut Tim down,
put her sword through him.

536
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,994
Then biters got
in the middle of it,

537
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,872
then I got her.

538
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,666
Damn.

539
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,086
Well, we'll dress it up.
Give 'em a hero's funeral.

540
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,632
You tell a story.
A supply run gone sideways.

541
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,592
Do you have 'em?

542
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,389
Her head.
The sword.

543
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:52,353
Um, we got caught
in a crowd.

544
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,439
The kid had the head,
Crowley had the sword.

545
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,692
They both got all tore up.

546
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,446
I got something else
for you, though.

547
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,782
A guy I used to know
from the Atlanta camp

548
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,117
and his pretty
little girlfriend.

549
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,789
- They know Andrea?
- Mm-hmm.

550
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,669
Anyone else?

551
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,671
Don't know.

552
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,881
Found them on
the return trip.

553
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,051
From the looks of 'em,
they got to be set up pretty good.

554
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,471
I'll find out where.

555
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,025
Everything okay?

556
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,862
Hell, yeah.

557
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,366
( baby fussing )

558
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,467
Hey.

559
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,552
Hey.

560
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,952
( door clanking )

561
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:37,226
( breathing heavily )

562
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,102
( chuckles )

563
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,480
She looks like you.

564
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,655
Hey, just-- you got her?

565
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,782
- Yeah.
- All right.

566
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,034
Okay.

567
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,332
( fence rattling )

568
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,513
( fence rattling )

569
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,766
( walkers growling )

570
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,001
( theme music playing )
