1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,630
( barking )

2
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,132
Come on. Get it!

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,930
Thanks.

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,101
Man in cap:
Thank you.

5
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,853
Brownie: Yeah. Pack of smokes
and Brown Thunder.

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,481
- Merle: Don't get cocky, boy.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,525
Cold drinks?

8
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,026
Been running
the freezers all day.

9
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,696
Not the most practical use
of the generators to my mind.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,698
It's kind of amazing.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,075
The Governor
feels it's worth it.

12
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,202
Well, to a great party.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,871
Now, if you would just
drop me a hint about tonight.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,791
Hmm.

15
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,085
Mere words cannot
adequately describe

16
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,878
the festivities ahead.

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,088
Hmm.

18
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,590
( music playing,
voices overlapping )

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,437
Hey!

20
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,106
( soft music playing )

21
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,287
( raspy breathing )

22
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,168
( snarling )

23
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,045
Penny. Penny, no.

24
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,596
Easy, Penny.
That's good.

25
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,015
( snarling )

26
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,353
It's nap time now.

27
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,440
Nap time.

28
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,901
( growls )

29
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,282
Penny, no.

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,159
Penny.
Hey, hey, hey.

31
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,702
Come on.
Come on.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,662
Take it easy.

33
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,499
Hey, hey.
Come on.

34
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,793
It's all right.

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,879
- Hey, I'm here.
- ( Penny moans )

36
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,633
Daddy still loves you.

37
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,469
You know that, right?

38
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,679
- ( snarling )
- Hey.

39
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,310
All right.
All right.

40
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,479
Come on. Yeah.

41
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,482
Hey, Penny.

42
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,069
( Penny whines )

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,332
( theme music playing )

44
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,786
( crying echoes )

45
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,459
( panting )

46
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,010
( muffled )
Rick, you with me?

47
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,511
Rick?

48
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,267
Let me see the baby.

49
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,185
What are we
gonna feed it?

50
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,729
We got anything
a baby can eat?

51
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,442
The good news is
she looks healthy.

52
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,235
But she needs formula.

53
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,237
And soon or she
won't survive.

54
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,907
Nope. No way.
Not her.

55
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,909
We ain't losing nobody else.
I'm going for a run.

56
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,619
- I'll back you up.
- I'll go, too.

57
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,455
Okay, think where
we're going. Beth.

58
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,707
Kid just lost his mom.

59
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,501
- His dad ain't doing so hot.
- I'll look out for him.

60
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,296
( muffled baby crying )

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,132
You two get the fence.

62
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,759
Too many pile up, we got
ourselves a problem.

63
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,220
Glenn, Maggie, vámonos.

64
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,932
Rick!

65
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,603
Daryl:
Get the gate.

66
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,439
Come on, we're gonna
lose the light.

67
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,112
There's a Piggly Wiggly
on 85.

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,114
No, the baby section's
been cleared.

69
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,450
Lori asked me to keep an eye out.
I haven't had much luck.

70
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,328
Is there any place that hasn't been
completely looted?

71
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,790
We saw signs for a shopping
center just north of here.

72
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,291
Yeah, but there's too much
debris on the road.

73
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,501
A car will never
get through there.

74
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,378
I can take one of you.

75
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,963
I'll go.

76
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,131
No, Maggie,

77
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,467
after everything that you've
been through, okay, I'll go.

78
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,303
I want to go.
For Lori, I have to.

79
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,057
Okay.

80
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,812
I love you.
Be safe.

81
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,150
I will.

82
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,986
( revs motor )

83
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,127
( gate screeches )

84
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,968
( bangs )

85
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,303
- ( snarling )
- ( Rick shouts )

86
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,777
All right.

87
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,779
Hey.

88
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,575
First time we gathered,
there was nine of us

89
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:11,287
holed up in an apartment
with Spam and saltine crackers.

90
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,248
Well, look at us now.

91
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,333
( laughs )

92
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,253
We've built a place
we can call home.

93
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,423
May be held together
with duct tape and string,

94
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,300
but it works.

95
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,344
It's ours. I'll take it.

96
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,472
( laughs )

97
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,224
So today

98
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,685
we celebrate
how far we've come.

99
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,816
We remember those
we've lost.

100
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,987
We raise a glass... to us.

101
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,906
( cheering )

102
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,325
Man:
Hear, hear!

103
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,389
( thumping )

104
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,835
Milton: ...suggesting we delay
a couple of days.

105
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,463
Governor: We can't wait.
Everything's ready.

106
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,674
I love a party as much
as the next fella.

107
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,676
Trust me,
I love a party.

108
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,803
- But we're using a lot of resources.
- Yeah.

109
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,430
For instance,
the generators.

110
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,015
I thought
you love a party.

111
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,350
Merle: Come on, Milty,
lighten up, for Christ's sake.

112
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,020
Let your hair down, man.
Have some fun for once.

113
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,063
- I like fun.
- Then there's no problem.

114
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,565
If I might.

115
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,610
You know, I've been working
on an experiment all week.

116
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,695
It's been a challenge getting
the level of power I need.

117
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,030
And with everything
going on tonight--

118
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,281
What are you asking?

119
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,326
- Postpone tonight.
- No way.

120
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,077
Hang on.
Let's hear him out.

121
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,746
- How long do you need?
- I don't need long.

122
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,539
- How long?
- 10 days.

123
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,832
- No.
- Six?

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,375
- No.
- How about--

125
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,211
How about you enjoy
yourself tonight

126
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,089
and then begin the experiment
over in the morning, huh?

127
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,176
Uh, yeah.
That could work.

128
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,375
( flies buzzing )

129
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,462
( snarling )

130
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,266
( snarling )

131
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,826
( exhales )

132
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,995
( door creaks )

133
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,248
( bangs )

134
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,171
( door opens )

135
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,180
You get off on that?

136
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,019
Poking around other
people's things?

137
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,775
Hmm?

138
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,739
We got nothing
to hide here.

139
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,990
People with nothing to hide

140
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,117
don't usually
feel the need to say so.

141
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,828
That's fair.

142
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,792
We all have
our secrets, huh?

143
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,128
Like Penny?

144
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,884
You know about Penny?

145
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,472
Then you know
I loved her.

146
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,101
Bet you say that
about all the girls.

147
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,196
You got the wrong
idea about me.

148
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,615
I'm just a guy
trying to do right

149
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,243
by the people
I care about.

150
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,830
Now, you want to leave,
Andrea wants to stay.

151
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,291
So you want me to take
choice out of the equation.

152
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,002
You want me
to kick you out.

153
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,176
Actually, I was about
to give your sword back.

154
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,765
'Cause you fit in.

155
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,978
We've enjoyed having you.

156
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,200
This is a real problem
for me.

157
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,455
People follow the rules.
And whether or not it's true,

158
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,124
they believe it's what
keeps them alive.

159
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,587
You've turned that
upside down.

160
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,130
You've broken the rules.

161
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,966
If I don't do anything,
I invite anarchy.

162
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,636
How about this?

163
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,141
I keep a lid
on your little outburst,

164
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,602
you join the research team.

165
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,563
You obviously have skills
and you're not afraid of biters.

166
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,982
Merle will take care
of you and then--

167
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,349
( door bangs )

168
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,693
- Merle: How'd it go?
- ( chuckles )

169
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,323
She's all personality,
that one.

170
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,910
Do we have a problem?

171
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,038
No. No.

172
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,542
Send Andrea over to me.

173
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,294
You can take the research team
to get more grist for the mill.

174
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,255
I can handle this.

175
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,215
All right.

176
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,559
( door closes )

177
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,169
How's the perimeter look?

178
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,464
We got the walkers
spread out.

179
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,799
Need help?

180
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:36,685
Your friends, they--
they were good folks.

181
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,437
They were family.

182
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,941
I think I had one friend
like that my whole life.

183
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,111
You got a whole group.

184
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,655
Sorry you lost 'em.

185
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,542
I need two more.

186
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,057
- Rick?
- Still inside.

187
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,643
Okay, I'll get him.

188
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,106
A third of our group
in one day.

189
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,400
'Cause of one asshole.

190
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,238
Part of me wishes
that we killed

191
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,158
all the prisoners on sight.

192
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,121
Axel and Oscar
seem like good guys.

193
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,460
When the evacuations started,

194
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:47,172
T-Dog drove his church van to
the home of every senior he knew

195
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,342
just in case
they needed a ride.

196
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,596
He saved my ass
a thousand times.

197
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,848
He wasn't just a good guy.

198
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,600
He was the best.

199
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,270
Got bit closing the gate.

200
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,065
If he hadn't done that...

201
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,275
It could have been Maggie.

202
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,863
It's wrong, but...

203
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,200
I'd trade any number of people
for one of ours any day.

204
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,881
What's wrong?
Merle said it was urgent.

205
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,553
I need your help.

206
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,639
- It's Michonne.
- What about her?

207
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,516
She broke in,
stole her weapon.

208
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,727
She can't steal
something that's hers.

209
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,812
Then she went into
a private place

210
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,357
and slaughtered half a dozen
captive biters.

211
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,360
Why would you have
captive biters?

212
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,656
There's a good reason
I don't want to go into right now.

213
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,158
Okay.

214
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,076
Point is, I tried
to talk to her about it

215
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,953
and she pulled
her sword on me.

216
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,122
Held it to my throat.

217
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,543
Can't imagine
that surprises you.

218
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,380
She wouldn't do that
unless she felt threatened.

219
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,799
She makes people
uncomfortable.

220
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,968
Some people want her to leave
and I don't want that.

221
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,053
It's ugly out there and it's getting
worse every day.

222
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,140
But she put my back
against the wall here.

223
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,642
What are you saying?

224
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,395
I'm saying what works out
there doesn't work in here.

225
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,064
You know,
we're not barbarians.

226
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,574
- We got to talk.
- We got to go.

227
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,537
The Governor told me
what happened.

228
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,706
Michonne, you can't
do things like this.

229
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,584
You're freaking people out.
You're freaking me out.

230
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,878
The northeast wall
is guarded by some girl.

231
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,463
We can escape there
after dark.

232
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,965
We are not
prisoners here.

233
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,176
No one who comes
here leaves.

234
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,928
What are you talking about?

235
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,555
It's safe. There's food,
there's shelter.

236
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,349
There's people,
for God's sake.

237
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,767
That's what
they show you.

238
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,727
But you can't leave
unless they make you.

239
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,146
You are not making
any sense.

240
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,482
Mich, maybe you need
to sit for a minute.

241
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,317
You need to trust me.

242
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,319
And you need to give
me more to go on.

243
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,154
We got a good thing
going here.

244
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,990
- I thought this was temporary.
- And I think we need this.

245
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,909
I want to give
this place a real shot.

246
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,245
- I tried.
- Breaking into houses?

247
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,996
That is not trying.

248
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,040
That is sabotaging.

249
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,590
This place is not
what they say it is.

250
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,124
Rick?

251
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,843
Everybody's worried
about you.

252
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,137
You shouldn't be in here.

253
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,182
Come on out.

254
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,608
Rick.

255
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,569
You don't have to do
this all by yourself.

256
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,446
Okay?

257
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,907
Our cell block
is cleared.

258
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,993
We'll just close off
all the doors again.

259
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,495
Rick, why don't you
just come on out with me?

260
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,623
Okay?

261
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,043
- Rick.
- ( grunts )

262
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,754
( panting )

263
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,511
( softly )
Yeah... yeah...

264
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,889
It's me.

265
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,296
( high-pitched whining )

266
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,033
Hey, all right.

267
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,327
We got us a bite.

268
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,498
Yeah, we got us some.
Let's hook 'em up.

269
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,918
( snarling, moaning )

270
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,882
That's it.

271
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,970
Ho! Ho!

272
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,848
Ho, whoa!
Look what we got here.

273
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,850
Oh, yeah.
Come get it.

274
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,060
Come get it.
Whoa! Jeez!

275
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,229
Look at this one.
Little too little.

276
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,481
- We're gonna have to kill it.
- Hold on.

277
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,859
There's something
interesting in its eyes.

278
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,737
- So don't kill it?
- It's a maybe for me.

279
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,072
Here you go.

280
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,199
Get your hands
dirty for once, huh?

281
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,035
All right. Come on.
Come on down.

282
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,786
Let 'em down now.

283
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,080
- Come on, Milty.
- ( winch whines )

284
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,667
( growling )

285
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,171
Get her, boy!
Get her!

286
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,048
Oh, yeah!

287
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,051
Oh! Oh, man!
I tell you what,

288
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,386
I take back everything
I said about that jacket.

289
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,888
Come here.
Let me see her.

290
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,931
Let me see her.

291
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,519
Merle, check this one out.

292
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,396
He's almost as ugly as you.

293
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,149
Holy shit!
Yeah, he's a mean one, huh?

294
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,902
Look at him.

295
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,196
Yeah, now get him down now.
Come on, get him down.

296
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,323
Get him down.
Yeow!

297
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,908
Easy now.
Open up, baby.

298
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,035
Got him! Yeah!

299
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,162
There we go.
Come on.

300
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,872
Don't give me
no shit, boy.

301
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,916
There.

302
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,925
- ( motor stops )
- Company's close.

303
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,968
Stay tight.

304
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,327
( smashes )

305
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,527
( faint rattling )

306
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,219
( scratching )

307
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,124
( hisses )

308
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,001
( squeals )

309
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,461
Hello, dinner.

310
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,256
I'm not putting that
in my bag.

311
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,389
( music playing )

312
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,731
Merle:
Hey, hey, hey, girls.

313
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,984
Where y'all off to
in such a hurry?

314
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,069
Huh?

315
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,703
Hey, come on, now.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

316
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,747
Y'all are breaking my heart
running away like that.

317
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,749
We're leaving.

318
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,043
It's almost curfew.

319
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,254
I'd have to arrange
an escort.

320
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:14,882
I mean, the party's
still going on.

321
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,888
All right.

322
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,432
Wait here a second.

323
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,770
Brownie.
Come here.

324
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,523
Listen up, bro.

325
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,948
The Governor told us we were free
to come and go whenever we liked.

326
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,910
Sweetheart,
nothing personal here,

327
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,330
but you're gonna
have to step back.

328
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,548
See?

329
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,092
There's always a reason
why we can't leave yet.

330
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,555
Clear.

331
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,641
Now if I was y'all, I'd find some
shelter before nightfall.

332
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,360
( gate creaks )

333
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,494
They knew we were coming.
This was all for show.

334
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,705
Do you hear yourself?
How can you know that?

335
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,749
And why would they bother?

336
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,668
- Ladies.
- Close the gates.

337
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,212
No.

338
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,255
I practically begged
the Governor to let you stay.

339
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,924
- I didn't ask for that.
- You didn't have to.

340
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,967
That's what friends
do for each other.

341
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,511
It goes both ways.

342
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,137
So you want to
run around out there

343
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,972
with walkers
on chains eating twigs?

344
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,058
- Is that right?
- We held our own.

345
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,603
Eight months. Eight months on
the road moving place to place,

346
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,814
scavenging,
living in a meat locker.

347
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,899
That was no life.

348
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,276
I'm tired. I'm tired.

349
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,321
I don't have another eight
months in me. Not like that.

350
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,615
And you, I...

351
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,411
What about me?

352
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,746
I'm afraid you're
gonna disappear.

353
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,084
We always talked about
this place, didn't we?

354
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,794
A refuge.

355
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,630
That idea is what
kept us going.

356
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,972
Are you coming or not?

357
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,810
Don't do this.

358
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,603
Don't give me
an ultimatum.

359
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,771
Not after everything.

360
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,816
Are you coming or not?

361
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,951
You'd just
slow me down anyway.

362
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,664
Michonne!

363
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,261
( bangs )

364
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,420
I'm sorry things didn't work out
with your friend.

365
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,011
Weird to lose someone
by their own choice.

366
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,056
Thought those days
had gone.

367
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,851
Not sure this will
make you feel better,

368
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,771
but I'm sure you
could use a drink.

369
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,731
Some company.

370
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,152
Something to take your mind
off of it for a bit.

371
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,615
Come on.

372
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,377
( snarling )

373
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,591
( motor roars )

374
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,926
Guys, they're back!

375
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,803
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

376
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,555
You want some of this?
Come on!

377
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,848
Come on!

378
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,896
( gunshots )

379
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,232
Axel: You want some of this?
Come on! Come on!

380
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,279
( baby crying )

381
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,239
Beth.

382
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,701
Daryl:
How's she doing?

383
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,497
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

384
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,419
Shh...

385
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,600
Come on.
Come on.

386
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,103
( crying stops )

387
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,148
( chuckles )

388
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,487
She got a name yet?

389
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,906
Not yet.

390
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,535
But I was thinking
maybe Sophia.

391
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,955
Then there's Carol, too.

392
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,917
And...

393
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,836
( sighs )
Andrea.

394
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,212
Amy.

395
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,840
Jacqui.

396
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,468
Patricia.

397
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:55,473
Or... Lori.
I don't know.

398
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,480
Yeah...
You like that? Huh?

399
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,690
Little ass-kicker.

400
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,611
Right? That's a good
name, right?

401
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,405
Little ass-kicker.
You like that, huh?

402
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,991
You like that, sweetheart?

403
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,380
( faint grunting )

404
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,011
( snarling )

405
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,787
( grunts )

406
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,757
- ( screams )
- ( gunshot )

407
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,020
( grunting )

408
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,065

Come on, this way.

It's a little loud.

- ( music ends )
- ( cheering )

423
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,199
- Come on!
- I don't feel--

425
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,710

Merle! Merle! Merle!

429
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,483
Merle! Merle!
Merle!

430
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,741
I'm gonna kick
his ass one-handed.

431
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,744
Oh, the hell with it.
No-handed!

432
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,913
Yeah!

434
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,334
Whoo!

435
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,586
No hands!

436
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,922
Bring it on.

437
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,259
( snarling )

438
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,263
All right,
let's get it on!

439
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,933

440
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,898

441
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,444
Yeah!
Come on!

442
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,072
Come on, get up.
Get up.

443
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,324
Want some more?

444
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,664
( snarls )

445
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,626
He's got nothing.
Nothing, folks.

446
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,466
- Get up.
- Come on!

447
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,259
Okay, come on.

448
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,684
Whoo!

449
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,398
- ( blows whistle )
- Hey!

450
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,857
Come on,
let 'em fight.

451
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,487
( crowd booing )

452
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,409
Merle: Come on, pretty boy.
Let's dance.

453
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,584
Hey, hey!
Where you going?

454
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,752
What the hell is this?

455
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,088
It's a way
to blow off steam.

456
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,506
Blow off steam?

457
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,049
You go for a jog
to blow off steam.

458
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,926
This is-- this is sick.

459
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,345
Look around.
Everyone's having a great time.

460
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,431
It's barbaric.

461
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,895
( quietly )
It's staged.

462
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,313
( laughs )

463
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,524
Yeah, we pull out
the biter's teeth.

464
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,026
It's just all for show.

465
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,736
( snarling )

466
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,696
That's crazy.

467
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,531
This is your reason
for keeping walkers around?

468
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,199
People need entertainment.

469
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,993
So your solution
is gladiator fights?

470
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:33,871
We're reducing these things.
We're controlling them.

471
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,832
We're shining a light on
the monster under the bed.

472
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,584
It's fun.

473
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,711
It makes people feel better
about the whole thing.

474
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,212
It's a slippery slope.

475
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,423
You're teaching them
that walkers aren't dangerous.

476
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,217
We're teaching them
not to be afraid.

477
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,766
Come on, baby.

478
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,400
Come on.
Walk it off, huh?

479
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,116
Uno!

480
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,494
Dos!

481
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,245
- Tres!
- ( whistle blows )

482
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,082
( crowd cheering )

483
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,663
( baby's crying echoes )

484
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,091
( phone ringing )

485
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,389
( ringing continues )

486
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,954
Hello?

487
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,168
( theme music playing )
