1
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,751
( tapping )

2
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,507
( clicks )

3
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,657
( metal rattles )

4
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,535
( footsteps )

5
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,365
We have a lot to talk about.

6
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,207
( theme music playing )

7
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,828
You attacked us.

8
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,955
Makes things pretty clear.

9
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,957
I was trying
to make things clear.

10
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,377
I could have killed you all.
I didn't.

11
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,340
And here we are.

12
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,346
I'm gonna remove my weapon.

13
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,598
Show that I mean
to negotiate in good faith.

14
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,850
I'd like you
to do the same.

15
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,270
May I?

16
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,002
See?

17
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,171
No trouble.

18
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,633
Now you.

19
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,690
Well...

20
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,692
suit yourself.

21
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,443
( chuckles )

22
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,961
He's already in there.

23
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,630
Sat down with Rick.

24
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,094
I don't see any cars.

25
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,346
It don't feel right.

26
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,598
Keep it running.

27
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,145
( car approaching )

28
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,814
Heads up.

29
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,084
What the hell? Why's your boy
already in there?

30
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,754
- He's here?
- Yup.

31
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,884
( sighs )

32
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,518
- What's going on?
- Governor: Nothing.

33
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,354
Your friend isn't much
for small talk.

34
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,399
You want to talk, talk.

35
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,902
I wanted you to talk.

36
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,780
Too many people have died
for no reason.

37
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,823
Let's end this.

38
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,284
Save the bullets
for the real threat.

39
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,245
We can solve this.

40
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,540
That's why I asked you
to come here.

41
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,210
I know what you've done.

42
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,880
I heard about
the raids, the heads,

43
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,257
- Maggie.
- Merle did that.

44
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,260
No. You know what
I'm talking about.

45
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,596
You know all about me
and I know all about you.

46
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,431
I don't care about
any of that.

47
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,767
We're here to move forward.

48
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,120
Maybe I should
go inside.

49
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,289
The Governor thought it best
if he and Rick spoke privately.

50
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,750
Who the hell are you?

51
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,002
Milton Mamet.

52
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,630
Great.
He brought his butler.

53
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,341
- ( chuckles )
- I'm his advisor.

54
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,426
Daryl:
What kind of advice?

55
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,846
Planning. Biters.

56
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,806
Uh, you know, I'm sorry.

57
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,475
I don't feel like I need to explain
myself to the henchmen.

58
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,144
You better watch
your mouth, sunshine.

59
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,311
Look, if you and I are gonna
be out here

60
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,313
pointing guns
at each other all day,

61
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,483
do me a favor,
shut your mouth.

62
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,488
We don't need this.
If all goes south in there,

63
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,991
we'll be at each other's
throats soon enough.

64
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,594
Glenn:
Carl, come here.

65
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,056
You stash these
at the loading dock. All right?

66
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,517
Beth, put more
up on the catwalk.

67
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,768
If anyone gets pinned down,

68
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,937
we need to make sure that
they have plenty of ammo.

69
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,191
I'll go work on
the cage outside.

70
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,028
What we should be doing is loading
some of this firepower

71
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,114
in a truck and paying
a visit to the Governor.

72
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,158
We know where he is
right now.

73
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,327
Are you suggesting that
we just go in and kill him?

74
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,454
Yeah, I am.

75
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,040
We told Rick and Daryl
that we'd stay put.

76
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,042
I've changed my mind,
sweetheart.

77
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,420
Being on the sideline
with my brother out there

78
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,214
ain't sitting right
with me.

79
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,424
Glenn: The three of them are right
in the middle of it.

80
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,510
No idea we're coming. They could
get taken hostage or killed.

81
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,221
A thousand things
could go wrong.

82
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,556
And they will.

83
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,976
My dad can take care
of himself.

84
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,978
Sorry, son,
but your dad's head

85
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,231
could be on a pike
real soon.

86
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,903
Don't say that to him.

87
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,451
It's not the right move.

88
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,828
Not now.

89
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,456
Can't take the risk
of putting them in the crossfire.

90
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,708
That's my decision.
It's final.

91
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,839
I've known you both
at different times,

92
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,175
but only after the world
went to shit.

93
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,261
And you both stepped up
for the good of others

94
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,887
at great personal risk.

95
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,848
- There's no reason--
- Get to it.

96
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,934
Woodbury takes
west of the river.

97
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,436
The prison takes east.

98
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,439
No one crosses,
no one trades.

99
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,359
Andrea:
He's right.

100
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,111
We should hammer out boundaries,
then leave each other--

101
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,488
- I'm sorry, what is this?
- It's a solution.

102
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,074
( laughs )
Absolutely not.

103
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,742
What the hell am I doing here?
You told me--

104
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,869
- Told him what?
- You told me he was willing to talk.

105
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,914
I am,
but the truth is, Rick,

106
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,084
she's in no position to make
such an offer anyway.

107
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,962
I'm here
for one thing only--

108
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,339
your surrender.

109
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,008
Oh, you want surrender?
Come get it.

110
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,343
You think we hit
Woodbury heavy last time?

111
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,471
Just take it easy, all right?
We're here to settle this.

112
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,266
You're right.
Would you step outside?

113
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,475
What?

114
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,935
Rick and I, we got
a lot to talk about.

115
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,188
- I'm not leaving.
- I came to talk to him.

116
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,697
So you're the Governor.

117
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,408
That's-- that's their
term, not mine.

118
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,202
Oh.

119
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,454
But still,

120
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,581
you're beholden
to your people.

121
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,417
- Well, of course.
- You have responsibility to them.

122
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,836
Mm-hmm.

123
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,381
Wasn't Merle
your lieutenant?

124
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,716
He was helpful, yeah.

125
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,052
But you knew
he was erratic.

126
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,223
You blame him for scooping up
Glenn and Maggie in the first place?

127
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,892
Exactly. I was trying
to sort it out

128
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,144
when you attacked.

129
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,687
So it was his fault?

130
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,023
He's a wild card,
but he's effective.

131
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,861
He gets the dirty jobs done.

132
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,824
I thought you'd take
responsibility.

133
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,995
I thought you were a cop,
not a lawyer.

134
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,625
Either way, I don't pretend
to be a governor.

135
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,713
I told you,
I'm their leader.

136
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,757
You're the town drunk

137
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,761
who knocked over my fence
and ripped up my yard,

138
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,264
nothing more.

139
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,644
Didn't you ever
misjudge someone?

140
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,441
Hmm?

141
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,860
Andrea told me
about your baby.

142
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,532
That it might be
your partner's.

143
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,119
But you're caring for her
and I admire that.

144
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,414
Restitution for your
own lack of insight.

145
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,294
For failing to see
the devil beside you.

146
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,298
Oh, I see him, all right.

147
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,595
( laughs )

148
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,437
I brought whiskey.

149
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,105
( laughs )

150
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,620
( exhales )

151
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,169
There's no reason not to use
this time we have together

152
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,505
to explore the issues
ourselves.

153
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,467
- Boss said to sit tight and shut up.
- Don't you mean the Governor?

154
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,594
It's a good thing
they're sitting down,

155
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,804
especially after
what happened.

156
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,307
They're gonna work it out.
Nobody wants another battle.

157
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,850
I wouldn't exactly
call it a battle.

158
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,145
I would call it
a battle and I did.

159
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,356
I recorded it.

160
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,857
For what?

161
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,151
Somebody's got to keep a record
of what we've gone through.

162
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,819
It'll be a part
of our history.

163
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,030
That makes sense.

164
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,201
I've got dozens
of interviews--

165
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,078
- ( metal clangs )
- ( walkers snarling )

166
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,709
( walkers growling )

167
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,925
( walkers snarling )

168
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,057
After you.

169
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,059
No way.
You first.

170
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,603
( sighs )

171
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,230
( roars )

172
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,403
Pussy.

173
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,758
( sighs )

174
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,825
Look what he's got.

175
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,792
Nah, I prefer menthols.

176
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,961
Douchebag.

177
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,638
You army or something?

178
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,765
Nah, I just--

179
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,808
just hate these things.

180
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,310
Yeah.

181
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,687
After what they did

182
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,940
to my wife, kids.

183
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,819
Sucks.

184
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,156
Thanks.

185
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,332
This is a joke, right?

186
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,292
They ain't gonna
work anything out.

187
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,877
Sure, they'll do
their little dance

188
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,880
and tomorrow,
next day...

189
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,759
they'll give the word.

190
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,928
I know.

191
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,557
Hey.

192
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,192
May I ask how
you lost your leg?

193
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,611
I was bit.

194
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,781
So you cut off your leg

195
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,701
to keep the infection
from spreading?

196
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,452
Interesting.

197
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,996
How long after
the initial bite?

198
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,040
Immediately.

199
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,542
You didn't bleed out?

200
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,877
We have good people.

201
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,713
They took care of me.

202
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,506
Doctors?

203
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,049
No.

204
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,385
We learned
by trial and error.

205
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,680
Me, too.

206
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,562
May I see it?

207
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,272
Your stump.
I'd like to, um...

208
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,442
ahem, see where
the amputation was.

209
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,402
How high above the bite.

210
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,071
I'm not showing you
my leg.

211
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,532
It's important data.

212
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,033
I just met you.

213
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,078
At least buy me
a drink first.

214
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,581
( laughs )

215
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,762
I care about my people

216
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,305
and I don't take
their deaths lightly,

217
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,265
and I know
you don't either.

218
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,517
In a way, this fight,

219
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,102
it's a failure
of leadership.

220
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,604
Then leave us alone.

221
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,273
Well, now, that would be
an even bigger failure.

222
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,819
You've moved into
our backyard.

223
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,238
You shot up Main Street.

224
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,657
If I let that threat
persist, I look weak

225
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,826
and, well,
the whole thing crumbles.

226
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,829
Well, that's your problem.
Your choice.

227
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,540
Now, isn't that
why we're here?

228
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,084
Choice.

229
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,300
If we choose to destroy

230
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,970
everything we've fought for
over the past year...

231
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,062
we're gonna kill
everyone we know.

232
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,982
At your prison.

233
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,276
Back in Woodbury.

234
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,988
People we love, Rick.

235
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,461
I was at work one day

236
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,130
taking shit from a boss
half my age

237
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,259
and an IQ even lower.

238
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,803
And the phone rang.

239
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,764
My wife had been
in an accident.

240
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,185
"Sorry, Mr. Blake, we did
everything we could."

241
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,024
I sat there
holding that phone,

242
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,778
knowing that I would
never see her again.

243
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,617
- ( snaps fingers )
- Gone.

244
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,872
It was just an accident.
No one's fault.

245
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,919
She had left a voicemail
asking me to call her,

246
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,714
but I hadn't had
a chance yet.

247
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,676
I sat there clutching
that phone thinking,

248
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,928
"What did she want?"

249
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,768
Just to check in?

250
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,859
Ask me to pick
something up for dinner?

251
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,078
What did she want?

252
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,777
( walkers snarling )

253
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,577
( grunts )

254
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,021
Hey, you're not going.

255
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,107
I don't need permission.

256
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,403
- I can't let you.
- You can't stop me.

257
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,155
If you're gonna live here with us,
it's gonna be on our terms.

258
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,784
If Michonne can do it,
why can't you?

259
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:11,121
'Cause it's my brother
out there, that's why.

260
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,373
What's the matter
with y'all?

261
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,337
I'm not gonna let you
put them in danger.

262
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,632
Nut up already, boy.

263
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,135
This guy cops a feel
of your woman

264
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,179
and you pussy out
like this?

265
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,223
Get out of my way.

266
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,891
No.

267
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,688
- Get out of my way!
- ( shouting )

268
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,737
Maggie:
Get up!

269
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,197
Get up!

270
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,907
( gunshot )

271
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:58,001
Let me go!
Let me go!

272
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,884
If you'll excuse me.

273
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,366
How's it going in there?

274
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,660
They kicked me out.

275
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,084
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

276
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,252
You're trying to help.

277
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,509
What happened with Maggie?

278
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,179
He's a sick man.

279
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,857
What am I gonna do now?

280
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,989
I can't go back there.

281
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,493
We're family.
You belong with us.

282
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,289
But if you join us,

283
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,458
it's settled.

284
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,045
I know.

285
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,316
You know, the truth is
I didn't want any of this.

286
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,237
They chose me because
there was nobody else around.

287
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,698
( chuckles )

288
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,783
And they still think
that I'm the man

289
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,452
that can keep them safe.

290
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,580
They still think
I know what I'm doing.

291
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,507
I know you got guns.

292
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,511
Mmm. That was quite a stash you
brought back the other day.

293
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,684
Now, my people, they're not
combat-tested like yours are,

294
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,437
but I've got more of them.

295
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:27,025
So this fight, it will
go down to the last man.

296
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:34,073
So let's end it.

297
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,825
Today.

298
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,329
Let's not do this.

299
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,706
We can walk away.

300
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,882
You have something

301
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,092
that I want.

302
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,181
One thing that makes
this all all right.

303
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,058
I'm not giving up
the prison.

304
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,060
( laughs )
No.

305
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,354
No, I--

306
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,065
I don't want your prison.
That doesn't sound safe at all.

307
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,651
I mean, you lost your wife,
another man.

308
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,778
We're not moving on.

309
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,696
What good would that do me?

310
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,783
Best you stay where I can
keep my one good eye on you.

311
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,387
I want Michonne.

312
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,515
Turn her over
and this all goes away.

313
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,062
Is she worth it?

314
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,358
One woman...

315
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,780
worth all those lives
at your prison?

316
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,994
Is she?

317
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,681
You know I'm right.

318
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,060
The folks here,

319
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,062
they're strong,

320
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,148
good fighters.

321
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,068
But they ain't killers.

322
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,362
Rick is.

323
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,489
Maggie is.

324
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,116
Carl put down
his own mother.

325
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,617
Mercy killing.

326
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,619
That don't make him
an assassin.

327
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,580
Mmm, but you are.

328
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,124
( chuckles )
When I have to be.

329
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,335
Then how do you explain
letting me get away?

330
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,545
I must have been seduced

331
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,673
by your sterling
personality.

332
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,303
You coming with me or not?

333
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:03,806
Me and my brother, we have a few
calls we use when we hunt.

334
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,017
I'll give him a heads up.

335
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,977
He'll warn the others.

336
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,355
You shogun
the Governor's ass,

337
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,939
I'll take care of the rest.

338
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,818
We'll be home
before you know it.

339
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,445
And what about Andrea?

340
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:22,200
Bullets fly, she's gonna have
to make her choice real quick.

341
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,662
You're on your own.

342
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,707
You get people killed,
it's on you.

343
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,053
( door opens, closes )

344
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,350
( snarling )

345
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,688
( door opens )

346
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,570
Hey.

347
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,906
I thought it was
my watch.

348
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,866
I got it.

349
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,913
Keep you company?

350
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,266
That was a hell
of a choke hold.

351
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,727
I should have
put him to sleep.

352
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,239
When we got back
from Woodbury...

353
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,452
I made it all about me.

354
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,621
And you needed your space
and I didn't give you that.

355
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,957
I didn't need
my space from you.

356
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,626
( sighs )

357
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,837
I just...

358
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,047
wanted you to see me.

359
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,263
( laughs )

360
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm with you.

361
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,185
I'm always with you,
you know?

362
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,606
I'm sorry.

363
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,691
I know.

364
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,402
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

365
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,826
Oh, God, I love you.

366
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,786
I love you.

367
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,929
( walkers snarling )

368
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,806
- Wait.
- Hmm?

369
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,892
I can't do this.

370
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,520
( snarling )

371
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,112
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

372
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,214
- Ow!
- You okay?

373
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,675
( laughing )

374
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,556
( laughing )

375
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,399
( exhales )

376
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,831
( moaning )

377
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,513
Yeah, I don't get it.

378
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,558
You've obviously
got big plans.

379
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,479
Like you're the guy
who's gonna lick this thing.

380
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,483
Bring us back
from the brink.

381
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:28,946
So why waste your time
on a two-bit vendetta?

382
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,657
Why risk it all?

383
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,826
You could have
a statue of yourself

384
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:37,622
in the town square,
Governor.

385
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,003
Killing Michonne

386
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:48,132
is sort of beneath you,
don't you think?

387
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,426
You could save your son.

388
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,472
Save your daughter.

389
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,434
Everyone you know.

390
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,856
It's your choice.

391
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,999
If I give you Michonne,

392
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,877
how do I know
you'll keep your word

393
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,879
that you'll stop?

394
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,598
You can have
everything you want.

395
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,017
I told you,
I don't care about you.

396
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,025
You think about it.

397
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,406
Two days.

398
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,034
I'll be here at noon.

399
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,238

400
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,101

Position gunmen
all around that feed store.

411

The minute you see
Michonne, you open fire.

412
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,299
Kill the others,
but you keep her alive.

413
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,761
What about the deal?

414
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,056
Well, they'll bring Rick,
Merle's brother,

415
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,891
maybe Glenn,
Merle himself.

416
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,060
We can take care
of the whole crew.

417
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,521
It's the best way
to avoid a slaughter.

418
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,774
That is a slaughter.

419
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,073
Not at our end.

420
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,871
We're gonna have to eliminate
Rick sooner or later.

421
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,207
No way we can all live
side by side.

422
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,468
Thanks for setting that up.

423
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,470
You really put
yourself out there.

424
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,556
Glad I could help.

425
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,768
Rick and I set terms.

426
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,353
He's gonna consider them

427
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:15,232
and then we'll meet
again in two days.

428
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,234
What sort of terms?

429
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,909
Hope it works out.

430
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,348
So, I met this Governor.

431
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,437
Sat with him
for quite a while.

432
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,439
Merle:
Just the two of you?

433
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,941
Yeah.

434
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,526
Should have gone
when we had the chance, bro.

435
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,618
He wants the prison.

436
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,957
He wants us gone.

437
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,542
Dead.

438
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,295
He wants us dead

439
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,465
for what we did
to Woodbury.

440
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,604
We're going to war.

The group's taking it

448
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,953
Merle and Michonne
are convinced

449
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,247
we should hit first.

450
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:39,793
Carol and I think we should take
our chances on the road.

451
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,879
We're in this together.

452
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,757
So if we stay and fight,

453
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,592
so be it.

454
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,564
He gave me a choice.

455
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:05,319
A way out.

456
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,488
What does he want?

457
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,617
Michonne.

458
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,080
He'll kill her.

459
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,292
And then kill us anyway.

460
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,591
But what if he doesn't?

461
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,011
What if this is the answer?

462
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:38,727
Why didn't you tell them?

463
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,857
They need

464
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,026
to be scared.

465
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,198
They are.

466
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,283
Good.

467
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,453
'Cause that's the only way
they'll accept it.

468
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,918
She saved my life.

469
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,047
And Carl's.

470
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,299
Glenn, Maggie--

471
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,135
if she hadn't come here,

472
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,470
we never would have known
they were taken.

473
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,973
She's earned her place.

474
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,975
Yeah.

475
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,728
Yeah, she has.

476
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:34,616
Are you willing to sacrifice
your daughters' lives for her?

477
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:44,459
Why are you telling me?

478
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,797
Because...

479
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,093
I'm hoping you can
talk me out of it.

480
