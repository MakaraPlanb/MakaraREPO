1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,629
( birds chirping )

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:08,424
( gate creaks, bangs )

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,976
( panting )

4
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,942
( gasps softly )

5
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,397
( flies buzzing )

6
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,339
( sighs )

7
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,359
( theme music playing )

8
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,457
( knocks )

9
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,468
May I?

10
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,399
That was, uh...

11
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,028
that was quite
a speech you gave.

12
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,448
Exactly what these people
needed to hear.

13
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,162
What about the prison?

14
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,375
As long as they leave us alone,
we have no problem.

15
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,253
- So no retaliation?
- No.

16
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,630
What would that get us?

17
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,382
I need to go see them.

18
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,301
( chuckles )

19
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,430
I thought this place could be
something else, you know?

20
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,349
Something better.

21
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,104
I wasn't up to the challenge
and I screwed it up.

22
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,067
I've done some terrible things.

23
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,322
I'm not fit to lead
these people.

24
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,159
But you are.

25
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,120
They don't need
to be terrorized.

26
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,830
Certainly not by
their own leader.

27
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,540
So you're abdicating?

28
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,045
You know, I really believed

29
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,629
if I kept her alive
long enough,

30
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,590
Milton would find a--

31
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,930
I just need time...

32
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,896
to get myself together.

33
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,816
So you want me
to fill in for you?

34
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,361
Who else can?
Milton? Martinez?

35
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,536
If you choose your friends in
the prison, I'd understand.

36
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,498
But these people need you.

37
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,044
I--

38
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,546
we need you.

39
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,307
( door closes )

40
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,977
( urinating )

41
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,231
There ain't nothing out here
but mosquitoes and ants.

42
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,275
Patience, little brother.

43
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,486
Sooner or later, a squirrel

44
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,321
is bound to scurry
across your path.

45
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,865
Even so,
that ain't much food.

46
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,409
More than nothing.

47
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,579
I'd have better luck going
through one of them houses

48
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,081
we passed
back on the turnoff.

49
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,918
Is that what your new friends
taught you? Hmm?

50
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,587
How to loot for booty?

51
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,341
We've been at it for hours.

52
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,928
Why don't we find a stream,
try our luck with some fish?

53
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,515
I think you're just trying to lead me
back to the road, man.

54
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,226
- Get me over to that prison.
- They got shelter.

55
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,563
Food.
A pot to piss in.

56
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,857
Might not be a bad idea.

57
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,859
For you, maybe.

58
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,444
Ain't gonna be
no damn party for me.

59
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,949
Everyone will get used
to each other.

60
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,953
They're all dead.

61
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,414
Makes no difference.

62
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,624
How can you be so sure?

63
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,754
Right about now he's probably
hosting a housewarming party

64
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,966
where's he gonna bury
what's left of your pals.

65
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,802
( spits )

66
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,263
Let's hook some fish.

67
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,432
Come on.

68
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,566
Right.

69
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,903
Now you said you found
Tyreese's group here?

70
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,322
- Yeah.
- We secured this.

71
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,408
He thought
he came through here.

72
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,580
Means there's another breach.

73
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,583
Okay.

74
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,335
The whole front of
the prison is unsecure.

75
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,086
If walkers
just strolled in,

76
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,796
then it's gonna be cake
for a group of armed men.

77
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,174
Why are we even so sure
he's going to attack?

78
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,968
Maybe you scared him off.

79
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,013
He had fish tanks
full of heads.

80
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,641
Walkers and humans.
Trophies.

81
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,185
He's coming.

82
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,187
- We should hit him now.
- Beth: What?

83
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,272
He won't be expecting it.

84
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,316
We'll sneak back in
and put a bullet in his head.

85
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,443
We're not assassins.

86
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,612
You know where
his apartment is.

87
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,197
You and I could
end this tonight.

88
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,865
( sighs )

89
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,910
I'll do it myself.

90
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,957
Okay.

91
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,709
He didn't know
you were coming last time

92
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,212
and look what happened.

93
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,005
You were almost killed.

94
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,800
Daryl was captured.

95
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,678
And you and Maggie
were almost executed.

96
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,805
You can't stop me.

97
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,723
Hershel:
Rick would never allow this.

98
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,726
You really think he's in any
position to make that choice?

99
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,063
Think this through clearly.
T-Dog lost his life here.

100
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,232
Lori, too.
The men that were here.

101
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,234
It isn't worth
any more killing.

102
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,861
What are we waiting for?
If he's really on his way,

103
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,697
we should be out
of here by now.

104
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,199
- And go where?
- We lived on the road all winter.

105
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,493
Back when you had two legs
and we didn't have a baby

106
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,203
crying for walkers
every four hours.

107
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,330
We can't stay here.

108
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,332
We can't run.

109
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,056
All right.
We'll stay put.

110
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,891
We're gonna defend
this place.

111
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,561
We're making a stand.

112
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,857
Carl, you and I will
go down to the tombs.

113
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,358
We need to figure out
where the breach is.

114
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,110
- You got it.
- Michonne: You'll need some help.

115
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,779
No, in case anything happens,
I need you out here.

116
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,618
Who's on watch?

117
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,954
( sighs )

118
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,123
Damn it.

119
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:19,136
( pulsating tone )

120
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,153
( gasps )

121
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,448
Ahem.

122
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,493
Alpha waves.

123
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,245
I was trying to induce
a meditative state.

124
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,331
I've been having trouble--

125
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,792
your battery, it's over here.

126
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,675
Man on radio: Okay, hold it.
Look at this jackpot.

127
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,469
You've been invaluable.

128
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,310
Do you intend to stay?

129
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,898
Leaving's never
crossed my mind.

130
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,194
Good.

131
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,072
'Cause I count on you.
And not just for your--

132
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,616
your expertise.

133
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,411
But I consider
you a friend.

134
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,080
I-- thank you.

135
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,249
I feel--

136
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,376
me, too.

137
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,671
I counted on
Merle as well.

138
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,677
Martinez,
he's a good soldier.

139
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,763
He'd take a bullet
if I needed him to.

140
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,394
Would you?

141
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,480
I would.

142
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,983
Yes.

143
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,695
And Andrea?

144
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,574
I'm not sure where
her loyalties lie.

145
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,618
I can see how
her previous affiliation

146
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,538
with Merle, no matter
how contentious it was,

147
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,040
could cause doubt.

148
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,751
You keep tabs
on her for me.

149
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,923
Of course.

150
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,678
( door bangs )

151
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,105
Where's Martinez?

152
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,732
I don't know.

153
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,151
Did you see him leave?

154
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,402
Yeah.

155
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,238
Who was he with?

156
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,324
Karen, it's okay.
You can tell me.

157
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,785
I don't know anything.

158
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,124
Milton.

159
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,793
Milton, stop!

160
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,883
You startled me.

161
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,426
Where is he?

162
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,761
Where's who?

163
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,222
The Governor.

164
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,432
He's out on a run?

165
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,476
Is that an answer
or a question?

166
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,395
I'm not sure...
where he is.

167
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,940
I mean, not whether it was
a question or an answer.

168
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,235
- It was an answer.
- A run meaning what specifically?

169
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,612
Supplies would be
a safe bet.

170
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,531
We were wiped out.

171
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,282
Milton, I want you
to give me a specific answer

172
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,786
to a specific question.
Where's the Governor?

173
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,621
On a run?

174
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,415
( sighs )

175
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,960
You know, I bet
he'll be back soon.

176
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,004
I'm sure he's okay,
if that's what you're worried about.

177
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,676
The tombs outside the boiler
room are overrun again.

178
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,344
That whole section
had been cleared.

179
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,429
It's a steady
stream of walkers.

180
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,848
Hershel:
We're wasting time.

181
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,684
The Governor is supposedly
on the way

182
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,477
and we're stuck
in here with walkers.

183
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,271
Trapped between a rock
and a hard place.

184
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,190
For the last time,
running is not an option.

185
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,900
Carol: Glenn, if the tombs
have filled up again,

186
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,027
it may just be a matter
of time before they push in here.

187
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,571
Or until some fence
gives way.

188
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,656
Axel: What if one of them herds
is passing through?

189
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,366
Or settled?

190
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,327
Can't handle that
with just the few of us.

191
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,829
Okay.

192
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,455
All right, we need--

193
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,666
we just need to scout
the far side of the prison.

194
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,918
- Find out what's going on.
- You're going out there?

195
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,087
- Take a car and make it quick.
- I'll drive.

196
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,674
No, you stay here.
Help with the fortifications.

197
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,509
I'll take Maggie.

198
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,845
You sure she's up to that?

199
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,563
( door opens )

200
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,452
Where have you been?

201
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,587
We need to find out how the walkers
are getting into the tombs.

202
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,387
Are we gonna talk
about this?

203
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,310
Maggie, you need
to talk about it.

204
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,979
I do? Or you do?

205
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,817
- What does that mean?
- What do you want me to say?

206
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,944
You want me to say
he made me get naked

207
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,780
and stand in front of him?

208
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,576
He came up behind me.

209
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,913
Pushed himself
against me.

210
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,084
Put his hands
all over me.

211
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,879
He slammed my head down
and bent me over a table.

212
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,009
Did he...

213
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,136
Rape me?

214
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,140
No.

215
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,730
No.

216
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,941
Do you feel better?

217
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,320
- I'm not trying to--
- I had a choice.

218
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,865
Either I take off my shirt
or he would take off your hand.

219
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,786
I just listened to Merle beating
the shit out of you in the other room.

220
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,833
What could I do?

221
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,129
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,677
Go away.

223
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,429
You got your answer.

224
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,764
Now go away.

225
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,411
So we'll reinforce this with
some metal from the yard.

226
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,706
If anything happens,

227
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,167
we'll just duck.

228
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,710
( laughs )

229
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,503
I hope
nothing happens.

230
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,881
Guns scare the bejesus
out of me.

231
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,093
I robbed a gas station
with a toy gun.

232
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,304
Never even took it
out of my pocket.

233
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,932
You said Oscar
was the thief.

234
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,268
That you were in here
for pharmaceuticals.

235
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,146
Well, I didn't want y'all
to think I was a violent man.

236
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,440
If you follow me.

237
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,401
So what
are you saying?

238
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,112
You're in here
for a toy gun?

239
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,072
No, listen to this.

240
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,992
The next day the cops found
me at my brother's house.

241
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,495
Still had the water pistol
in my pocket.

242
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,291
I swore up and down that
that was the only weapon I had,

243
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,251
but they said they didn't believe
anyone could be

244
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,586
so stupid and get away with it.

245
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,880
So they turned my brother's
house upside down

246
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,465
and found his .38.

247
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,467
Said it "matched
the description."

248
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,553
There you go.
Armed robbery.

249
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,764
( laughs )

250
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,476
Tell you the truth, I don't even know
how to use this damn thing.

251
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,522
You're all about
the truth now?

252
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,524
Yes, ma'am, I am.

253
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,484
( clicks )

254
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,945
It's fully loaded.

255
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,324
Let's hope
it stays that way.

256
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,952
You're quite a lady.

257
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,792
Hmm...
( chuckles )

258
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,714
Merle: Smells to me like
the Sawhatchee Creek.

259
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,842
Daryl:
We didn't go west enough.

260
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,177
There's a river down there,
it's got to be the Yellow Jacket.

261
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,221
You have a stroke, boy?

262
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,807
We ain't never even come
close to Yellow Jacket.

263
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,892
We didn't go west.

264
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,811
Just a little bit south.
That's what I think.

265
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,356
( scoffs )
Know what I think?

266
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,900
I may have
lost my hand,

267
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,318
but you lost your sense
of direction.

268
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,863
Yeah, we'll see.

269
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,489
What do you want to bet?

270
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,700
I don't want
to bet nothing.

271
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,660
It's just a body of water.

272
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,662
Why's everything got
to be a competition with you?

273
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,706
Whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, little brother.

274
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,958
Just trying to have
a little fun here.

275
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,751
No need to get
your panties all in a bundle.

276
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,504
- You hear that?
- ( distant crying )

277
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,340
Yeah, wild animals
getting wild.

278
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,051
- No, it's a baby.
- Oh, come on.

279
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,554
Why don't you just piss in my ear
and tell me it's raining, too?

280
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,015
That there's the sound
of a couple of coons

281
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,017
making love, sweet love.
Know what I mean?

282
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,560
( laughs )

283
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,229
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( man yelling in Spanish )

284
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,443
- ( baby crying )
- ( gunshots )

285
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,112
( whistles )
Hey! Jump!

286
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,157
( laughs )

287
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,284
What?

288
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,453
Hey, man, I ain't
wasting my bullets

289
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:49,205
on a couple of strangers
that ain't never cooked me a meal

290
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,540
or felicitated my piece.

291
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,334
That's my policy.

292
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,711
You'd be wise
to adopt it, brother.

293
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,840
( man shouts in Spanish )

294
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,763
( gunshots )

295
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,351
( baby crying )

296
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,937
( speaking Spanish )

297
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,988
( speaking Spanish )

298
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,836
Daryl: Come on, man.
I'm trying to help you out.

299
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,171
Cover me!

300
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,431
( speaking Spanish )

301
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,270
( screams )

302
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,275
( growls )

303
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,329
Daryl! I got ya!

304
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,291
Go!

305
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,587
- ( speaking Spanish )
- Speak English.

306
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,860
( speaking Spanish )

307
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,332
( baby crying )

308
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,758
( shouting in Spanish )

309
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,343
Slow down, beaner.

310
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,138
That ain't no way
to say thank you.

311
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,016
( speaking Spanish )

312
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,188
Let 'em go.

313
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,108
Relax.

314
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,986
The least they
can do is give us

315
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,655
an enchilada
or something, huh?

316
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,408
Easy does it, señorita.

317
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,495
- ( sobbing )
- Everything's gonna be fine.

318
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,247
- ( rustling )
- Man #2: Hey! Hey!

319
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,167
( man #1
speaking Spanish )

320
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,878
( cans clanking )

321
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,882
( bottle rattles )

322
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,053
( sighs )
Get out of the car.

323
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,681
I know you're not talking
to me, brother.

324
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,310
Get in your car and get
the hell out of here.

325
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,937
Go! Get in your car!

326
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,688
( speaks Spanish )

327
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,694
( car engine starts )

328
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,988
( door closes )

329
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,660
( squishes )

330
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,673
( walkers moaning )

331
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,013
( faint thunder rumbling )

332
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,605
Merle: The shit you doing,
pointing that thing at me?

333
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,566
They were scared, man.

334
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,192
They were rude
is what they were.

335
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,069
Rude and they owed us
a token of gratitude.

336
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,821
They didn't owe us nothing.

337
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,948
You helping people out of
the goodness of your heart?

338
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,242
Even though you might
die doing it?

339
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,994
Is that something
your Sheriff Rick taught you?

340
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,203
There was a baby!

341
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,248
Oh, otherwise you would have just
left them to the biters, then?

342
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,793
Man, I went back for you.
You weren't there.

343
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,880
I didn't cut off your hand, neither.
You did that.

344
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,048
Way before they locked
you up on that roof.

345
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,675
You asked for it.

346
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,223
( chuckles ) You know--
you know what's funny to me?

347
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,351
You and Sheriff Rick
are like this now.

348
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,270
Right?

349
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,063
I bet you a penny
and a fiddle of gold

350
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,024
that you never told him

351
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,901
that we were planning on
robbing that camp blind.

352
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,153
It didn't happen.

353
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,530
Yeah, it didn't 'cause I wasn't
there to help you.

354
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,616
What, like when
we were kids, huh?

355
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,951
- Who left who then?
- What?

356
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,329
Huh? Is that why
I lost my hand?

357
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,998
You lost your hand 'cause you're
a simpleminded piece of shit.

358
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,666
Yeah?
You don't know!

359
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,252
( shirt rips )

360
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,220
I-- I didn't know he was--

361
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,430
Yeah, he did.

362
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,807
He did the same to you.

363
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,435
That's why you left first.

364
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,813
I had to, man.

365
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,316
I would have killed
him otherwise.

366
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,944
Where you going?

367
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,030
- Back where I belong.
- I can't go with you.

368
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,576
I tried to kill
that black bitch.

369
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,663
Damn near killed
the Chinese kid.

370
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,706
He's Korean.

371
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:26,209
Whatever.

372
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,587
Doesn't matter, man.
I just can't go with you.

373
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:34,175
You know, I may be
the one walking away...

374
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,346
but you're the one
that's leaving-- again.

375
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,156
Damn.

376
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,954
Glenn?

377
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,540
Glenn!

378
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,848
You're not going back
to Woodbury, are you?

379
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,310
No.

380
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,479
I'm just going out there.

381
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,398
- I'll go with you.
- I got it.

382
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,900
By yourself?

383
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,987
How can you possibly think
that's a good idea?

384
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,698
I can't just sit
on my hands.

385
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,117
You went on a simple
formula run

386
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,202
and got the crap
beat out of you.

387
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,163
- Maggie was attacked.
- Are you saying this is my fault?

388
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,914
- No.
- I did what I could.

389
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,458
I know you did.

390
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,376
So does Maggie.

391
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,253
She's one of
the two people

392
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,340
most precious to me
in this world.

393
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,259
I trust you with her life.

394
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,636
I still do.

395
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,390
This rage is going
to get you killed.

396
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,437
With Daryl gone
and Rick wandering Crazytown,

397
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,230
I'm the next in charge.

398
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,322
What are you proving?

399
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,954
( engine starts )

400
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,331
She's hungry.

401
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,127
Could you help me
feed her?

402
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,754
I want to make Daddy
something to eat.

403
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,812
Here.

404
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,364
Just keep the bottle
like this.

405
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,117
Otherwise she gets gassy.

406
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,288
Got it.

407
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,638
Here's this.

408
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,403
Hershel: Rick.

409
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,164
Rick.

410
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,172
Rick.

411
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,494
You know I wouldn't have
hobbled all the way down here

412
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,871
if it wasn't important.

413
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,333
Are you coming
back soon?

414
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,295
Glenn's on the warpath.

415
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:25,174
Smart as he is,
he can't fill your boots.

416
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,343
I'm afraid he's reckless.

417
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,305
We need you now
more than ever.

418
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,766
Well, if you're
so worried about him,

419
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,602
you lead.

420
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,772
What are you doing
out here?

421
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,402
I've--

422
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,029
I've been--

423
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,867
I've got...

424
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,911
stuff out here.

425
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,789
Stuff.

426
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,959
How much longer
do you need?

427
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:03,170
I don't know.

428
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,881
I don't--

429
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,136
Is there anything
I can help you with?

430
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,692
I saw something.

431
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,539
Lori.

432
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,458
I saw Lor--

433
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,044
I'm seeing Lori.

434
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,716
Look, I know
it's not really her.

435
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,012
But there's got
to be a reason.

436
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:58,434
It's got to mean
something, you know.

437
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,896
Was it her on the phone?

438
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,357
Yeah.

439
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,442
Shane, too.

440
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,236
And the town.

441
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,282
Do you see them now?

442
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,915
You're looking for them.

443
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,043
I'm waiting.

444
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,337
For what?

445
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,840
I don't know. Something.

446
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,053
There's an answer.

447
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,223
I know
it doesn't make sense.

448
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:39,433
Well, it does.
It can make sense.

449
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,562
I mean, I think in time
it will make sense.

450
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,064
Rick...?

451
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,941
Come on in.

452
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,360
You need rest.

453
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,615
It's not safe out here.

454
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,790
I can't. I can't.

455
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,690
Stress getting
to your man Rick?

456
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,066
Can you blame him?

457
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,235
No. Not at all.

458
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,363
In here I've seen plenty
of dudes crack.

459
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,574
But not me.

460
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,702
I got on better
on the inside.

461
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,872
Things made more sense,
you know?

462
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,415
There were rules.

463
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,877
Life was more simple.

464
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,132
Didn't you miss
your brother?

465
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,259
My brother?
( laughs )

466
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,802
Hell, no.

467
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,679
He had a real
money problem.

468
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,223
- What kind of problem?
- He didn't lend me any.

469
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,350
( both laugh )

470
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,643
One time
that son of a bitch--

471
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,979
( gunshot )

472
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,370
( gunfire )

473
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,923
Come here!

474
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,020
( gasps )

475
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,519
( gunfire stops )

476
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,195
- ( door opens )
- Beth!

477
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,741
- Here.
- ( gunfire resumes )

478
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,330
Carol, go!

479
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,815
( distant engine roaring )

480
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,953
( engine roaring )

481
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,013
( laughs )

482
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,272
( engine roaring )

483
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,822
( engine rumbling )

484
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,884
( engine stops )

485
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,845
( snarling )

486
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,822
( clicks )

487
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,918
Hershel.
Get the hell out of there!

488
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,406
( snarling )

489
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,494
( clicks )

490
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,345
Oh!

491
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,910
( shouts )

492
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,471
( yelling )

493
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,975
( shouting )

494
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,651
Come on.

495
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,837
( grunting )

496
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,469
- You okay?
- Yes, baby.

497
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,435
( grunts )

498
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,355
( panting )

499
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,864
( laughs )

500
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,126
( snarling )

501
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,709
( theme music playing )
