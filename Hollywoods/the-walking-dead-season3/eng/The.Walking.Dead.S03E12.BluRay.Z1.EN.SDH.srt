1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,047
( birds chirping )

2
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,492
Hey!

3
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,245
Hey! Slow down!
Slow down!

4
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,622
Slow--
I'm begging you!

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,210
Please!

6
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,023
( walker snarling )

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,210
( walker snarling )

8
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,925
( tires spinning )

9
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,898
( snarling )

10
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,364
( walkers snarling )

11
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,748
Cover your ears.

12
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,259
( gunshot echoes )

13
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:19,263
Yeah, this'll work.

14
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,480
Tell me when.

15
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,736
( car door opens, closes )

16
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,279
Hey.

17
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,953
Put something
under the car like this

18
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,288
with a little gravel
and sticks.

19
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,999
It gives you traction.

20
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,962
Wouldn't have to do it
if she didn't get us stuck.

21
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,214
It was an honest mistake.

22
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,637
Why'd you let her come?

23
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,222
She took you to Woodbury

24
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,015
and you said she
just split on you.

25
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,977
- And Oscar died and you guys--
- It wasn't that simple.

26
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,937
I asked her to come today.

27
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,314
I didn't want to leave her
at the prison if I wasn't there,

28
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,191
not with Merle.

29
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,903
That and we got
common interests.

30
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,284
For right now,
we have the same problems.

31
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,703
So maybe we can work
on them together.

32
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,705
Carl:
Just for right now?

33
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,958
Rick:
Yeah, just for right now.

34
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,294
Man:
Hey!

35
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,379
Help me!

36
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,299
I'm begging you!
Don't leave!

37
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,010
Please!

38
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,888
- Hey!
- ( taps car )

39
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,974
- ( engine starts )
- Don't leave!

40
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,184
Please!

41
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,520
Let's go.

42
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,023
Man:
I'm okay!

43
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,567
Please!

44
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,028
Please!

45
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,866
Help me!

46
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,368
Stop!

47
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,497
( theme music playing )

48
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,946
( sighs )

49
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,705
Damn it!

50
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,761
You got any other
police stations in town?

51
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,973
I was the police here.

52
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,933
Me and a few other guys.

53
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,602
Ain't a big town.

54
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,485
There's other
places to check.

55
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,239
May not have as many guns
as were in here, but--

56
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,575
We need as many guns
as were in here.

57
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,161
- Ammo, too.
- Yeah, we do.

58
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,330
But right now,
I only got a line on a couple.

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,792
There's a few places
out on the main street--

60
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,836
bars, a liquor store.

61
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,838
Owners had a gun or two
behind the counter

62
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,339
that people
didn't know about.

63
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,341
I did.
I signed the permits.

64
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,677
They might still be there.

65
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,099
Do you have a problem
with that approach?

66
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,272
No, Rick.
I don't have a problem.

67
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,586
( rope creaking )

68
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,102
- What is it?
- I don't know.

69
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,151
( rats squeaking )

70
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,816
It looks like someone's
already made this theirs.

71
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,485
Doesn't mean they found
what we're looking for.

72
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,323
Couple of the places
are just up ahead.

73
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,533
Let's get in

74
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,702
and get the hell
out of here.

75
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,670
There.

76
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,505
Tyrell's.

77
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,633
A shotgun
and two handguns.

78
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,261
License issued
to Tyrell Debbs.

79
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,347
( snarling )

80
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,146
Rick:
Wait.

81
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,898
She'll get caught.

82
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,654
( gunshot )

83
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,156
Hands!

84
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,826
Now you drop
what you got and you go.

85
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,163
Your guns, your shoes,
and that sword.

86
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,250
All of it.
10 seconds.

87
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,876
- Run for the car now.
- 10...

88
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,670
- Dad.
- We need that rifle.

89
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,464
...nine,

90
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,049
eight...

91
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,302
- I think I can get up there.
- ...seven,

92
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,638
- six...
- Carl, go.

93
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,848
( gunfire )

94
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,006
( gunfire )

95
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,856
- ( gunshot )
- ( groans )

96
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,788
You okay?

97
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,665
Yeah.

98
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,253
I told you to run
for the car.

99
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,964
I didn't want you
to have to do that.

100
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,632
I had to.

101
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,391
( clunking )

102
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,268
He's wearing
body armor.

103
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,318
- He's alive.
- Do we care?

104
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,080
Yeah.

105
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,051
Keep an eye out
for booby traps.

106
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,804
Looks like he's gotten
pretty creative so far.

107
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,015
I thought we were just gonna get in
and get the hell out of here.

108
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,184
I'm not leaving him
on the street.

109
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,353
Look, I know you said
he helped you--

110
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,064
He saved my life.

111
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,859
He wasn't like this then.

112
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,655
Michonne:
Okay.

113
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,703
Jesus, he has a son.

114
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,540
You think he's in there?

115
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,295
( rats squeaking )

116
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,893
Don't.

117
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,895
You said booby traps.

118
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,577
Thank you.

119
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,580
Let's just get him
inside and go.

120
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,332
( Rick and Michonne grunting )

121
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,008
Whoa!

122
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,530
Carl, watch the wire.

123
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,880
I showed him that
weapons locker last year.

124
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,840
And it had
all of this in it?

125
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,800
No, not even half.

126
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,095
He's been busy.
The cot.

127
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,575
No.

128
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,537
We're gonna wait
for him to wake up.

129
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,080
Make sure he's okay.

130
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,749
He tried to kill us.

131
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,959
He told us to go.
He didn't know who we were.

132
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,128
He tried to kill us and we didn't
leave him for the walkers.

133
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,672
He's had a good day.
He doesn't need half of these guns.

134
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,382
We do.

135
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,177
We're waiting for him to wake up.
That's it.

136
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,596
Have you taken a look
around this place?

137
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,807
The axe, the spikes,
the walls.

138
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,517
- You think he's crazy?
- No.

139
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,062
I think he's dangerous.

140
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,606
I know him.

141
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,275
He wasn't
like this then.

142
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,905
We're gonna wait
for him to wake up.

143
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,797
( restraints zip )

144
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,249
What do you see?

145
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,335
Carl:
It's our neighborhood.

146
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,595
It's gone.

147
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,849
Is that why
you wanted to come?

148
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,309
To see the house?

149
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,938
Carl.

150
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,318
I just wanted to come.

151
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,698
( crunching )

152
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,534
We're eating his food now?

153
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,204
The mat said "Welcome."

154
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,177
I'm going on a run.

155
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,138
Where?

156
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:22,142
I thought maybe the one thing
people didn't loot was cribs

157
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,811
and there's that baby place
that Mom's friend Sara ran.

158
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,772
- It's just around the corner.
- Carl.

159
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,774
Dad, it's just around
the corner.

160
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,609
And there's all
those walker traps.

161
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,402
You're gonna need some help
carrying the box.

162
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,987
What?

163
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,406
If you're gonna get a crib,
you have to get the box.

164
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,284
It's big and heavy.

165
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,454
You're gonna need help
carrying the box.

166
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,457
You are getting
a crib, right?

167
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,334
That's what I said.

168
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,795
Then I'll go with him.

169
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,009
Right there,
that's the deal.

170
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,640
You get into trouble,
you holler, okay?

171
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,601
- I'll hear it from here.
- Okay.

172
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,742
( walkers snarling )

173
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,834
You don't have
to come with me.

174
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,836
I can handle it.

175
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,004
I told your dad
I'd help you.

176
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,424
Yeah, okay.

177
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,096
( squeaking )

178
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,181
( walker snarling )

179
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,145
Guess we should
take care of that.

180
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,314
Mmm.

181
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,379
Shit.

182
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,723
What the hell was that?

183
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,601
I want to do this
on my own.

184
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,191
You just passed
the baby place.

185
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,364
I'm getting Judith
something else first, okay?

186
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,909
I'm sorry
this happened to you.

187
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,274
( casing clinks )

188
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,950
( shouts )

189
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,453
Do you know who I am?
Do you see who I am?

190
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,122
People wearing
dead people's faces.

191
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,665
- Morgan, listen to me.
- No, I don't know you!

192
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,793
- You do know me.
- I don't know you!

193
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,295
- ( groans )
- You saved my life, Morgan.

194
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,131
You know me.

195
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,383
Look at me.

196
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,468
( groans )

197
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,263
You don't clear, man.

198
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,306
You turn.

199
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,559
You just die.

200
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:35,311
- You know me.
- I don't know anyone anymore!

201
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,815
You don't clear!

202
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,401
( screams )

203
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,069
( groans )

204
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,572
You know me.

205
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,992
You crazy
son of a bitch.

206
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,994
Please.

207
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,331
Please kill me.

208
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,510
( snarling )

209
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,521
( rat squeaking )

210
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,028
Just kill me.

211
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,615
Just kill me.

212
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,533
Just kill me.
Just--

213
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,203
just kill me.

214
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,499
You found me last year
in my front yard, Morgan.

215
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,211
You and--
you found me.

216
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,798
You fed me. You told me
what's happening.

217
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,175
You saved me.

218
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,136
My name is Rick Grimes.
You know me.

219
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,806
I'm not wearing
a dead man's face.

220
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,268
I gave you this.

221
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,396
I said I'd turn it on
every day at dawn

222
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,857
so you could find me.

223
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,030
Rick?

224
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,992
I know you.

225
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,579
Oh, man.
Damn it, I--

226
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,290
I know you.
I know who you are.

227
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,128
You said you'd turn
yours on at dawn.

228
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,838
That's what you said.

229
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,341
I mean, I hadn't
worked up to it yet, and--

230
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,219
then I did.

231
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,599
On the roof
every morning for days.

232
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,060
For weeks,
me and my boy.

233
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,812
And then...

234
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,108
me.

235
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,112
Just static, though.
Nothing but static.

236
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,364
And then nothing
but nothing.

237
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,118
You weren't there.
You were never there.

238
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,828
- I was.
- No, not when I tried.

239
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,164
I mean, you said you would
turn on your radio

240
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,665
- every day at dawn.
- Morgan, I--

241
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,750
You said that you would
turn on your radio...

242
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,294
- I did.
- ...every day at dawn

243
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,172
and you were not there!

244
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,555
I kept getting--
I kept getting pushed farther out.

245
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,853
I had to.
I didn't have a choice.

246
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,814
I found my wife
and my boy.

247
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,900
I had people.

248
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,903
I had to keep them safe.

249
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,407
We kept getting pushed back
deeper into the country.

250
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:38,620
I swear to God
I didn't have a choice.

251
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,580
You can have
your radio back

252
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,875
'cause it looks like
I finally found you.

253
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:47,629
You found your wife
and your son.

254
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,089
That's what happened, right?
You found them.

255
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,014
And did they--

256
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,433
did she--
did your wife--

257
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,518
did she turn?

258
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,106
No, she died.

259
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,861
So you didn't have
to see that, then.

260
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,947
Of course not.

261
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,699
( chuckles )
Not like me.

262
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,327
( laughs )
No.

263
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:23,039
Not like me.
Not like my wife.

264
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,083
You remember
what happened to her?

265
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,587
You remember
what she was?

266
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,715
Yeah.

267
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,889
Oh.

268
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,935
You gave me the gun.

269
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,396
You tried.

270
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,564
What did I try, Morgan?

271
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,900
- ( laughs )
- What did I try?

272
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,945
You tried to get me to do it
'cause I was supposed to do it.

273
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,739
I was supposed
to kill her, my Jenny.

274
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:00,243
Knew I was supposed to,
but I let it go.

275
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,330
Let it go like there wasn't
gonna be a reckoning.

276
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,919
We was always
looking for food.

277
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,338
You know, it always
came down to food.

278
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,507
And I was--

279
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,843
I was checking out a cellar

280
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,470
and I didn't want Duane
to come down there with me.

281
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,015
And then when I came up...

282
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:27,270
she was standing there
right in front of him

283
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,356
and he had his gun up

284
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,109
and he couldn't do it.

285
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,654
So I called to him

286
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,614
and he turned.

287
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,616
And then she was just--

288
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,328
just on him.

289
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,456
And I see red.
I see red.

290
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,959
Everything is red.
Everything I see is red.

291
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,919
And I do it.

292
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,341
Finally.

293
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,844
Finally was too late.

294
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,641
I was supposed to.

295
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,270
I was selfish.

296
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,147
I was weak.

297
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,322
You gave me the gun.

298
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,620
Hey, your boy--

299
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,497
is he dead?

300
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,502
- No.
- No?

301
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,337
He will be.

302
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,297
See, 'cause people
like you,

303
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,133
the good people,
they always die.

304
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,011
And the bad people do, too.

305
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,056
But the weak people,

306
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,517
the people like me...

307
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:52,271
we have inherited
the earth.

308
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,823
You think I was gonna
let you go in there?

309
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,452
I just think it's none
of your business.

310
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,287
You don't know me.
You don't know my dad.

311
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,080
I came out here to help.

312
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,499
You came out here
for common interests.

313
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,585
We have the same enemy
and the same problem.

314
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,503
And that's why you're here.
That's it.

315
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,755
This is important.

316
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,092
I'm going to do this.

317
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,760
And I know how I can.

318
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,513
You can't stop me.

319
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,060
Psst.

320
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,190
I can't stop you.

321
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,944
But you can't stop me
from helping you.

322
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,282
( bell jingles )

323
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,118
( squeaking )

324
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,706
( growling )

325
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,049
( growls )

326
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,093
( rat squeaking )

327
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,600
- ( snarling )
- In the kitchen.

328
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,729
( gunshot )

329
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,574
( gunshots )

330
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,495
No!

331
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,792
- I've got to go back in.
- Where is it?

332
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,754
We have to go back.
We have to. I have to.

333
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,756
It's the only one left!

334
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,217
( walkers pounding )

335
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,095
- Fine.
- Not like this.

336
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,100
I don't know you.
I get that.

337
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,770
But can you do
something for me?

338
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,688
Wait here.

339
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,399
- I can help.
- No. And no more bullshit.

340
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,234
You wait here.

341
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,570
That's how we get it done.

342
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,392
Hey.

343
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,863
I just--

344
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,491
I just thought
Judith should--

345
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,660
should know what
her mom looked like.

346
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,871
Thank you.

347
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,166
I was gonna go
back in anyway.

348
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,170
I just couldn't
leave this behind.

349
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,589
It's just
too damn gorgeous.

350
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,388
I'm not going
to kill you.

351
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,144
I don't think that's
what's supposed to happen.

352
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,021
I think you're supposed
to come back with us.

353
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,357
( laughs )

354
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,693
After all that?

355
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,403
After me trying to blow
your head off,

356
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,114
stab your heart out,
happily ever after together?

357
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,741
You couldn't kill me,
I couldn't kill you.

358
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,367
I'll take that as a sign.

359
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,079
Huh.

360
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,958
We found a prison.

361
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,544
The fences
can keep 'em out.

362
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,299
Is that where your wife died?

363
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,138
Just go.

364
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,806
Don't go back.
Don't stop.

365
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,434
Just get yourself
some more time.

366
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,228
Look, I can help you.

367
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,397
You can come back with us.
You can heal.

368
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,149
You're taking a lot
of guns, Rick.

369
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:14,361
No, I'm just saying that
that all is a lot of guns.

370
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,198
Why do you need
the guns, Rick?

371
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,158
'Cause if you got
something good,

372
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,535
that just means that there's
someone who wants to take it.

373
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,996
And that is what
is happening, right?

374
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,831
- We're gonna win.
- ( chuckles )

375
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,542
You can be there.
You can help.

376
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,921
You will be torn apart
by teeth or bullets.

377
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,215
You and your boy.

378
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,884
Your people, but not me.

379
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,887
Because I am not gonna
watch that happen again.

380
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,352
Man, you take the guns.

381
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,938
You know there's a chance.
That's what you can't square.

382
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,439
That's what hurts.

383
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,733
You know there's a chance.

384
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,194
I don't think you heard
a damn word that I said.

385
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,954
We both started out
in the same place.

386
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,541
Things went bad for you,
things went bad for me.

387
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,336
But you're not
seeing things right.

388
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,463
I don't blame you,
what you've lost,

389
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,090
what you've been through.

390
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,633
You're not
seeing things right,

391
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,219
but you can come back from this,
I know you can.

392
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,973
You have to.

393
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,141
This can't be it.

394
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,103
It can't be.

395
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,480
You got to be able
to come back from this.

396
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,151
- No.
- Morgan, please.

397
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,987
No!

398
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,823
I have to clear.

399
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,908
That's why
I didn't die today.

400
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,410
That's the sign.

401
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:47,121
I have to, man.
I have to.

402
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,626
I have to clear.

403
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,278
( growling )

404
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,456
Hey.

405
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,541
I was just about
to look for you.

406
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,877
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

407
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,962
You're here now.

408
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,052
Oh, it's nothing.

409
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,058
Thank you.

410
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,907
He's okay?

411
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,286
No, he's not.

412
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,961
Wait. Hey.

413
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,505
- Carl.
- Morgan.

414
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,510
I had to shoot you.

415
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,679
You know I had to, right?

416
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,766
I'm sorry.

417
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,270
Hey, son.

418
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,857
Don't ever be sorry.

419
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,637
Everything okay with her?

420
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,099
I think she might
be one of us.

421
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,977
What?

422
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,065
Everything went okay.

423
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,484
( chuckles )

424
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,654
Hop in. I'll throw this
in the back.

425
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,680
You see something?

426
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,603
I know you see things.

427
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,354
People.

428
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,278
I used to talk
to my dead boyfriend.

429
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:09,740
It happens.

430
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,495
You want to drive?

431
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,622
Yeah.

432
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,791
Good.

433
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,210
I see things.
