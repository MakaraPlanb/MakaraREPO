1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,755
( raspy breathing )

2
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,442
Almost done.

3
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,907
( sighs )

4
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,336
Here.

5
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,681
If only we had some cab'.

6
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,058
Girls' night.

7
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,691
( chains rattling )

8
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,987
Boys are getting
restless again.

9
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,785
You still haven't told me,

10
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,913
where did you find them?

11
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,000
Did they attack?
Did you hunt them down?

12
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,420
Or did you know them?

13
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,053
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,889
Oh, God.

15
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,312
You want to talk
about it?

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,606
( sniffles )

17
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,616
Okay.

18
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,162
They deserved
what they got.

19
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,250
They weren't human
to begin with.

20
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,069
( clanking )

21
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,213
( breathing heavily )

22
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,894
( theme music playing )

23
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,734
- You, grab the .50.
- You got it.

24
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,907
The Governor wants all this?

25
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,950
- He wants options.
- Where is he now?

26
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,077
Not here.

27
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,788
- How many are going out?
- Everybody.

28
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,090
I thought there was
a deal on the table.

29
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,721
I'm sure it's just a precaution,
a show of force.

30
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,883
Milton.

31
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,718
Milton!

32
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,306
You need something?

33
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,603
What is that?

34
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,814
It's my workshop.

35
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,149
How does that help
Woodbury?

36
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,611
Excuse me?

37
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,989
This was supposed
to be a new start,

38
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,949
a way out.

39
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,701
What about everything
we talked about?

40
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,704
Beating this thing?
Clawing our way back?

41
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,374
Look, this business
with Michonne,

42
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,084
I understand.

43
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,003
But the people
at the prison...

44
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,505
What?

45
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,090
Hmm?

46
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,509
- I should move on?
- Yes.

47
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,302
Well, I will
as soon as this is over.

48
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,888
- Philip--
- Let me ask you something, huh?

49
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,600
Do you still believe the biters
have some spark in them, huh?

50
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,436
Of who they were?

51
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,937
I think so.

52
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,648
Then that was
my daughter, wasn't it?

53
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,152
Whether that was
Penny or not,

54
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,487
it's done.

55
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,408
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh...

56
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,413
it's all that matters.

57
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,796
There is no deal.
Philip's asked for Michonne.

58
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,257
Rick would never
agree to that.

59
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,051
Whether he hands
her over or not,

60
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,595
he's gonna kill them all.

61
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,598
- I have to stop this.
- I don't think you can.

62
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,010
Leave.

63
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,763
Tell the people at the prison
to get out of there.

64
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,057
In time, he'll move on.

65
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,850
No.

66
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,105
I have to kill him.

67
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,773
You'll never
get close to him.

68
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,900
They'll gun
you down first.

69
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,528
Only if they see me coming.

70
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,655
Milton, this is sick.

71
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,366
I can't just stand back
and watch this.

72
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,910
( door opens )

73
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,082
( floor creaks )

74
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,693
( whistling )

75
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,373
( rewinding )

76
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,377
( whistling on tape )

77
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,800
( rewinding )

78
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,970
( whistling on tape )

79
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,946
How can you
still protect him?

80
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,282
He doesn't give a shit
about you.

81
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,994
I knew Philip before
he became the Governor.

82
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,204
That man still exists.

83
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,164
I don't believe that.

84
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,333
Okay, so you kill
the Governor.

85
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,044
Then you get shot
and Martinez takes over.

86
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,379
What then?

87
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,299
Killing the Governor
doesn't save your friends.

88
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,180
Then I have to go back.
Warn them.

89
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,098
And you're coming with me.

90
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,808
I can't leave Woodbury.

91
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,810
You really want
to be a part of this?

92
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,604
I don't know anyone
at the prison.

93
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,774
So what?
You know Merle. He fit in.

94
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,776
You'll be fine.

95
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,529
Like it or not,
I belong here.

96
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,700
Then if you stay,

97
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,703
you can't keep looking
the other way.

98
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,043
Take care of yourself.

99
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,308
You got any other weapons?

100
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:12,987
Do you have more rounds?
What do you guys got?

101
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,738
Andrea.

102
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,116
Andrea!

103
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,996
Governor wants
all weapons collected.

104
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,789
Got to get the team
geared up.

105
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,582
I think
I'm more helpful armed.

106
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,626
Hand over your piece
and any ammo.

107
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,461
No.

108
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,255
Let's not be stupid
about this.

109
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,923
Hand over your piece.

110
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,349
You got a knife?

111
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,268
You want to frisk me?

112
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,109
I should have told you
about all this. I'm sorry.

113
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,611
I just, uh--

114
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,364
I want to keep you
separate from this.

115
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,784
Safe.
You understand?

116
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,953
Yeah.

117
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,621
I just want to help.

118
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,041
Well, you can.
Tomorrow.

119
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,044
I want you with us
when we go and meet Rick.

120
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,464
He tries anything,
you can talk some sense into him.

121
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,840
Tries anything?

122
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,217
Well, you trust them,
I don't.

123
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,803
Understood.

124
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,097
I'll be there.

125
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,025
You take this one.

126
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,318
( walker growling )

127
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,445
You need the practice.

128
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,329
Just relax.

129
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,415
How am I gonna relax
if you keep telling me to relax?

130
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,339
Wasn't even close.

131
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,257
- You want to do this?
- I have been.

132
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,428
( gunshot )

133
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,847
You're wasting ammo.

134
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,398
( gunshot )

135
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,443
- ( gunshot )
- Got him.

136
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,487
Nice shot.

137
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,532
( laughs )

138
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,118
Hey, large pack
of walkers was spotted

139
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,953
heading for the main wall.

140
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,997
Martinez wants some help.
I got this covered.

141
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,874
We're not supposed
to leave this post.

142
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,835
Ask Martinez.
I'm just doing what I'm told.

143
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,462
You got to bring him over.
We need to hear it from him.

144
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,589
- You're wasting time.
- Sasha: Why can't you handle it?

145
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,299
You're supposed
to be a good shot.

146
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,057
- What are you doing?
- Got to get out of here.

147
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,976
- Nobody leaves.
- Please, I don't want any trouble.

148
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,228
- What is this about?
- Just get out of my way.

149
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,023
- Don't.
- Relax.

150
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,818
Nobody's got
to get hurt here.

151
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,613
I'm sorry.

152
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,324
I'm sorry, it's just
this place is--

153
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,953
- I can't stay here.
- Why?

154
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,622
The Governor, he is not
what he seems to be.

155
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,000
- He seems pretty straight up to me.
- That's what I thought, too.

156
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,669
But I'm telling you,
he has done terrible things.

157
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,671
He's planning worse.

158
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,215
I've got to get out of here
and you should, too.

159
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,177
Look, you're rattled,
exhausted.

160
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,471
Just put the knife down.

161
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,849
I'm going.

162
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,148
Okay.

163
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,661
We shouldn't have
let her go.

164
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,414
What do you want me
to do, shoot her?

165
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,385
- You should have stopped her.
- Stop her how?

166
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,346
- Shoot her in the back?
- No, you did the right thing.

167
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,889
Thank God neither
of you were hurt.

168
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,308
We stand on that wall
to stop biters,

169
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,602
not keep people in.

170
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,688
This isn't
a prison camp, is it?

171
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,067
Of course not. It's just she's in no
shape to take care of herself.

172
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,402
Seems pretty capable to me.

173
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,323
She was out there
all winter

174
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,951
alone.

175
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,038
Can you imagine?

176
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,752
Now, you two had each other
or your friends.

177
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,505
She only had the biters.

178
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,801
We brought her in
and tried to help her,

179
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,302
but it was too late.

180
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,013
She'd been out there
too long.

181
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,227
Did she--
did she say anything?

182
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,732
- Like what?
- I don't know.

183
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,568
Like what panicked her?

184
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,822
No.

185
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,159
I hope this
doesn't affect us.

186
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,622
What do you mean?

187
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,792
Well, we heard she was
with that prison group.

188
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,670
I hope I didn't
complicate things.

189
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,755
No. No.

190
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,592
Um, look,
I'll tell you what.

191
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,803
Martinez here could use
a hand with something.

192
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,972
If you wouldn't mind
helping him out, I'd appreciate it.

193
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,516
- Of course.
- Thank you.

194
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,274
( door opens )

195
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,697
Is she gone?

196
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,326
They going after her?

197
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,994
No.

198
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,163
I am.

199
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,750
Oh.

200
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,627
You have a problem
with that, too?

201
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,214
Let her go.

202
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,592
Why would I do that?

203
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,677
She just wants
to be with her people.

204
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,474
You talked to her?

205
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,809
No.

206
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,063
You did.

207
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,690
You knew she was leaving,
didn't you?

208
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,901
She told me.

209
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,655
What else did you two
talk about, huh?

210
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,824
Did you tell her
about the deal?

211
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,578
Did you tell her
about Michonne?

212
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,918
She knows, doesn't she?

213
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,679
( panting )

214
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,348
( walkers growling )

215
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,775
Hey.

216
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,944
Be ready to roll
in a few.

217
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,154
Where to?

218
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,323
We're not going
after that girl, are we?

219
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,325
What if we were?
Is that a problem?

220
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,285
She was pretty shook up.

221
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,995
She definitely
didn't want to be here.

222
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,249
Look, she's on her own,
understood?

223
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,584
We got something else.

224
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,378
It's sort of
hard to explain.

225
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,714
Just be at the truck
in five.

226
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,258
- Okay.
- What girl?

227
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,135
Andrea jumped the wall.

228
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,887
On your watch?
And you let her go?

229
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,598
Hey, man, these guys
have been talking.

230
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,100
She's trouble.

231
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,060
Maybe she's not
the issue.

232
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,523
She said some
pretty crazy shit.

233
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,818
You know why?
'Cause she's crazy.

234
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,446
Hey, don't screw this
up for us.

235
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,240
- I'm just looking out.
- For you two, maybe.

236
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,492
What the hell
are you talking about?

237
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,327
We got a good thing here.

238
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,997
I don't want to get
tossed out because of you.

239
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,376
These guys are on edge.

240
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,253
They've been attacked
by that crazy-ass cowboy

241
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,379
and some chick with a sword.

242
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,756
Shit's going down
and you're making waves.

243
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,841
We just have to get
with the program.

244
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,177
I am.

245
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,429
That guy
doesn't trust you.

246
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,556
Do not screw this up.

247
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,975
Ease back, man.

248
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,020
Or what?

249
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,856
You need to shame me
in front of my boy again?

250
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,484
Don't go there, man.

251
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,069
Donna...

252
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,447
I just happened
to be there.

253
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,074
- It could have been anyone.
- But it wasn't, was it?

254
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,036
- It was you.
- You want to do this now?

255
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,663
A long time coming.

256
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,208
You guys catch up.

257
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,126
Come on, Ben.

258
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,508
Yeah, it was me.
I saved her life.

259
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,593
Right place, right time.

260
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,221
And from that moment, she was
glued to you like a lost puppy.

261
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,890
Her knight
in shining armor.

262
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,142
It made me feel like...

263
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,313
- I could have done it.
- I know you could've.

264
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,106
- She didn't.
- Of course she did.

265
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,652
She knew that.
She was just scared, that's all.

266
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,573
This ain't got nothing
to do with you or me.

267
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,868
Yo, I said five.

268
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,870
Let's go.
Fire it up.

269
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,497
We ain't done.

270
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,833
( engine starts )

271
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,420
( panting )

272
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,676
( car approaching )

273
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,199
( exhales )

274
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,246
( breathing heavily )

275
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,125
( snarling )

276
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,359
( grunts )

277
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,080
Shit.

278
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,008
( walkers snarling )

279
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,802
Sasha:
What is that?

280
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,638
Martinez:
Jackpot, baby.

281
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,682
This some kind
of extermination?

282
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,310
You could say that.
No weeding out today, Shump.

283
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,520
- The more the merrier.
- All right.

284
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,814
You got a use for them?

285
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,441
Honey, we got a use
for everything.

286
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,447
This got something to do
with that meeting tomorrow?

287
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,115
The one with the prison group?

288
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,744
Ho, ho, ho.
Get that man a prize.

289
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,580
- You're bringing biters?
- Allen, heads up.

290
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,374
Okay, this is genius.

291
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,293
Hey, kid, grab the collars
out of the truck.

292
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,295
This ain't right.

293
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,089
Didn't think we were gonna
have any problems today, fella.

294
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,882
I didn't think we'd be
feeding people to biters.

295
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,677
What do you care?
They're rats.

296
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,595
This is sick.

297
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,473
Hey, give me a hand here.
Ty, you deaf?

298
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,684
I'm not doing this.

299
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,644
They got women
and children.

300
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,145
You can't do this.

301
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,522
Fine, suit yourself.

302
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,482
We get back,
you tell the Governor.

303
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,901
He'll send you packing.
Send you all packing.

304
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,487
- There's no need for that.
- Relax.

305
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,448
We looked out for each other.
We'll do it again.

306
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,284
We'll get out of your way
if that's what you want.

307
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,619
You don't speak for us.

308
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,579
You're not sending my boy
out there again.

309
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,250
- I look out for him.
- Like you looked out for Donna?

310
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,670
( grunts )

311
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,674
- Sasha: Tyreese!
- Leave him alone!

312
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,676
Get off me!

313
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,347
Do it.

314
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,101
Go on!

315
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,773
Please.

316
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,989
Go on!

317
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,371
You okay?

318
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,584
( clapping )

319
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,419
You've all been
very productive.

320
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,421
Shump,
take 'em back to town.

321
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,965
Let 'em do some knitting.

322
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,639
( breathing heavily )

323
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,830
( engine revving )

324
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,020
( engine revving )

325
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,200
( horn honking )

326
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,236
( panting )

327
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,168
( engine revs )

328
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,093
( engine revving )

329
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,645
- ( clatters )
- Shit.

330
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,189
( engine revs )

331
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,656
( engine turns off )

332
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,824
( car door slams )

333
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,191
( clatters )

334
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:04,289
( metal clanking )

335
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,250
( whistling )

336
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,720
( snarling )

337
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,305
( fence rattles )

338
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,563
( quietly )
Andrea.

339
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,525
Come back with me.

340
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,861
Come back to Woodbury.

341
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,738
We need you.

342
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,199
We all need you.

343
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,165
( louder )
That's your home now.

344
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,962
Your people.

345
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,175
Your town.

346
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,305
You can't just leave
'em all behind.

347
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,768
Please, Andrea,
come home.

348
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,194
Suit yourself.

349
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:12,917
( glass shattering )

350
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,404
( rattling )

351
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:05,303
( whistling )

352
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,114
( shovel scraping )

353
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,343
( clattering )

354
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,743
( snarling )

355
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,675
( gunshot )

356
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,844
( gunshot )

357
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,226
( snarling )

358
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,280
( shovel banging )

359
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,035
( fence rattles )

360
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,229
( footsteps )

361
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:23,065
( snarling )

362
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:29,447
( snarling echoing )

363
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,400
Time to go home, huh?

364
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,863
Andrea.

365
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,826
( snarling )

366
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,953
( grunts )

367
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,805
( gunshots )

368
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,020
( gunshots continue )

369
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,241
( gun clicking )

370
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,576
Come on!
Come on!

371
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,550
( Governor screaming )

372
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,423
Shh.

373
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,910
Yeah.

374
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,996
Shh.

375
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,778
( snarling )

376
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,227
Did you find her?

377
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,063
No luck.

378
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,398
Just got word.
Someone barbecued the pit biters.

379
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,067
Who?

380
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,110
Got a few shit stirrers
in the bunch.

381
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,904
Tyreese and his sister.

382
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,323
Send them over to distro.

383
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,450
- Rest of the group, too.
- All right.

384
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,911
We're still gonna need biters,
so get some more.

385
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,163
You got it.

386
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,629
( door opens )

387
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,882
Sorry to keep you waiting.

388
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,300
Did you find her?

389
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,844
No.

390
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,555
Hardly made it
back myself.

391
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,851
I'll look again tomorrow.

392
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:38,148
So I heard there was
a little hang-up at the pits.

393
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,651
You got a beef with Rick,
that's fair enough.

394
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,737
But you can't be feeding
his kids to biters.

395
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,698
No one's feeding anyone
to biters.

396
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,159
Well, I saw the trailers.

397
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,579
It's a scare tactic.
It's a bluff.

398
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,958
I'd rather scare his people
into leaving us alone

399
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,419
than engaging
in another fight.

400
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,796
I'm trying
to save lives here.

401
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,925
They're just for show?

402
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,553
You know, people are more
afraid of a biter on a leash

403
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,722
than a gun in their face.

404
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,225
It's pretty effective.

405
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,980
Then why didn't your man
just say that?

406
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,650
'Cause...

407
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,694
we don't discuss
tactics with people

408
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,238
that we don't really know.

409
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,211
( sighs )
Governor, look.

410
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,464
I shoot my mouth off
sometimes,

411
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,341
but the truth is
we want to stay.

412
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:51,388
I saw red.
It won't happen again.

413
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,976
Well, I'm glad
to hear it.

414
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,365
Where did you get
the gasoline?

415
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,036
Come again?

416
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,210
Doesn't matter.

417
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,316
Is she dead?

418
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,735
I hope not.

419
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,697
Are you okay?

420
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,408
Never been better.

421
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,581
It's a real shame
about the pits.

422
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,211
You heard about that, huh?

423
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,214
I hope you find out
who did it.

424
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,801
Already have.

425
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,025
