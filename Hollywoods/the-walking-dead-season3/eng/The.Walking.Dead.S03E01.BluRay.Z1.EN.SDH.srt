1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,138
( raspy breathing )

2
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,199
( groans )

3
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,082
( door creaks )

4
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,212
( raspy breathing )

5
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,174
( crossbow twangs )

6
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,096
( whistles )

7
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,211
( can opener grinding )

8
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,770
( can clatters )

9
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,253
Psst.

10
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,614
( snarling )

11
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,926
( theme music playing )

12
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,310
15, you're on point.

13
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,770
We got no place
left to go.

14
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,523
When this herd meets up with
this one, we'll be cut off.

15
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,191
We'll never make it south.

16
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,861
What would you say?
That was about 150 head?

17
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,530
That was last week.
It could be twice that by now.

18
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,782
Hershel: This river could
have delayed them.

19
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,702
If we move fast, we might have
a shot to tear right through there.

20
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,495
Yeah, but if this group
joins with that one,

21
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,872
they could spill out this way.

22
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,540
So we're blocked.

23
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,500
Only thing to do
is double back at 27

24
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,877
and swing towards Greenville.

25
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,545
Yeah, we picked
through that already.

26
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,047
It's like we spent the winter
going in circles.

27
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,215
Yeah, I know. I know.

28
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,844
At Newnan we'll push west.
Haven't been through there yet.

29
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,805
We can't keep going
house to house.

30
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,017
Need to find someplace
to hole up for a few weeks.

31
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,770
All right.
Is it cool if we get to the creek

32
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,396
before we head out?
Won't take long.

33
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,190
We got to fill up on water.
We can boil it later.

34
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,649
Knock yourself out.

35
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,069
She can't take much more
of this moving about.

36
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,155
What else can we do?
Let her give birth on the run?

37
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,949
Do you see a way
around that?

38
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,663
Hey, while the others
wash their panties,

39
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,749
let's go hunt.

40
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,293
That owl didn't exactly
hit the spot.

41
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,258
( walkers moaning )

42
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,057
That's a shame.

43
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,007
- Watch the backside.
- Got it.

44
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,641
Hurry. Hurry!

45
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,566
( walkers growling )

46
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,449
( growls )

47
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,975
( panting )

48
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,981
It's perfect.

49
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,358
If we can shut that gate,

50
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,485
prevent more
from filling the yard,

51
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,154
we can pick off
these walkers.

52
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,697
We'll take the field
by tonight.

53
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,158
So how do we
shut the gate?

54
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,744
I'll do it.
You guys cover me.

55
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,872
No.
It's a suicide run.

56
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,749
I'm the fastest.

57
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,044
No, you, Maggie, and Beth
draw as many as you can over there.

58
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,754
Pop 'em through the fence.

59
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,881
Daryl, go back to
the other tower.

60
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,550
Carol, you've become
a pretty good shot.

61
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,136
Take your time. We don't have
a lot of ammo to waste.

62
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,805
Hershel, you and Carl
take this tower.

63
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,058
All right.

64
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,227
I'll run for the gate.

65
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,730
( snarling, moaning )

66
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,905
( shouting )

67
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,157
- Come on!
- Hey, come here!

68
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,416
- Come on!
- Hey, come here!

69
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,273
Come on!
Come on!

70
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,081
Sorry.

71
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,503
Hey, come on,
over here!

72
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,213
Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, over here!

73
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,802
( snarls )

74
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,862
( growling )

75
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,322
He did it.

76
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,157
Light it up!

77
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,830
Fantastic.

78
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,541
Nice shooting.

79
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,043
You okay?

80
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,380
- I haven't felt this good in weeks.
- Good.

81
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,965
Carol: Oh!
( laughs )

82
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,884
Oh!

83
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,887
We haven't had this much space
since we left the farm.

84
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,764
( laughs )

85
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,558
( growls )

86
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,816
( laughs )

87
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,777
Whoo!

88
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,427
Mmm. Just like Mom
used to make.

89
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,106
T-Dog: Tomorrow we'll put all
the bodies together.

90
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,899
Want to keep them away
from that water.

91
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,526
Now, if we can dig
a canal under the fence,

92
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,403
we'll have plenty
of fresh water.

93
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:03,115
Hershel: And this soil is good.
We could plant some seed,

94
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,243
grow some tomatoes,
cucumbers, soybeans.

95
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,082
That's his
third time around.

96
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,086
If there was any part
of it compromised,

97
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,964
he'd have found it
by now.

98
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,511
This'll be a good place
to have the baby.

99
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,097
Safe.

100
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,651
It's not much, but if I don't bring
you something,

101
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,653
you won't eat at all.

102
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,491
I guess little Shane over there
has got quite the appetite.

103
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,702
Don't be mean.

104
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,496
Rick's gotten us
a lot farther

105
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,456
than I ever thought he would,
I'll give him that.

106
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,999
Mm-hmm.

107
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,502
Shane could never
have done that.

108
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,339
What's wrong?

109
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,174
It's that rifle.
The kickback.

110
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,885
I'm just not used to it.

111
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,555
Hold on.

112
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,533
Better get back.

113
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,537
It's pretty romantic.

114
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,163
Want to screw around?

115
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,374
Pfft.

116
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,376
( both laugh )

117
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,002
I'll go down first.

118
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,046
Even better.

119
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,215
Stop.

120
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,929
Hershel:
Bethy, sing Paddy Reilly for me.

121
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,764
I haven't heard that,
I think,

122
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,225
since your mother
was alive.

123
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,727
Daddy, not that one, please.

124
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,567
How about
"The Parting Glass"?

125
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,903
No one wants to hear.

126
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,283
Why not?

127
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,787

Better all turn in.

158
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,401
I'll take watch over there.

159
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,653
Got a big day tomorrow.

160
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,530
What do you mean?

161
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,201
Look, I know
we're all exhausted.

162
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,456
This was a great win.

163
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,626
But we've got to push
just a little bit more.

164
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,925
Most of the walkers are dressed
as guards and prisoners.

165
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,760
Looks like this place
fell pretty early.

166
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,180
It could mean the supplies
may be intact.

167
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,516
They'd have an infirmary,

168
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,268
a commissary.

169
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,519
An armory?

170
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,895
That would be outside
the prison itself,

171
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,939
but not too far away.

172
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,734
Warden's offices would
have info on the location.

173
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,695
Weapons, food, medicine.

174
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,905
This place could be
a gold mine.

175
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,408
Hershel: We're dangerously
low on ammo.

176
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,493
We'd run out
before we make a dent.

177
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,454
That's why we have
to go in there...

178
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,416
hand to hand.

179
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,379
After all we've been through,

180
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,549
we can handle it, I know it.

181
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,055
These assholes
don't stand a chance.

182
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,912
Psst.

183
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,336
I appreciate everything
you're doing.

184
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,213
We all do,

185
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,673
but it's been a death march
and they're exhausted.

186
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,967
Can we just enjoy this
for a few days?

187
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,555
Baby will be here
in a few days.

188
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,015
There's no time
for a picnic.

189
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,227
No, but it's time
to get the house in order.

190
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,395
What do you think
I'm doing?

191
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,482
Your absolute best.

192
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,692
Don't patronize me.

193
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,820
I'm not.

194
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,780
I'm just saying

195
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,657
the baby is about
to be here

196
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,117
- and we need to talk about--
- About what?

197
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,708
Things we've been avoiding--

198
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,002
You want to talk?
Talk to Hershel.

199
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,755
I'm doing stuff, Lori.

200
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,925
"Things."
Isn't that enough?

201
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,098
I'm still here.

202
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,309
You're right.

203
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,395
I'm sorry.

204
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,970
( shop bell rings )

205
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,892
( growls )

206
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,953
( growls )

207
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,100
( gurgling )

208
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,940
Ready?

209
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,780
Rick:
Daryl.

210
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,617
Come on.

211
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,458
Get tight!
Get tight!

212
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,126
( shouting )

213
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,129
- Come on, over here!
- Hey! Over here!

214
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,818
( shouting )

215
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,195
- Don't break rank!
- We need that.

216
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,407
T! T!

217
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,827
- Maggie! Maggie!
- ( grunts )

218
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,996
Rick:
Almost there.

219
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,878
Shit.

220
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,264
( growling )

221
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,738
I can't see them.
Can you see them?

222
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,740
Back there?

223
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,791
Daryl!

224
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,053
- Come on.
- We're good.

225
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,433
( growling )

226
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,522
See that?

227
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,702
( snarling )

228
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,476
Stop.

229
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,980
Well, it looks secure.

230
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,942
Not from the look
of that courtyard over there.

231
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,111
And that's a civilian.

232
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,947
So the interior could be
overrun with walkers

233
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,074
from outside the prison.

234
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,243
Well, if there's walls down,
what are we gonna do?

235
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,953
We can't rebuild
this whole place.

236
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,788
We can't risk a blind spot.

237
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,291
We have to push in.

238
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,405
( door squeaks )

239
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,880
( water dripping )

240
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,903
( loud clang )

241
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,538
( growling )

242
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,563
- What do you think?
- Home sweet home.

243
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,982
Rick:
For the time being.

244
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,318
It's secure?

245
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,029
This cellblock is.

246
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,490
What about the rest
of the prison?

247
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,660
In the morning, we'll find
the cafeteria and infirmary.

248
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,495
We sleep in the cells?

249
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,749
I found keys on some guards.
Daryl has a set, too.

250
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,584
Daryl:
I ain't sleeping in no cage.

251
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,711
I'll take the perch.

252
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,340
Come on.

253
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,094
Thank you.

254
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,851
Pretty gross.

255
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,146
Yeah, remember
the storage units?

256
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,690
It's actually--
it's actually comfortable.

257
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,484
Check it out.

258
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,450
You find your cell yet?

259
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:26,037
Yeah, I was just making
sure Beth was safe.

260
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,207
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

261
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,084
( chuckles )

262
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,215
I'm so exhausted,
I don't even care.

263
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,763
Here, let me see.

264
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,225
What you doing?

265
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,769
Checking for scratches.

266
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:09,038
♪ It's late in the night... ♪

267
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,753

( growling )

275
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,849
What are you doing
out here?

276
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,143
I needed some light.

277
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,191
( groans )

278
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,075
Take this.

279
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,683
How is it out there?

280
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,060
Same.

281
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,687
It's quiet.

282
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,400
You're lying.

283
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:46,279
We should go
in a few days.

284
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,285
They're coming.

285
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,581
- You should go.
- No.

286
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,874
I'll hold you back. Go.

287
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,752
I can take care of myself.

288
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,088
I saved your ass
all winter, didn't I?

289
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,595
( coughing )

290
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,937
I won't have you
dying for me.

291
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,816
Good soldier
won't leave your post.

292
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,568
Screw you.

293
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,536
We'll go in a few days.

294
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,632
If we stay...

295
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,178
I'll die here.

296
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,325
( gurgling )

297
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,718
Not bad.

298
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:37,014
Flashbangs,
CS Triple-Chasers.

299
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,100
Not sure how
they'd work on walkers,

300
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,643
but we'll take 'em.

301
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,814
I ain't wearing this shit.

302
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,190
We could boil 'em.

303
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,651
Ain't enough firewood
in the whole forest. No.

304
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,195
Besides, we made it this
far without 'em, right?

305
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,032
Carol:
Hershel.

306
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,492
Everything all right?

307
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,953
Yeah.
Nothing to worry about.

308
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,045
It's the baby.
I think I lost it.

309
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,840
- You haven't felt it move?
- Nothing.

310
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,925
And no Braxton-Hicks.

311
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,678
At first I thought it was exhaustion
or malnutrition.

312
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:19,181
You're anemic?

313
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:23,060
If we're all infected,
then so's the baby.

314
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,396
So what if it's stillborn?

315
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,107
What if it's dead
inside me right now?

316
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,067
- What if it rips me apart?
- Stop.

317
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,112
Don't let your fear
take control of you.

318
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,697
( sniffling )
Okay.

319
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,825
Then let's say it lives
and I die during childbirth.

320
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,536
- That's not going to happen.
- Why not?

321
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:44,331
How many women died in childbirth
before modern medicine?

322
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,003
If I come back,

323
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,589
what if I attack it?

324
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,258
Or you? Or Rick?

325
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,926
Or Carl?

326
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,095
If I do,
if there is any chance,

327
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,930
you put me down
immediately.

328
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,768
You don't hesitate.
Me, the baby,

329
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,187
if we're walkers,

330
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,440
you don't hesitate
and you don't try to save us.

331
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,442
Okay?

332
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,618
It might have
been better if--

333
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,120
- If what?
- ( exhales )

334
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,539
I'd never made it
off the farm.

335
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,793
You're exhausted,
frightened.

336
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,419
Yeah, that's true.

337
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,634
My son can't stand me.

338
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:40,346
And my husband,
after what I put him through...

339
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,766
We've all been carrying
that weight.

340
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,226
All winter.

341
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,644
I tried to talk to him.

342
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,521
He...

343
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,065
He'll come around.

344
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,946
He hates me.

345
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,783
He's too good a man
to say it, but I know.

346
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,829
I put him and Shane at odds.
I put that knife in his hand.

347
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,540
( crying )

348
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,795
You know who doesn't
give a shit about that?

349
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,007
- This baby.
- ( chuckles )

350
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,094
Now let's make sure
everything's all right.

351
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,696
You won't need that.

352
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,865
I need you to stay put.

353
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,200
- You're kidding.
- We don't know what's in there.

354
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,203
Something goes wrong,
you could be the last man standing.

355
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,414
I need you to
handle things here.

356
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,207
Sure.

357
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,711
Great. Let's go.

358
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,436
( lock clicks )

359
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,774
( spray can hissing )

360
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,781
( shrieks )

361
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,908
( softly )
Sorry.

362
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,993
( spraying )

363
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,209
( loud thud )

364
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,465
( growling )

365
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,968
- Go back. Go back! Move!
- Walkers!

366
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,350
Let's go.

367
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,602
This way.

368
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,357
- ( screams )
- Whoa. Whoa. Go, go, go.

369
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,775
Come on.

370
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,405
Come on, this way.

371
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,579
In here!

372
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,339
- Where's Glenn and Maggie?
- We have to go back.

373
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,467
But which way?

374
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,400
Maggie? Glenn?

375
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,951
- Glenn: Rick?
- Maggie: Dad?

376
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,080
Daddy?

377
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,584
Mag?

378
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,587
Mag?

379
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,925
( screaming )

380
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,096
No!

381
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,139
( wailing )

382
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,266
- No!
- Maggie!

383
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,143
Daddy!

384
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,397
- Daryl!
- Oh, God, help me!

385
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,360
- Glenn!
- We're blocked!

386
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,196
Get back! Get back!
Go! Go!

387
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,281
- Hershel: Oh, God! Oh, God.
- Rick: Hold on.

388
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,412
Break 'em open.
Open the door!

389
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,960
Get in!

390
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,212
Shut the door!

391
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,635
You got it?
Have you got it?

392
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,303
( Hershel whimpering )

393
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,433
Hurry up!

394
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,439
Hold him down.

395
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,660
All right.

396
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,290
Only one way
to keep you alive.

397
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,835
( Hershel yells )

398
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,019
Oh!

399
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,608
He's bleeding out.

400
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,987
( whispers )
Duck.

401
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,454
Holy shit.

402
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,500
( theme music playing )
