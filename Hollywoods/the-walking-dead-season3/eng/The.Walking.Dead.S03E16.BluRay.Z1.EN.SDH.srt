1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,713
( pulsating )

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,932
( labored breathing )

3
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,314
( thuds )

4
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:29,612
I have to say
I was impressed.

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,865
You had taken a risk.

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,326
Getting your hands dirty.

7
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,958
You know, we were
gonna have those biters

8
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:45,044
for our little
Michonne and--

9
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:50,007
Milton: You were gonna use them
on whoever showed up.

10
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,718
That's right.

11
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,721
Hey, hey.

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,265
Because we didn't
have them,

13
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:00,518
you burned them up,

14
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,062
eight of my men died.

15
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,989
Now, you knew
those men. Huh?

16
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:17,785
They kept you safe,
kept you fed.

17
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,456
As long as I looked
the other way.

18
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,458
Yeah.

19
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,627
Well, it can't be
like that anymore.

20
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,507
Time for you to graduate.

21
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,097
Hey.

22
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,979
I'm gonna tell you
the secret.

23
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,442
There's a threat,
you end it.

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,653
And you don't feel ashamed
about enjoying it.

25
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,700
You smell the gunpowder
and you see the blood--

26
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,827
you know what that means?

27
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,832
It means you're alive.

28
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,837
You've won.

29
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,341
You take the heads
so that you don't ever forget.

30
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,595
You kill or you die.

31
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,521
What would
your daughter think

32
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,397
about what you are?

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,612
She'd be afraid of me.

34
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,531
But if I had been
like this from the start,

35
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,866
she'd be alive today.

36
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,464
Did you kill Andrea?

37
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,633
( Andrea gasping )

38
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,510
Milton.

39
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,471
Governor:
See? She's still alive.

40
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,057
I'm gonna need her
for something.

41
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,976
Andrea: I heard you
in the other room.

42
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,979
You don't have to lose
any more of your men.

43
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,647
Just stop this.

44
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,526
Your friends
at the prison--

45
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,404
I'm gonna kill them all.

46
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,906
People are gonna help me.

47
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,743
I had to stretch the truth
a little bit, but just a little.

48
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,414
Now they're foaming
at the mouth.

49
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:30,543
You, get those tools.

50
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,461
I'm not gonna
need them anymore.

51
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,130
Go on.

52
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,266
Careful.
Pick that up.

53
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,401
Come on! Step to.
Let's go.

54
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,201
Hold up.

55
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,955
I'll take that.

56
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,624
Put 'em down.

57
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,297
( panting )

58
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,844
You're gonna
kill her now.

59
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,099
You're gonna show me
that you've learned something.

60
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,104
Milton...

61
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,691
there is no way
you are leaving this room

62
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,318
without doing it.

63
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,571
So don't make it hard.
Just--

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,783
just do it.

65
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,497
That's it.

66
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,929
- ( grunts )
- ( gasps )

67
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,098
( groans )

68
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,269
( piercing )

69
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,523
( gasping )

70
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,694
I told you
you were gonna do it.

71
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,117
And now you're gonna die.

72
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,412
And you're gonna turn.

73
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,915
And you're gonna tear
the flesh from her bones.

74
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,009
In this life now,

75
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,594
you kill or you die.

76
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,018
Or you die and you kill.

77
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,689
( theme music playing )

78
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,678
Carl.

79
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,906
I've never seen him
this mad.

80
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,368
Even with Lori.
He just shut down.

81
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,956
He's still a kid.

82
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,417
It's easy to forget.

83
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,941
You know, Merle never did
nothing like that his whole life.

84
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,652
He gave us a chance.

85
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,590
We're ready.

86
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,389
The deal the Governor
offered about me--

87
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,934
you had to think
about it.

88
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,020
You had to.
I get it.

89
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,358
Yeah.

90
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,444
I'm sorry.
I came real close.

91
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,488
But you didn't.

92
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,288
I never thanked you.

93
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,958
For what?

94
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,670
For getting me
out there that day,

95
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,588
taking me in.

96
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,594
Well, if you didn't have
that baby formula,

97
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,638
I wouldn't have.

98
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,224
You could have
just taken the formula.

99
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,768
Well...

100
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,187
must have been
something else, then.

101
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,819
You know, it was Carl
who made the call.

102
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,613
He said you belonged here.

103
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,116
You're one of us.

104
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,420
Remember, they killed
eight men back there.

105
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,338
- ( guns clicking )
- Five here last time.

106
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,882
They're no different
from the biters.

107
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,552
They're not gonna stop
until they kill us all,

108
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,555
taken everything
we've worked so hard for.

109
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,016
We're gonna end this
once and for all.

110
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,684
Governor.

111
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,021
This ain't easy to say.

112
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,190
You're gonna have
to count us out.

113
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,526
Sasha:
This isn't our fight.

114
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,486
Tyreese: We'll fight
against the biters,

115
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,655
not other people.

116
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,158
Now we'll stay here
and defend the children.

117
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,369
When you return,
if you want us gone,

118
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,747
no hard feelings.

119
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,561
Thank you.

120
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,944
( engines start )

121
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,908
Let's roll!

122
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,078
( snarling )

123
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,864
( pops )

124
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,481
Go!

125
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,166
Governor:
Go, go! Move!

126
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,501
Martinez: Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

127
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,361
Come on, come on.

128
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,766
( can clanking )

129
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,439
Give me a flashlight.

130
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,567
Let's split up.
You take a group that way.

131
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,570
You, bring a group,
follow me.

132
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,992
( door creaking )

133
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,336
Go.

134
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,346
- Andrea: Milton?
- When the tools dropped,

135
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,724
I-I left some pliers

136
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,977
on the floor behind you.

137
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,523
If you can drag--
( pants )

138
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,694
if you can drag your right foot back,
you-- you can get them.

139
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,460
That-- that's it.

140
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:47,214
- Oh, God.
- Almost.

141
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,549
I'm gonna get us both
out of here.

142
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,885
And you're gonna be okay.

143
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,554
Now when--
when you get free,

144
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,225
you are going to find
something very sharp...

145
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,188
and you are going
to stab me in the head.

146
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,111
That is what
you are going to do.

147
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,990
Keep trying.

148
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,619
Come on.

149
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,920
( door squeaks )

150
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,975
Hey.

151
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,060
Over there.

152
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,192
- ( distant clang )
- What was that?

153
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,990
- ( clatters )
- Shh.

154
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,578
( distant clatter )

155
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,916
This way.

156
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,851
We took out a few biters
on the south wall.

157
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,271
Other than that,
everything's quiet.

158
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,190
I'll get the next one.

159
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,736
What do you think happens
when they return?

160
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,947
We might have to slip out.
Andrea made it out.

161
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,451
If she's at the prison,
it didn't do her any good.

162
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,369
I'll be right back.

163
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,288
- It's my turn.
- Stay put.

164
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,624
I got it.

165
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,838
( door closes )

166
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,341
I got it. I got it.

167
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,763
Milton?

168
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:24,246
( groans, gasps )

169
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,998
( sighs )

170
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,708
Milton.

171
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,378
Why did you stay...

172
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,342
after you found out
your friends were out there?

173
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,138
I wanted to save everyone.

174
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,561
Even the Governor
for a while.

175
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,023
I had a chance to kill him.

176
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,025
What stopped you?

177
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,486
You know,
this was before.

178
00:19:56,654 --> 00:20:00,282
He was asleep.
I had a knife.

179
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,411
But I tried to stop it all
another way...

180
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,084
because I didn't want
anyone to die.

181
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm still here.

182
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:32,272
I'm still alive.

183
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,025
Yeah.

184
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,611
You are.

185
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,782
You need to hurry.

186
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,789
Right.

187
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,834
Okay.

188
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,726
- ( explosion )
- ( all shouting )

189
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,770
( alarm blaring )

190
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:15,148
- Hold your ground!
- ( shouting continues )

191
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,484
Hold your ground!

192
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,946
( snarling )

193
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,989
( gunfire )

194
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,577
( people screaming )

195
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,961
Get the hell out of here!

196
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,674
( distant gunfire )

197
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,096
I should be there.

198
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,555
Go.

199
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,517
- ( coughing )
- ( gunfire )

200
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,522
- Move!
- Go. Go, go, go.

201
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,610
Go.

202
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,570
Move! Move!

203
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,079
Hit it, hit it, hit it!

204
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,580
- Allen: It's not working.
- Go, man!

205
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,374
Shit.
It's jammed!

206
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,002
- Return--
- ( gunfire )

207
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,921
Hey!

208
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,257
They're not going anywhere.
Come on.

209
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,554
( bullets ricocheting )

210
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,313
We did it?

211
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,940
We did it.

212
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,442
Come on down.

213
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,748
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't shoot.

214
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,459
Drop the weapon, son.

215
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,461
Sure.

216
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,088
Here, take it.

217
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,471
- ( gunshot )
- ( thuds )

218
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,443
( all panting )

219
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,948
We did it.
We drove them out.

220
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,492
We should go after them.

221
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,452
- We should finish it.
- Maggie: It is finished.

222
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,953
Didn't you see them
hightail it out of here?

223
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,789
- Michonne: They could regroup.
- We can't take the chance.

224
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,332
- He's not gonna stop.
- They're right.

225
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,625
We can't keep
living like this.

226
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:39,834
So we take the fight
back to Woodbury.

227
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,377
We barely made it back
last time.

228
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,962
He don't care.

229
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,048
Yeah.

230
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,427
Let's check on the others.

231
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,180
( door closes )

232
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,942
( Judith coos )

233
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,111
Hey.

234
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:15,120
- Hey.
- Dad, I'm coming to Woodbury.

235
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,789
- Carl.
- Dad, I did do my job out there.

236
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,666
Just like all of you.

237
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,334
Took out one
of the Governor's soldiers.

238
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,129
Hershel:
One of his soldiers?

239
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,840
A kid running away?
He stumbled across us.

240
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,675
No, he drew on us.

241
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,511
I'm sorry you had
to do that.

242
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,805
It's what I was there for.

243
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,974
I'm going with you.

244
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,895
( door opens )

245
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,982
That kid was scared.

246
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,359
He was handing
his gun over.

247
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,696
He said he drew.

248
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,701
Carl said it was
in defense.

249
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,162
I was there.
He didn't have to shoot.

250
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,663
He had every reason
not to--

251
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,123
Maybe it looked like
that to you, Hershel--

252
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,708
Rick!

253
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,714
I'm telling you

254
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,466
he gunned that kid down.

255
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:19,893
- ( tires squeal )
- ( honking horn )

256
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,853
Move over!

257
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,856
Hey!
I want this truck over.

258
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,025
Go.
Pull in front of them.

259
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,696
( tires squeal )

260
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,742
What the hell
are you doing?

261
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,827
- We need to dig in.
- Paul: It's not worth it.

262
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,871
- That was a slaughter.
- You bunch of pussies.

263
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,539
I told you we should have
handled this shit ourselves.

264
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,249
We're done fighting
for a hole with a half dozen

265
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,084
psychopaths living in it.
They can keep it.

266
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,253
Allen: You've seen what
they've done-- attacked us.

267
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,047
They killed my boy.
We're going back.

268
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,258
We are not soldiers.
Want us to kill biters, of course.

269
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,927
- But this is crazy.
- Allen: Go home, then.

270
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,303
You think you're
gonna be safe?

271
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,554
Paul: I'm going back
to Woodbury.

272
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,640
We're not here
to settle a grudge.

273
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,892
( screaming )

274
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,104
( gunfire )

275
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,135
( bird cawing )

276
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:56,030
( gasping quietly )

277
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,702
( gunshot )

278
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:13,256
( bird cawing )

279
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,471
( exhales )

280
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,294
( taps )

281
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,055
( pliers scraping )

282
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,684
Come on.

283
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,186
Okay.

284
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,897
Okay.

285
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,942
Okay.
All right.

286
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,241
You're still here.

287
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,994
You're still alive.

288
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,746
All right.

289
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,883
Shit!

290
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,821
All right.

291
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,370
- All right. Okay.
- ( soft clang )

292
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,824
Michonne.

293
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,174
Hershel told me
about the boy you shot.

294
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,093
He had a gun.

295
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,262
Hmm.

296
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,475
Was he handing it over?

297
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,938
- He had just attacked us.
- Yeah.

298
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,232
Yes, he had.

299
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,529
Was he handing it over?

300
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,036
I couldn't take the chance.

301
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:31,913
I didn't kill the walker
that killed Dale.

302
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,040
- Look what happened.
- Son, that is not the same thing.

303
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,501
You didn't kill Andrew

304
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,128
and he came back
and killed Mom.

305
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,382
You were in a room
with the Governor

306
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,801
and you let him go.

307
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,387
And then he killed Merle.

308
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,057
I did what I had to do.

309
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,187
Now go.

310
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,607
So he doesn't kill
any more of us.

311
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,484
( metal clinks )

312
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,712
Rick, we're staying.

313
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,464
We don't know
where the Governor is.

314
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,424
If he comes back,
we'll hold him off.

315
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,427
Just the three of us?

316
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,097
All right.

317
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,099
I appreciate you staying.

318
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,809
Sure.

319
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,953
Come on, come on.

320
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,147
( crunching )

321
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,649
( snarling )

322
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,633
( bangs )

323
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,760
( hammer clicks )

324
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,162
( snarling )

325
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,918
Come on.
Come on.

326
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,851
Okay, okay.

327
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,856
Oh! Come on!

328
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,198
( Andrea screaming )

329
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,576
( Milton snarling )

330
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,205
( thudding )

331
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,709
( metal squeaking )

332
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,722
( gunshot )

333
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,024
Karen:
Tyreese!

334
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,570
- It's me! Don't--
- Get down!

335
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,071
Tyreese:
Karen!

336
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,698
Karen, are you okay?

337
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:38,868
- I'm fine!
- Where's the Governor?

338
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,911
He fired on everyone.

339
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,955
He killed them all.

340
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:53,549
- Tyreese: Why are you with them?
- They saved me.

341
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,096
We're coming out!

342
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,015
No.

343
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,977
We're coming out.

344
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,416
Tyreese:
What are you doing here?

345
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,169
We were coming
to finish this

346
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:33,923
until we saw
what the Governor did.

347
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,427
Tyreese:
He-- he killed them?

348
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,680
Yeah.

349
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,016
Karen told us
Andrea hopped the wall

350
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,518
going for the prison.

351
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,561
She never made it.

352
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,440
She might be here.

353
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,359
Rick: This is where he had
Glenn and Maggie.

354
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:54,860
Tyreese: The Governor
held people here?

355
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,862
Daryl: He did more
than hold them.

356
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,968
Will you open it?

357
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,182
One, two...

358
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,896
Andrea!

359
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,406
I tried to stop them.

360
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:42,616
You're burning up.

361
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:56,088
Judith, Carl,

362
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,007
the rest of them...

363
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,718
Us.

364
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,512
The rest of us.

365
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,309
Are they alive?

366
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,484
Yeah, they're alive.

367
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,912
It's good you found them.

368
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,419
No one can
make it alone now.

369
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,631
They never could.

370
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,347
I just didn't want
anyone to die.

371
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,146
- I can do it myself.
- No.

372
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,982
I have to.

373
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,653
While I still can.

374
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,038
Please?

375
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:20,130
I know how
the safety works.

376
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,484
Well, I'm not
going anywhere.

377
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,425
I tried.

378
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,178
Yeah.

379
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,765
You did.

380
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,768
You did.

381
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,684
( gunshot )

382
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,131
No, it's okay.

383
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,679
What is this?

384
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,516
They're gonna join us.

385
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,593
( music playing )
