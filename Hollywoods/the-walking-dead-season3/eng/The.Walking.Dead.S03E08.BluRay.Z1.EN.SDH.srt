1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:06,047
( thunder rumbling )

2
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,843
( woman screams )

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,971
( rasping )

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,855
( woman screaming )

5
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,086
( woman screaming )

6
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,255
( distant walkers rasping )

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,268
- ( grunts )
- Oh, my God, Tyreese!

8
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,853
- You okay?
- Yeah.

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,354
We gotta keep moving.

10
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,065
- Where's everybody else?
- They were just behind me.

11
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,525
Is there a clearing ahead?
A place to regroup?

12
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,943
I didn't get very far.

13
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,987
There might be
a building up ahead.

14
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,239
I thought I saw a tower
past the trees.

15
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,908
- Tower? What kind of tower?
- ( woman screaming )

16
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,708
This way!

17
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,670
Come on, come on.

18
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,763
( screaming )

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,765
Mom!

20
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,065
Tyreese:
Come on!

21
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,957
Hurry! This way!

22
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,715
Come on!

23
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,967
We don't know
what's in there.

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,512
We know
what's out here.

25
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,390
Not her.

26
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,017
Don't.

27
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,812
She's slowing you down,
she's slowing us down.

28
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,022
And once we're in there,
when she turns...

29
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,483
She's right.
You gotta leave me.

30
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,361
No. Please.

31
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,196
They'll tear her apart.

32
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,989
Sasha.

33
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,201
- We can't do this.
- You wanna drag her around?

34
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,703
She's suffering.
And when she finally turns--

35
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,872
Ben's not ready.

36
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,672
- It's a mistake.
- Maybe.

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,967
( walkers rasping )

38
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,876
( theme music playing )

39
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,971
( footsteps approaching )

40
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,482
I promised Milton I'd help him
cremate Mr. Coleman's body.

41
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,983
That's sweet of you,

42
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,402
but if you're still rattled,
he can handle it himself.

43
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,738
He shouldn't have to.

44
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,365
All these people
you've brought together,

45
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,700
they're here for more
than just protection;

46
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,870
they're helping each other
through this mess.

47
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,831
Woodbury's starting
to grow on you, huh?

48
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,210
Good.

49
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,143
( door opens )

50
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,981
( closes )

51
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,869
( piano music playing )

52
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,414
( raspy breathing )

53
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,423
Penny?

54
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,014
Honey?

55
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,562
It's Daddy.

56
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,732
( snarling )

57
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,988
Hey, hey.

58
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,575
Shh.

59
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,201
Baby.

60
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,288
( growling )

61
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,081
Hey, hey, hey.

62
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,376
♪ Bye-bye, baby bunting... ♪

63
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,046
Come here.

64
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:25,718
( singing along )
♪ Daddy's gone a-hunting ♪

65
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:31,724

66
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:37,897

67
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,951
Look at me, baby.

68
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,790
Look at me.

69
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,212
Look at me!

70
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,923
( music stops )

71
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,522
( Maggie crying )

72
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,780
Maggie, did he--

73
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,281
No.

74
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,909
No.

75
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,661
He barely touched me.

76
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,545
All this time,
running from walkers--

77
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,215
you forget what people do,

78
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,135
have always done.

79
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,388
Look at what
they did to you.

80
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,725
Doesn't matter.

81
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,230
As long as he didn't--

82
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,359
No. I promise.

83
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,625
Glenn: Hey.

84
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,794
( groans )

85
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,523
( grunting )

86
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,199
( groans )

87
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,088
- ( shouting )
- ( bones cracking )

88
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,912
( whispering )
Hey! Hey!

89
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,748
Damn it.

90
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,253
All right,
we need to downsize.

91
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,008
Ain't no way we're gonna
check in all them buildings,

92
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,095
not with all
them guards there.

93
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,351
( twig snaps )

94
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,228
( mouths words )

95
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,273
All right, let's go.

96
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,820
The prison's the perfect
place to hole up.

97
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,782
What once kept prisoners in
now keeps biters out.

98
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,450
And that's smart.

99
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,454
You thinking of taking it over,
moving Woodbury there?

100
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,166
People love it here
because it feels like what was.

101
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,254
Move them to damp cells
surrounded by barbed wire?

102
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,755
No.

103
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,799
We gotta take out the group
that's living there.

104
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,385
Let the biters move back in.
No one'll be the wiser.

105
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,596
The problem is
my brother's with them.

106
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,892
Well, you'll talk to him.

107
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,145
Make him our inside man.

108
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,188
He'll get us in there.

109
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,690
We'll wave the white flag

110
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,860
like we did with
the National Guard.

111
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,363
- Nothing happens to Daryl.
- Of course not.

112
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,409
What about Glenn
and the girl?

113
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,245
Well, the longer they're here,

114
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,999
the more chance
Andrea will find out.

115
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,209
Take them to
the Screamer Pits.

116
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,717
( crickets chirping )

117
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,695
Rick:
This is where you were held?

118
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,364
Michonne:
I was questioned.

119
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,199
Any idea where else
they could be?

120
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,832
I thought you said
there was a curfew.

121
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,001
The street is packed during the day.
Those are stragglers.

122
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,878
Rick: If anyone comes in here,
we're sitting ducks.

123
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,714
We gotta move.

124
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,008
Michonne:
They could be in his apartment.

125
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,551
Yeah?
What if they ain't?

126
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,929
Then we'll look
somewhere else.

127
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:05,974
- You said you could help us.
- I'm doing what I can.

128
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,977
- Then where in the hell are they?
- Hey.

129
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,069
If this goes south,
we're cutting her loose.

130
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,238
You think she's leading us
into a trap?

131
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,490
Right now it's the blind
leading the blind.

132
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,492
Let's split up.

133
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,285
( knocking at door )

134
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,037
( keys jangling )

135
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,502
I know you're in here.

136
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,879
I saw you moving
from outside.

137
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:42,136
All right, now. You're not supposed
to be in here and you know it.

138
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,765
Who's in here?

139
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,309
Shut up.
Get on your knees.

140
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,978
Hands behind your back.

141
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,521
Zip tie him.

142
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,022
Where are our people?

143
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,607
I don't know.

144
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,109
You are holding
some of our people.

145
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,070
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know.

146
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,865
Open your mouth.

147
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,159
( grunting )

148
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,507
You are good with her.

149
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,677
- You got little sisters?
- No.

150
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,680
- Axel: How old are you, anyway?
- Beth: 17.

151
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,766
17. Interesting.

152
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,061
May I speak with you?

153
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,730
Me?

154
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,775
I'll be right back.

155
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,952
- What's the problem?
- Stay away from her.

156
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,787
Please.

157
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,998
This isn't about you trying
to repopulate the earth.

158
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,500
I didn't mean no offense.

159
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,752
I've been locked up
a long while

160
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,295
and, well,
there weren't many women.

161
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,922
You following me?

162
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,674
I mean, Maggie, she's with Glenn
and you're a lesbian.

163
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,676
I was just talking with her.

164
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,261
I'm not a lesbian.

165
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,098
You got the... short hair.

166
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,436
You're not a lesbian?

167
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,899
My, my,

168
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,985
this is interesting.

169
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,154
No, it's not.

170
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,284
( yells )

171
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,835
- ( gunfire )
- ( people shouting )

172
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,395
Let him go!

173
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,735
Okay.

174
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,906
Give me the gun!

175
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,449
Get up!

176
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,386
( Merle speaking,
indistinct )

177
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,097
Glad we could catch up.

178
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,685
Just keep looking at me.

179
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,895
I love you.

180
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,735
Man: On your feet, move.
Let's go, come on.

181
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,403
Shit.

182
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,579
- ( explosion )
- ( all shouting )

183
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,124
( coughing )

184
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,592
( gunshots )

185
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,013
Shots came
from up there.

186
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,848
- I'm gonna check it out.
- No, I'll handle it.

187
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,850
Sometimes biters get in
through the side fence.

188
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,352
There's no need
for anyone to panic.

189
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,395
Woman:
Someone help!

190
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,564
What happened?

191
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,568
Some guys came through
with guns.

192
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,779
- Governor: How many?
- I-- I don't know.

193
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,322
Well, think.

194
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,199
Six or seven guys.
I'd never seen them before.

195
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,451
Girl: Are we under attack?
What should we do?

196
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,952
Hey, hey, hey.

197
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,622
Everyone, please just go home,
lock your doors, huh?

198
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,707
We need to keep
everyone safe, okay?

199
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,668
So just get inside,
keep your lights off.

200
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,670
Come on.

201
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,673
( crowd murmuring )

202
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,174
We're under attack.

203
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,009
You fan out and you find
these people.

204
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,011
Don't take any chances,
try and take prisoners.

205
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,639
You shoot to kill, huh?
Come on.

206
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,899
Rick:
Inside, quick!

207
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,660
- Daryl: Ain't no way out back here.
- Rick, how did you find us?

208
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,787
- How bad are you hurt?
- I'll be all right.

209
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,288
Where's that woman?

210
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,999
She was right behind us.

211
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,546
- Oscar: Maybe she was spotted.
- Daryl: Want me to go look for her?

212
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,965
No. We gotta get them
out of here.

213
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,842
She's on her own.

214
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,513
Daryl, this was Merle.

215
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,432
It was. He did this.

216
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,810
- Rick: You saw him?
- Face to face.

217
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,063
He threw a walker at me.
He was gonna execute us.

218
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,566
S-so my brother's
this governor?

219
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,484
No, he's somebody else.

220
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,278
Your brother's
his lieutenant or something.

221
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,863
Does he know
I'm still with you?

222
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,906
He does now.
Rick, I'm sorry.

223
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,408
We told him
where the prison was.

224
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,036
- We couldn't hold out.
- Don't. No need to apologize.

225
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,749
Maggie: They're gonna be
looking for us.

226
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,251
We have to get back.
Can you walk?

227
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,086
We got a car
a few miles out.

228
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,755
- I'm good.
- All right.

229
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,048
Daryl: Hey, if Merle's around,
I need to see him.

230
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,675
Not now.
We're in hostile territory.

231
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,927
- He's my brother. I ain't--
- Look at what he did!

232
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,096
Look, we gotta-- we gotta
get out of here now.

233
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,098
Maybe I can talk to him.
Maybe I can work something out.

234
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,601
No, no, no.
You're not thinking straight.

235
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,644
Look, no matter
what they say, they're hurt.

236
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,605
Glenn can barely walk.

237
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,482
How are we gonna
make it out

238
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,733
if we get overrun
by walkers

239
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,234
and this governor
catches up to us?

240
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,487
I need you.

241
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,448
Are you with me?

242
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,325
Yeah.

243
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,661
( door opens )

244
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,246
- Any sign of them?
- Signs of what?

245
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,081
What exactly
is happening out there?

246
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,334
Some assholes want
what we have.

247
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:48,752
Then what are we doing
waiting around here?

248
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,379
Damn straight. Let's take these
sons of bitches out.

249
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,215
How do we know
that the perimeter was breached?

250
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,841
Did anyone
actually see them?

251
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,177
- They killed Warren.
- Killed?

252
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,639
Got up close, stuck a stake
through his neck.

253
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,140
We need patrols now.

254
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,892
Can't take chances
with these terrorists.

255
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,645
You check on our people,
make sure they're safe.

256
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,146
You want me to do
house calls,

257
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,606
make sure everyone's
tucked in?

258
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,359
These guys could be holed up
in one of our residences.

259
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,486
They could be holding
someone captive or worse.

260
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,821
Can't anyone else
handle that?

261
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,864
I've got a hell of a lot
of experience and--

262
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,366
Thank you.

263
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,243
The rest of you split up.

264
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,203
Merle will lead the search.

265
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,123
Don't you think Haley should
handle the door-to-doors?

266
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,084
I need someone with some authority
to provide reassurance.

267
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,752
I mean, she's just a kid.

268
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,129
These people have already killed
one man, beaten another.

269
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,174
- I'm good with a gun--
- Just do as I ask.

270
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,386
Sure.

271
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,815
On three.
Stay tight.

272
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,317
One, two, three.

273
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,242
Man:
Hey, over there!

274
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,244
Let's go!

275
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,248
- There they are.
- ( gunfire )

276
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,689
Behind you!

277
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,118
Go! Get cover!

278
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,329
In there.

279
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,958
Go, go, go!

280
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,127
- You all right?
- I saw them.

281
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,715
- How many?
- I didn't see.

282
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,384
Don't matter.
There's gonna be more of them.

283
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,136
- We need to move.
- ( gunfire continues )

284
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,349
One of them, at least.
Black guy, young.

285
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,310
Looked like he was wearing
a prison jumpsuit.

286
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,312
Escaped convicts.

287
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,314
- Any grenades left?
- Uh-huh.

288
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,150
Get 'em ready.
We gotta gun it to the wall.

289
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,700
We gotta get
off the street.

290
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,410
We're not soldiers,
we're survivors.

291
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,953
We'll wait them out.

292
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,247
- Once the smoke clears--
- Nah, they could be anywhere.

293
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,416
- Get off the street.
- Where are you going?

294
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,251
Get off the street.
Come on, move!

295
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,460
Oh shit.

296
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,504
You guys go ahead. I'm gonna
lay down some cover fire.

297
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,258
- No, we gotta stay together.
- Too hairy. I'll be right behind you.

298
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,346
Ready?

299
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,890
Man: Smoke!
We got smoke!

300
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,395
- Move!
- Let's get out of here!

301
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,689
- Come on!
- Keep going!

302
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,357
Oscar:
This way!

303
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,240
Come on, now.
Come on.

304
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,721
- Ah!
- Glenn: No!

305
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,109
Maggie:
Rick! Rick!

306
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,403
( Glenn yells )
Maggie!

307
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,739
- Rick!
- ( gunfire continues )

308
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,075
Maggie, come on.

309
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,127
Daryl!

310
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,921
Go!

311
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,722
( crickets chirping )

312
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,733
Hershel:
Finally got Judith to sleep.

313
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,610
How are we with formula?

314
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:10,281
We have enough
to last us another month.

315
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,161
I'll take Carol for some more
at the end of the week.

316
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,789
Your dad and the others
will be back by then.

317
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,377
We don't know that.

318
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:26,297
Right now, Judith is
the only family I got.

319
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,301
- ( woman screaming )
- What was that?

320
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,303
- That was from inside.
- Was that Carol?

321
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,806
She's out keeping watch
in the guard tower with Axel.

322
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,391
What if they came back in
for something?

323
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,851
What if they're in trouble?

324
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,394
Let's check the tower,
see if they're there.

325
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,687
How could
anyone else get in?

326
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,355
The tombs are filled
with walkers

327
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:43,857
- that wandered in from outside.
- ( woman screaming )

328
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,817
Someone else could have
done the same thing.

329
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,028
- I'm going.
- I can't let you go down there.

330
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,490
My father would go.

331
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,994
( woman screaming )

332
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,996
( door closes )

333
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,166
( woman groaning,
screaming )

334
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:36,034
( screaming continues )

335
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,952
( rasping )

336
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,292
( walkers snarling )

337
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,060
Come on!

338
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,020
Hurry!

339
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,367
- Carl: Hurry!
- Go!

340
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,535
- Just go.
- Let me take her.

341
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,663
I'll cover you.

342
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,374
Look out!

343
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,253
- You have to leave her!
- No way!

344
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,268
( thudding )

345
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,479
( thudding )

346
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,940
( snarling )

347
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,172
Oh, my God.

348
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,179
It's okay.

349
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,181
I'm not gonna hurt you.

350
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,018
Come on, come on.
That's it.

351
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,242
( snarling )

352
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,040
No!

353
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,545
Don't hurt her.

354
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,469
Look. Hey.

355
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,388
Look.

356
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,397
It's me you want.

357
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,947
There's no need
for her to suffer.

358
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,282
She doesn't have needs.

359
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:11,082
Don't hurt my little girl.

360
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,088
Please don't.

361
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,761
No!

362
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,270
( roaring )

363
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,781
Ah!

364
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,245
( yells )

365
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,208
( yells )

366
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,879
( yelling )

367
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,301
( coughing )

368
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,812
No!

369
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,981
Ow! Oh!

370
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,151
( panting, coughing )

371
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,420
Ah!

372
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,634
( screaming )

373
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,349
No!

374
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,566
What have you done?

375
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,736
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

376
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,739
- ( crying )
- Here, here.

377
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,597
( sobbing )

378
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,530
( sobbing )
She killed my baby.

379
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,242
She killed my baby.
She killed her.

380
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,044
Allen:
Oh, God! Donna?

381
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,545
Is she dead?

382
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,839
Is she dead? Baby?

383
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,721
( crying )

384
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,057
- I'll take care of it.
- ( gun cocks )

385
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,933
Whoa!

386
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,477
Whoa, kid.
Wait a minute.

387
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,896
- She doesn't have that long.
- Who the hell are you?

388
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,023
How did you get in here?
Who are you with?

389
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,816
Look, we can help you.

390
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,318
First things first.

391
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,196
No, we take care
of our own.

392
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,993
- No, Tyreese!
- I gotta do it.

393
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,162
Look, just take Ben
and lean against the wall.

394
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,331
It'll be quick.

395
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,882
It's okay. It's okay.

396
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,977
( door closes )

397
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,689
- Hey, what are you doing?
- ( keys jingle )

398
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,528
- Kid, did you just lock us in here?
- Open the door.

399
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,780
This room is secure.
You'll be safe.

400
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,448
You have food and water.

401
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,372
- Open this door.
- I can't.

402
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,249
Come on, man.
We're not animals.

403
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,543
Don't do this.

404
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,587
- Hey!
- ( bangs )

405
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,089
You can't just
leave us in here!

406
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,967
- Open this door! Open it! Now!
- ( bangs )

407
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,553
Sasha!

408
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:19,598
Back away from their door
and let the man go.

409
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,315
Look around you.

410
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,736
This is the best
we've had it in weeks.

411
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,156
His house.

412
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,745
We got other things to do.

413
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,250
We don't want any trouble.

414
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,927
- Shouldn't we help them?
- I did.

415
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,767
It doesn't look good.

416
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,978
The glass has done
a lot of damage.

417
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,938
I need to get out of here.

418
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,441
- Not yet.
- Get out of my way!

419
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,110
Can you give us a minute?

420
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,830
What the hell was that?

421
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,416
Why was she here?

422
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,085
Why were you fighting her?

423
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,879
She came back to kill me.

424
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,382
- Why?
- You tell me.

425
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,261
You knew her.

426
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,309
The fish tanks, the heads?

427
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,979
I made myself look at them.

428
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,483
Prepared me for
the horrors outside.

429
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,863
And Penny?

430
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,667
Oh, my God.

431
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,253
I just heard.
Are you all right?

432
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,713
- Your eye, is it--
- ( door opens )

433
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,844
What happened to you?

434
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,435
I was attacked.

435
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,062
Merle:
They made it over the wall.

436
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,940
I'll go after them
in the morning.

437
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,872
Get down.

438
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,793
( coughs, grunts )

439
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,048
Come on, Daryl.

440
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,342
( rustling )

441
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,890
- Rick: Where the hell were you?
- ( gun cocks )

442
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,059
Put your hands up.

443
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,604
Turn around.
Turn around.

444
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,913
Get what you came for?

445
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,998
Where are the rest
of your people?

446
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,416
They got Oscar.

447
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,001
Daryl is missing.
You didn't see him?

448
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,753
If anything happens to him--

449
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:39,006
I brought you here
to save them.

450
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,218
Thanks for the help.

451
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,972
You'll need help to get them back
to the prison

452
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,433
or to go back
in there for Daryl.

453
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,938
Either way, you need me.

454
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,947
( chatter )

455
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,136
( chatter stops )

456
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,354
What can I say?

457
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,568
Hasn't been
a night like this

458
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,071
since the walls
were completed.

459
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,868
And I thought
we were past it--

460
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:58,377
past the days
when we all sat,

461
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:02,297
huddled, scared
in front of the TV

462
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,467
during the early days
of the outbreak.

463
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,515
The fear we all felt then,

464
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,226
we felt it again tonight.

465
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,066
I failed you.

466
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,905
I promised to keep you safe.

467
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,702
Hell, look at me.

468
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,001
You know, I--

469
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:42,796
I should tell you
that we'll be okay,

470
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,716
that we're safe,

471
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,552
that tomorrow we'll bury
our dead and endure,

472
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,305
but I-- I won't,

473
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,390
because I can't.

474
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:58,228
Because I'm afraid.

475
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,397
That's right.

476
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:08,238
I'm afraid of terrorists
who want what we have.

477
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,575
Want to destroy us!

478
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,744
And worse...

479
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,874
because one
of those terrorists...

480
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,920
is one of our own.

481
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,423
( crowd murmuring )

482
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,593
- Merle...
- ( crowd muttering )

483
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:33,680
the man I counted on,

484
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,101
the man I trusted.

485
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,771
He led 'em here.

486
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,148
And he let 'em in.

487
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,280
It was you.

488
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,782
You lied,

489
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,368
betrayed us all.

490
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:09,299
This is one
of the terrorists.

491
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,265
Merle's own brother.

492
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,280
So what should we do
with them, huh?

493
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,867
- Crowd: Kill them!
- What?

494
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,203
- What you want?
- Crowd: Kill them!

495
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,338
( crowd chanting )
Kill them!

496
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,644
You wanted your brother.

497
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,355
Now you got him.

498
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,959
( theme music playing )
