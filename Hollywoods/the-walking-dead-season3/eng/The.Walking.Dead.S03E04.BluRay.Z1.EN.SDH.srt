1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,588
( footsteps )

2
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,843
( liquid sloshing )

3
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:18,351
( branches snap )

4
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,488
( groaning )

5
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,335
( snarling )

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,195
( clangs )

7
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,882
( theme music playing )

8
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,550
Okay, let's get
the other car in.

9
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,094
We'll park 'em in
the west entry of the yard.

10
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,597
Daryl: Good.
Our vehicles camped out there

11
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,432
look like a giant
"vacancy" sign.

12
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,726
Rick: After that, we need
to load up these corpses

13
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,436
so we can burn 'em.

14
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,730
T-Dog:
Gonna be a long day.

15
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,816
Where's Glenn and Maggie?
We could use some help.

16
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,235
Up in the guard tower.

17
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,321
Guard tower?

18
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,824
They were just
up there last night.

19
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,660
Glenn! Maggie!

20
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,290
( door clicks )

21
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,876
Hey, what's up, guys?

22
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,378
( laughs )

23
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,589
- You coming?
- What?

24
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,551
- ( all chuckle )
- Daryl: You comin'?

25
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,681
Daryl: Come on,
we could use a hand.

26
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,683
Yeah, we'll be
right down.

27
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,979
So gross.

28
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,358
Hey, Rick.

29
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,122
Come with me.

30
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,921
Rick:
That's close enough.

31
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,342
- We had an agreement.
- Please, mister. We know that.

32
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,680
We made a deal.
But you gotta understand...

33
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,224
we can't live in that place
another minute.

34
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,476
You follow me?
All the bodies--

35
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,604
people we knew.

36
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,690
Blood, brains everywhere.
There's ghosts.

37
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,066
Why don't you
move the bodies out?

38
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,985
You should be burning them.

39
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,362
We tried. We did.

40
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,866
The fence is down on
the far side of the prison.

41
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,869
Every time we drag a body out,
those things just line up.

42
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,038
Dropping the body
and just running back inside.

43
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,625
Look, we had nothing to do
with Tomas and Andrew.

44
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,959
Nothing.

45
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,046
You trying to prove a point?
You proved it, bro.

46
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,590
We'll do whatever it takes
to be part of your group.

47
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,800
Just please, please...

48
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,554
don't make us
live in that place.

49
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,806
Our deal is nonnegotiable.

50
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,435
You either live in your cell block,
or you leave.

51
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,354
( sighs )

52
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,857
I told you this was
a waste of time.

53
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,693
They ain't no different than
the pricks who shot up our boys.

54
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,737
You know how many
friends' corpses

55
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,948
we had to drag out
this week?

56
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,200
Just threw 'em out, like.

57
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,078
Humph.
These were good guys.

58
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,413
Good guys who had our backs

59
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,707
against the really bad
dudes in the joint,

60
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,294
like Tomas and Andrew.

61
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,090
We've all made mistakes
to get in here, chief.

62
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,634
And I'm not gonna
pretend to be a saint,

63
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,595
but believe me...

64
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,972
we've paid our due--

65
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,599
enough that we would
rather hit that road

66
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,560
than to go back
into that shithole.

67
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,032
C'mon, dude.

68
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,954
Rick:
Are you serious?

69
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,790
You want them living
in a cell next to you?

70
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,418
They'll just be waiting
for a chance to grab our weapons.

71
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,670
You want to go back
to sleeping with one eye open?

72
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,797
I never stopped.

73
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,174
Bring them into the fold.

74
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,552
If we send them off packing, we might
as well execute them ourselves.

75
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,304
I don't know.
Axel seems a little unstable.

76
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,681
Carol: After all we've
been through?

77
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,599
We fought so hard
for all this,

78
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,268
what if they
decide to take it?

79
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,477
Maggie:
It's just been us for so long.

80
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,813
They're strangers.
I don't--

81
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,357
it feels weird all of a sudden
having other people around.

82
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,819
You brought us in.

83
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,779
Yeah, but you turned up with
a shot boy in your arms.

84
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,573
Didn't give us a choice.

85
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,491
They can't even kill walkers.

86
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,702
They're convicts,
bottom line.

87
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,329
Those two might actually have less
blood on their hands than we do.

88
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,290
I get guys like this.

89
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,375
Hell, I grew up with them.

90
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,419
They're degenerates,
but they ain't psychos.

91
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,046
I could have been
in there with them

92
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,339
just as easy as I'm out here
with you guys.

93
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,593
- So are you with me?
- Hell, no.

94
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,595
Let 'em take their chances
out on the road

95
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,181
- just like we did.
- What I'm saying, Daryl--

96
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,683
When I was a rookie,
I arrested this kid.

97
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,771
19 years old,
wanted for stabbing his girlfriend.

98
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,898
The kid blubbered
like a baby

99
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,609
during the interrogation,
during the trial--

100
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,861
suckered the jury.

101
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,238
He was acquitted
due to insufficient evidence

102
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,615
and then,
two weeks later,

103
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:51,368
shot another girl.

104
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,997
We've been through
too much.

105
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,708
Our deal with them stands.

106
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,384
( truck engine revving,
faint digging )

107
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,515
( people chatting )

108
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,400
Pretty amazing.

109
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,488
We find more ammo, we could cut
down a whole pack of biters.

110
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,119
I hear you and Andrea
are leaving today.

111
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,954
That's a shame.

112
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,582
We could use
a soldier like you.

113
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,920
You seem like
you're holding your own.

114
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,424
Even the National Guard
was overrun.

115
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,427
No amount of training can prepare
you for the world today.

116
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,767
You'd think one soldier
would drive away--

117
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,812
especially against
something so slow.

118
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,566
Those men were heroes.

119
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,777
Not the kind to leave
anyone behind.

120
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,159
If only we'd
gotten there sooner...

121
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,370
and you were with us.

122
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,959
Lots of bullet holes.

123
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,172
You think biters figured out
how to use weapons?

124
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,596
They must have
encountered bandits weeks ago.

125
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,849
It's ugly out there,
but then...

126
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,143
you know that
better than anyone.

127
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,687
It's too bad
what happened to Wells.

128
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,983
It is.

129
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,528
Dr. Stevens
couldn't revive him.

130
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,739
Merle put a bullet
in his brain.

131
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,366
No funeral?

132
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,326
We cremated him, quietly.

133
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,288
These people
have been through so much,

134
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,541
I figured, thank God,
at least no one knew him.

135
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,048
Thank God.

136
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,558
Rick: Move the cars
to the upper yard.

137
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,769
Point 'em facing out.

138
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,772
They'll be out of the way but ready
to go if we ever need to bail.

139
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,943
We'll give the prisoners

140
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,363
a week's worth of supplies
for the road.

141
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,532
Might not last a week.

142
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,409
It's their choice.

143
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,910
Did they really
have one?

144
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,704
Hey, hey--

145
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,747
whose blood would you
rather have on your hands--

146
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,584
Maggie's, Glenn's,
or theirs?

147
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,587
- Neither.
- ( car engine starts )

148
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,846
Twin cylinder.
Is that a Triumph?

149
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,515
Don't even look at it.

150
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,436
- Didn't want to bore it out?
- ( motor revs )

151
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,479
Sounds like
it could use a tune-up.

152
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,773
I'm pretty handy
with a wrench.

153
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,778
Heads are leakin'.
I know my bikes!

154
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,864
Man, will you
just stop?

155
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,408
Have some balls.

156
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,285
Just sayin'.

157
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,128
( door opens )

158
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,472
All right.

159
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,232
Just take your time.

160
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,694
Daddy, don't
push yourself.

161
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,114
( chuckles )
What else am I going to do?

162
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,449
I can't stand
looking up

163
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,826
at that bottom
of that bunk any longer--

164
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,661
Whoa.

165
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,708
( tapping )

166
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,217
You know, I think
I'm pretty steady.

167
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,555
That's a good start.

168
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,182
Want to take a rest?

169
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,226
Rest?
( chuckles )

170
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,479
Let's go for a little stroll.

171
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,526
If we leave soon,

172
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,820
we'll got a few hours
on the road before dusk.

173
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,780
Where are we heading?

174
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,198
I'm thinking the coast.

175
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,200
We have the water
completely on one side,

176
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,203
maybe we find a boat.

177
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,039
Best thing we can do
is find an island.

178
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,417
And if the coast
isn't safe?

179
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,962
Keep moving.

180
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,713
Let's say
the coast is safe.

181
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,550
Then what do we do?
Just grow old,

182
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,636
live off the sea
by ourselves?

183
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,222
I'd rather take my chances out
there than stay here.

184
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,767
Because your gut tells you there's
something off about this place--

185
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,936
about the Governor?

186
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,065
It's kept us alive
this long.

187
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,943
That's true.

188
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,662
There's enough food in there
to last you guys a week.

189
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,415
Cut you loose
when we get back.

190
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,459
Thank you, bro.

191
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,129
Sit tight.

192
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,093
Oscar:
"Thank you, bro"?

193
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,102
( engine starts )

194
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,689
- Glenn: Should I take her out?
- Rick: No.

195
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,901
If that armory hadn't been picked
clean, we could spare the ammo.

196
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,403
I'll start making runs.
The sooner the better.

197
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,739
We'll throw as much wood
as we can in the dog run.

198
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,199
Won't the fire
attract more walkers?

199
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,408
Maybe we should
bury them.

200
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,118
We're behind the fence.

201
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,245
It's worth the one-time risk to get rid
of the bodies for good.

202
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,582
I don't want to be planting crops
in walker-rotted soil.

203
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,390
Got you here
if you need it.

204
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,518
Just take your time
on these steps.

205
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,978
Ooh, ooh.

206
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,028
Hershel: You cleared
all those bodies out?

207
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,781
It's starting to look like a place
we could really live in.

208
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:26,990
Hey, you watch
your step.

209
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,492
Last thing we need
is you falling.

210
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,164
Looky here.

211
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,545
He is one tough
son of a bitch.

212
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,172
( chuckles )

213
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,924
- All right, Hershel!
- Shh!

214
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,551
Keep your
cheers down.

215
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,053
( growling )

216
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,223
Oh man, can't we just have
one good day?

217
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:56,019
You're doing great, Daddy.

218
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,688
Ready to race, Hershel?

219
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,856
Give me another day.

220
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,317
- I'll take you on.
- ( Carl chuckles )

221
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,533
Grab the rest of these bodies,
we can go ahead and take 'em down.

222
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,076
( chuckles )

223
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,521
- ( growling )
- Walkers! Look out!

224
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,652
No!

225
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,282
( walkers snarling )

226
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,034
( gunfire )

227
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,287
Rick:
Get out!

228
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,081
Get out of there!
Now!

229
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,168
Lori!

230
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,670
( growling )

231
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,434
Go!
Come in here!

232
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,773
Daddy, behind you!

233
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,075
The lock-- hurry up!

234
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,701
The lock!

235
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,746
Keys!

236
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,123
That gate is open!

237
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,004
Lori! Here!

238
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,849
Come on!

239
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,986
- ( snarling )
- This way.

240
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,498
Get out of my way!

241
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,334
Daryl: Come on.
Come on, come on!

242
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,265
Axel:
Hey, bro, what about us?

243
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,558
( growls )

244
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,810
( screams )

245
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,520
No!

246
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,940
Come on!

247
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,861
Hurry!

248
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,331
I circled where you can find that
farm I was staying at with Daryl.

249
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,712
Oh, yeah, you were
right off Route 9

250
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,715
right before it becomes
Dahlonega Highway.

251
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,717
And you're saying
that the farmhouse

252
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,136
is only about a day's
walk from there?

253
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,221
Give or take.

254
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,182
This is where
we looked for Sophia.

255
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,018
Even made it
up around here.

256
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,899
How come
we never hooked up?

257
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,569
You called me
a whore...

258
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,237
and a rugmuncher.

259
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,199
( chuckles )
Got a way with words, don't I?

260
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,076
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

261
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,371
Why are you
doing this?

262
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,544
I'd want the same thing
if it was my family out there.

263
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,882
Sure you don't
wanna come with me?

264
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,593
You ain't curious
about the old gang?

265
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,931
Oh...!

266
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,934
Oh yeah, you really was
cut loose, weren't you?

267
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,769
I'm sure they came back.

268
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,604
I didn't stick around
to find out.

269
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,941
Ain't that
a big ol' pig sack?

270
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,111
We got something
in common, blondie.

271
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,906
We got left behind
by the same people...

272
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,742
and saved by another.

273
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:26,331
Have you ever thought about
leaving this place?

274
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,542
( sighs )

275
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,378
Never had a reason to.

276
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,130
So the Governor
is a good man?

277
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,843
Let me just
put it this way--

278
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,554
I wasn't in the best
of shape when he found me.

279
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,349
He should have
just kept on going.

280
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,978
Yeah, he's a good man.

281
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,862
Let's go. Pull it!

282
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,989
( snarling )

283
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,284
- What the hell happened?
- Beth: The gate was open!

284
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,827
Where's Lori, Carl--
everyone else?

285
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,246
Maggie led Lori and Carl
into C block.

286
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,831
- Beth: But T was bit!
- Anyone else?

287
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,499
- Beth: I couldn't tell.
- Stay put.

288
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,669
( gurgles )

289
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,508
Those chains didn't
break on their own.

290
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,760
Someone took an ax
or cutters to 'em.

291
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,889
( walkers growling )

292
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,183
- You think they did it?
- Who else?

293
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,894
( alarm blaring )

294
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,855
What's that?

295
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,566
Oh-- you gotta be
kidding me!

296
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,654
( blaring continues )

297
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,364
Daryl!

298
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,410
( Hershel yelling )
Kill it!

299
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,872
( snarling )

300
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,916
Back up!

301
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,544
How the hell
can this be happening?!

302
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,713
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
It has to be the backup generators.

303
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,214
Well, how do you
turn those on?

304
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,884
There's three that's connected
to a diesel tank, okay?

305
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,677
Each one controls a certain
part of the prison.

306
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,679
The hacks shut 'em all off
when the prison was overrun.

307
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,890
Can someone open up
the main gates electronically

308
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,142
- with full power?
- I only worked in there a few days.

309
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,936
I guess it might
be possible.

310
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,939
- Come with us!
- Glenn: Let's go!

311
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,109
T-Dog:
There's a set of double doors

312
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,402
that will lead
to a corridor

313
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,862
that'll get you back
to our cell block.

314
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,572
- Carol: You should stop.
- I'm getting you there!

315
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,367
- Stop!
- Why? Sit here and wait to die?

316
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,994
I'll do what I have to. You're not
becoming one of those things.

317
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,706
- I can't ask that.
- It's the pact, remember?

318
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,792
This is God's plan.

319
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,961
He'll take care of me.
Always has.

320
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,630
He's gonna help me
lead you out of these tunnels.

321
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,716
( alarm blaring continues )

322
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,892
( grunts )

323
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,477
- Can you keep up?
- Lori: Something's not right.

324
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,980
- Carl: Are you bit?
- Lori: No, no, no.

325
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,107
I think
the baby's coming.

326
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,776
- Mom?
- ( walkers snarling )

327
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,945
No, there's no time.
Turn back.

328
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,447
( snarling continues )

329
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,576
( Lori grunting,
coughing )

330
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,287
( growling )

331
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,964
In here!

332
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,636
( thumps )

333
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,181
( grunts )

334
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,604
( alarm blaring
continues )

335
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,818
( panting )

336
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,449
( alarm continues )

337
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,743
( growling )

338
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,163
( gasps )

339
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,637
( ball clatters )

340
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,654
( whistles )
Pretty good.

341
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,282
We should visit
Augusta.

342
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,618
Take only the women
and let them play.

343
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,620
It'll be historic.

344
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,914
And break decades
of tradition?

345
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,666
Absolutely.

346
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,126
- Merle: I don't know.
- ( faint thump )

347
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,962
Some things are
worth holding on to.

348
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,218
You know, I was thinking
of taking Tim and Martinez

349
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,220
out on a scouting mission
later on this week.

350
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,389
For what?

351
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,600
Blondie.

352
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,353
She said my brother
was still alive.

353
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,108
Eight months ago.

354
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,944
You can track
with the best of 'em,

355
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,279
but it's like
a needle in a haystack.

356
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,950
She told me where I could find
that farmhouse

357
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,202
they were holed up in.

358
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,373
He could be anywhere.

359
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,584
I know my brother.

360
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,587
If he's out there,
I'll be able to find him.

361
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,427
What if someone gets hurt
during this search, huh?

362
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,389
What almost happened
to Crowley last time.

363
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,102
Then I'll go on my own.

364
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,897
I get what you're feeling,
I really do,

365
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,525
but I can't risk it.
I need you here.

366
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,946
This whole place
would fall apart without you.

367
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,367
This is my brother.

368
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,831
Tell you what, huh?

369
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,710
You get more concrete information,
I'll go with you myself.

370
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,046
All right?

371
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,346
( gunshot,
alarm blaring )

372
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,808
Lori!

373
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,269
Carl!

374
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,148
We just took down
five of 'em in there.

375
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:28,776
There were four in here,
but no sign of Lori or any of them.

376
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,155
They must have been pushed back
into the prison.

377
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,824
Somebody
is playing games!

378
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,659
We'll split up
and look for the others.

379
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,745
Whoever gets to the generators
first, shut 'em down!

380
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,246
Let's go!

381
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,251
( grunts )
What are those alarms?

382
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,587
Don't worry about it.

383
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,757
- What if it attracts them?
- ( Lori panting )

384
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:53,343
- Lori, let's lay you down.
- No-- the baby's coming now.

385
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,595
We have to get back to our cell block
and have Hershel help.

386
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,096
Maggie: We can't risk getting
caught out there.

387
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,182
You're gonna need to give birth
to this baby here.

388
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,684
Great.
( panting )

389
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,311
What is she doing?
Can't she breathe?

390
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,855
She's fine. Come here--
let's get your pants off.

391
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,650
- ( buckle rattles )
- Okay.

392
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,319
( Lori grunts )
Okay.

393
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,658
You're gonna need to help deliver your
brother or sister. You up for it?

394
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,621
I'll do an exam.
Let me see if you're dilated.

395
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,707
- Okay.
- Do you know how?

396
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,626
Dad taught me, but trust me,
it's my first time.

397
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:30,088
( grunts )

398
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,423
- I can't tell.
- I gotta push.

399
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,342
I gotta push.

400
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,970
( grunts, huffs )

401
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,722
Whew... whew...

402
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,184
( grunting )

403
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,020
Somebody!

404
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,064
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Maggie: Okay.

405
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,900
You're doing great, Lori.
Just keep doing it.

406
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,945
Your body knows what to do.
Let it do all the work.

407
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,032
( Lori yelps )

408
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,577
- You're doing great.
- ( breathing heavily )

409
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,580
( grunts )

410
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,457
Lori, sopt, don't push.
Something's wrong.

411
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,584
( screams )

412
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,300
T-Dog:
We're almost there.

413
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,428
( snarling )

414
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,847
( gun clicking )

415
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,724
Oh, shit.
Go back!

416
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,475
- No. We're close. We're close!
- No!

417
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,562
( yells )

418
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,441
Go! Go!

419
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:35,111
Go! Get out!

420
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,449
Go! I'm dead!
( screams )

421
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,292
( bottles clink )

422
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,627
Sorry to see you leave.

423
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,173
This place
isn't for everybody.

424
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,259
Thank you...
for everything.

425
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,304
Where are you
planning to go?

426
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,306
The coast.

427
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,767
Michonne thinks
it'll be safer.

428
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,730
What do you think?

429
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,110
Well, her vigilance
has kept you both alive.

430
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,362
( stopper pops )

431
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,156
Oh-- I haven't had
hard liquor in a while.

432
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,992
My tolerance is probably
close to nil.

433
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,286
Lucky you.

434
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,038
Merle told me you
provided information

435
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,831
about his brother's
whereabouts.

436
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,460
What I could.
It wasn't much.

437
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,629
Well, it's given him hope.

438
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,173
If you ask me,
I don't think he'll find him.

439
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,467
- But he's gotta look--
- Governor: Gotta look.

440
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,636
( chuckles )

441
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,352
What about you?

442
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,145
Think you'll find
what you're looking for?

443
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:55,650
- I'm sorry?
- You still got family out there?

444
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,821
I lost my family.

445
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,865
My parents,
my sister.

446
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,870
I'm sorry.

447
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,998
Lost my wife--
car accident.

448
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,418
18 months
before all this.

449
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,172
Just my daughter and me.

450
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,221
To better days.

451
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,980
( chuckles )

452
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,149
( clinks )

453
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,072
Ahh.
This is good.

454
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:50,413
Truth is, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

455
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,915
For the longest time,
it was all about survival.

456
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,876
Nothing else mattered.

457
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,253
So much so...

458
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,673
I don't know
what matters now.

459
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,092
Pay off the car,

460
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,887
work 50 hours a week,
get married,

461
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:10,141
buy a house-- that was survival
for many not long ago.

462
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,393
A lot's changed.

463
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,315
The scenery has.

464
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:20,610
The landscape.

465
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,196
But the way
we think...

466
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,580
I better go.

467
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,373
But I appreciate
the drink.

468
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,001
Sure.

469
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,630
Merle will see you out and he'll have
your weapons waiting for you.

470
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,176
Remember--

471
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,470
if it gets tough
out there,

472
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,555
you're always
welcome here.

473
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,807
That's very kind.

474
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,393
- Thank you, Governor.
- Philip.

475
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,479
I thought you never
told anybody your name.

476
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,856
Someone recently told me
never to say never, so...

477
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,816
( chuckles )

478
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,194
Well...

479
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,488
take care.

480
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,496
Goodbye.

481
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,095
( walkers growling,
snarling )

482
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:31,597
Rick:
Daryl, get the door!

483
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,356
How do you
shut these down?!

484
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,192
Go help him.
I got it.

485
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,486
Right here.

486
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,283
( yelling )

487
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,492
( grunts )

488
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,375
( groaning )

489
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,052
( gunshot )

490
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:40,583
Shoot him!
We can take back this prison.

491
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,297
What you waiting for?
Do it!

492
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,424
It's our house.
Shoot him!

493
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,400
( alarm continues )

494
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,200
( generator whirrs down )

495
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,785
( alarms stop )

496
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,328
Let's go.

497
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,707
Mom...?

498
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,709
Mom, look at me, look at me.
Keep your eyes open.

499
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,503
We have to get you
back to Dad.

500
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,088
I'm not gonna make it.

501
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,422
Lori, with all this blood,

502
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,965
I don't even think
you're fully dilated yet.

503
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,509
No amount of pushing
is gonna help.

504
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:36,097
I know what it means,
and I'm not losing my baby.

505
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,807
You've got to cut me open.

506
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,728
- No. I can't.
- You don't have a choice.

507
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,147
- I'll go for help.
- No!

508
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,151
Carol's the one
that practiced that.

509
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,903
Dad only taught me
the steps, Lori. If I--

510
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,030
- Please.
- I have no anesthetic,

511
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,157
- no equipment--
- Carl has a knife.

512
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,953
You won't survive.

513
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,830
My baby has to survive.

514
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,707
Please.

515
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,043
My baby...
for all of us.

516
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,338
Please, Maggie!
Please!

517
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:13,175
( Lori gasping )

518
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,469
Please.

519
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,184
I thought
we had an agreement.

520
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,395
We can always leave tomorrow
or the following day.

521
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,188
The following day?

522
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,107
We don't want to walk into trouble
that we can't get out of.

523
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:31,485
- Tell me about it.
- Michonne, it is just a day or two.

524
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:35,197
I heard you
the first time.

525
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,494
( door opens, closes )

526
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:45,249
Lori: You see my old
C-section scar?

527
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,501
- I can't.
- You can.

528
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,546
You have to.

529
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,882
Carl?

530
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,384
Baby, I don't want you
to be scared, okay?

531
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,012
This is what I want.
This is right.

532
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,098
Now you-- you take care
of your daddy for me, all right?

533
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,559
And your little brother
or sister, you take care--

534
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:04,935
You don't
have to do this.

535
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,062
You're gonna be fine.

536
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,565
You are gonna beat this world.
I know you will.

537
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,692
You are smart,
and you are strong,

538
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,571
and you are so brave,
and I love you.

539
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,073
I love you too.

540
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,328
You gotta do
what's right, baby.

541
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,875
You promise me,
you'll always do what's right.

542
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,586
It's so easy to do the wrong thing
in this world.

543
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,758
So don't--

544
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:39,887
so if it feels wrong,
don't do it, all right?

545
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,680
If it feels easy,
don't do it.

546
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,183
Don't let the world
spoil you.

547
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,938
You're so good.

548
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:55,486
You're my sweet boy.

549
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:59,281
You're the best thing I ever did.
And I love you.

550
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,117
( sobs )
I love you.

551
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:06,914
You're my sweet, sweet boy.
I love you.

552
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,917
( sobs )

553
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,629
Okay--
okay, now.

554
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,173
Okay.
( grunts )

555
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,634
Maggie, when this is over,
you're gonna have to--

556
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,303
You have to do it.
It can't be Rick.

557
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,643
All right... all right.

558
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,063
It's all right.
It's all right.

559
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,314
Whew...

560
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:44,326
Whew.
Good night, love.

561
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,748
I'm sorry.

562
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,793
( screams )

563
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,672
You're killing her!

564
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,508
( shudders )

565
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,847
Carl, give me
your hands.

566
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,557
Carl, please.

567
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,017
You should keep
the site clean, okay?

568
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,519
If I cut too deep,
I'm gonna cut the baby.

569
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,902
Good, come on.

570
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,321
I see it.
I see the ears.

571
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,031
I'm gonna pull it out.

572
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,535
I can't tell if
this is the arm or the leg.

573
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,622
Okay, I'm gonna
pull the baby out.

574
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,126
Okay...

575
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,404
- ( infant cries )
- ( Carl gasps )

576
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,243
( crying )

577
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:18,045
- We have to go.
- We can't just leave her here.

578
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,464
She'll turn.

579
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:26,553
- No.
- Carl...

580
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,765
She's my mom.

581
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,434
( crying )

582
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,739
( sobbing )

583
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,452
Rick's voice:
No more kid stuff.

584
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,371
People are gonna die.

585
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,790
I'm gonna die...

586
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,793
Mom...

587
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,797
There's no way
you can ever be ready for it.

588
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,299
( sobs )

589
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,061
( snarling )

590
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,027
( gunshot echoes )

591
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,059
( walkers snarling )

592
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,029
( growling )

593
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,698
( gunshots )

594
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,232
- Hershel!
- You didn't find them?

595
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,234
Glenn: We thought maybe
they came back out here.

596
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,739
- What about T? Carol?
- They didn't make it.

597
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,951
That doesn't mean the others didn't.
We're going back.

598
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,078
- Daryl and Glenn, you come with--
- ( infant crying )

599
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,610
( sobs )

600
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:35,325
Where-- where is she?
Where is she?

601
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,080
No... Rick, no!

602
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,918
( sobs )

603
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,424
Oh, no. No!

604
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,679
( sobs )
No!

605
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,812
( sobs )

606
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,487
Oh!
( stammers )

607
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,408
( sobbing )
