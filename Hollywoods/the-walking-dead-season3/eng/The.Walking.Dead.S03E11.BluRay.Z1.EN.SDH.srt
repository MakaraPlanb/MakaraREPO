1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,296
- Rick: We're not leaving.
- Hershel: We can't stay here.

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,090
Maggie:
What if there's another sniper?

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,716
A wood pallet won't stop one
of those rounds.

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,885
- Beth: We can't even go outside.
- Carol: Not in the daylight.

5
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,388
Glenn: Rick says we're not running,
we're not running.

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,349
No, better to live like rats.

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,393
You got a better idea?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,687
Yeah, we should have slid
out of here last night

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,563
and lived to fight
another day.

10
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,191
But we lost
that window, didn't we?

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,194
I'm sure he's got scouts on every road
out of this place by now.

12
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,446
We ain't scared
of that prick.

13
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,407
Merle:
Y'all should be.

14
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,742
That truck through
the fence thing,

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,078
that's just him
ringing the doorbell.

16
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,997
We might have some thick
walls to hide behind,

17
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,583
but he's got the guns
and the numbers.

18
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,086
And if he takes the high ground
around this place,

19
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:49,590
shoot, he could just starve
us out if he wanted to.

20
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,176
Let's put him
in the other cell block.

21
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,220
No. He's got a point.

22
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,305
This is all you.
You started this.

23
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,766
What difference whose fault it is?
What do we do?

24
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,518
I said we should leave.

25
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,770
Now Axel's dead.

26
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,356
We can't just sit here.

27
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,278
( yells )
Get back here!

28
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,616
You're slipping, Rick.

29
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,286
We've all seen it.
We understand why.

30
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,329
But now is not the time.

31
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,124
You once said
this isn't a democracy.

32
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,626
Now you have to
own up to that.

33
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,963
I put my family's life
in your hands.

34
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,299
So get your head clear

35
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,010
and do something.

36
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,471
( creaks )

37
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,232
( walkers snarling )

38
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,902
( door opens )

39
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,201
You shouldn't be
out here.

40
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,704
I'm a good shot.

41
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,873
Yes, you are.

42
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,879
Hey, Dad?

43
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,714
Yeah?

44
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,844
If I say something,
will you promise not to be mad?

45
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,930
I won't get mad.

46
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,768
You should stop.

47
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,687
Stop what?

48
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,773
Being the leader.

49
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,739
Let Hershel and Daryl
handle things.

50
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,118
You deserve a rest.

51
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,349
( theme music playing )

52
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,305
Governor:
How many does that give us now?

53
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:28,559
20. We have several people
with chronic conditions,

54
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,437
hearing impairments,
arthritis.

55
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:36,150
Adding those
gives us 26.

56
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,530
And if we include men
and women age 13 and up?

57
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,616
You mean boys and girls?

58
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:48,704
Adolescence--
it's a 20th century invention.

59
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,831
Men and women.

60
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,837
Uh, 35.

61
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,424
Well, make sure they all have
sidearms and plenty of ammo.

62
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,843
We'll start training
when Martinez is ready.

63
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,809
Well, come in.

64
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,979
What's this I hear
about the prison?

65
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,981
You said you were
gonna leave it alone.

66
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,440
No retaliation.

67
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,234
I went to negotiate.

68
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,236
Bad enough we got
biters at our gates.

69
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,613
We can't have aggressors
just miles away.

70
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,407
So you went and welcomed
them to the neighborhood?

71
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,325
You know they shot at us?

72
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,703
I don't know who these people
were when you were with them,

73
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,914
but they've changed.
They're bloodthirsty.

74
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,251
You knew about this?

75
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,254
I was informed
this morning.

76
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,797
I didn't know.

77
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,549
Don't drag him into it.

78
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,635
You're right.
This is between you and me.

79
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,638
I'm sick of this.
Sick of the lies.

80
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,223
And I'm not gonna watch
this town

81
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,933
and my friends
gun each other down.

82
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,601
Well, it's too late.

83
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,353
What do you mean
it's too late?

84
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,813
I don't know what
you're trying to prove,

85
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,356
but enough is enough.

86
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,275
I'm going to see them.

87
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,735
I'll work this out.

88
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,862
Well, they're hostile.

89
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,240
These are all the able-bodied
people we have.

90
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,325
They're gonna carry arms
and receive training.

91
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,286
We won't get caught
sleeping again.

92
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,080
One car,
that is all I need.

93
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,667
The roads are blocked.

94
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,253
We barely made it
back ourselves.

95
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,469
Andrea.

96
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,346
You go to that prison,

97
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,724
you stay there.

98
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,750
Karen:
Noah's only 14.

99
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,044
Okay? He has asthma.
He can't run more than 10 yards

100
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,338
before losing his breath.
What good is that to you?

101
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,632
Martinez: The Governor wants
everyone who can hold a gun

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,802
- in front of the town hall now.
- No.

103
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,179
Andrea, you have to
straighten this out.

104
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,722
They want Noah to fight.

105
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,225
Who's talking
about fighting?

106
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,019
You're supposed to be teaching
people to defend themselves,

107
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,938
not raising an army.

108
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,482
Wake up.

109
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,944
The only way to defend
ourselves is with an army.

110
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,657
Take watch.
Eyes open, head down.

111
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,786
Field's filled with walkers.

112
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,496
Didn't see any
snipers out there,

113
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,540
but we'll keep
Maggie on watch.

114
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,792
I'll get up
in the guard tower,

115
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,628
take out half them walkers, give these
guys a chance to fix the fence.

116
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,047
Or use some of the cars
to put the bus in place.

117
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,551
We can't access the field
without burning through our bullets.

118
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,804
So we're trapped in here.
There's barely any food or ammo.

119
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,889
Been here before.
We'll be all right.

120
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,308
That's when it was
just us.

121
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,352
Before there was
a snake in the nest.

122
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,146
Man, we gonna go
through this again?

123
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,107
Look, Merle's staying here.
He's with us now.

124
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,234
- Get used to it.
- Hey.

125
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,403
All y'all.

126
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,951
Seriously, Rick, I don't think Merle
living here is really gonna fly.

127
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,911
I can't kick him out.

128
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,539
I wouldn't ask you to live with Shane
after he tried to kill you.

129
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,458
Merle has
military experience.

130
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,544
He may be erratic,

131
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,380
but don't underestimate
his loyalty to his brother.

132
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,507
What if we solve both
problems at once?

133
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,093
Deliver Merle to the Governor.
Bargaining chip.

134
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,346
Give him his traitor,
maybe declare a truce.

135
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,111
You're the farmer Hershel.

136
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,948
And you're
the black sheep Merle.

137
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,912
How'd you lose it?

138
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,914
I was bit.

139
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,334
Bit?
You hack it off yourself?

140
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,336
No.

141
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,423
Rick did.

142
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,134
Awful kindly of him.

143
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,303
Saved my life.

144
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,890
Gave me more time
with my girls.

145
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,476
Gave you more time
with your brother.

146
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:23,812
Can't put a price on that.

147
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,233
Can't put a price
on anything anymore.

148
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,116
I found this

149
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,786
in one of the cells.

150
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,624
Lost more than the Good Book
there for a while.

151
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,918
Lost my way.

152
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,177
"And if your right hand
offends you,

153
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,555
cut it off,
cast it from you.

154
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,392
For it is profitable

155
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,644
that one of your members
should perish--"

156
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,690
"And not that thy whole body
should be cast into hell."

157
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,361
Matthew 5:29 and 30.

158
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,496
Woodbury had
a damn fine library.

159
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,333
One of the only things
I miss about it.

160
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,756
When the Governor returns,

161
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,342
he's gonna kill me first.

162
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,138
Michonne, my brother,

163
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,807
then your girls.

164
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,684
Glenn, Carl, the baby,

165
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,602
whoever else is left.

166
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,688
He'll save Rick for last

167
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:51,233
so he can watch his family
and friends die ugly.

168
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,653
That's who
you're dealing with.

169
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,118
This is Mrs. McLeod.

170
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,579
She's the one
with arthritis.

171
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,419
Well, thank you, dear,

172
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,213
but we'll find another way
you can help us.

173
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,185
Noah's asthmatic.

174
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,524
You ever shoot
a gun, son?

175
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,736
I had a BB gun once.
My mom took it away.

176
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,614
Well, you're gonna learn
from the best.

177
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,254
Haven't had a chance to say
I'm glad you came back.

178
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,759
To what?
All this?

179
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,805
This is our home.

180
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,935
This is a tomb.

181
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,606
That's what T-Dog
called it.

182
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,442
Thought he was right

183
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,820
till you found me.

184
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,625
He's your brother,
but he's not good for you.

185
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,836
Don't let him
bring you down.

186
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,132
After all,
look how far you've come.

187
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,806
( both laugh )

188
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,990
We sealed it thoroughly.

189
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,826
Nobody's getting in or out.

190
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,914
I'm gonna ask
you something

191
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,083
and I need you
to be honest.

192
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,335
Okay.

193
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,504
The fight at the prison,

194
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,506
you swear you didn't know
anything about it?

195
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,800
I wouldn't advocate
a move like that.

196
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,844
It's just posturing.

197
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,306
Good. Then you have to
cover for me.

198
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,850
I'm going to the prison.

199
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,561
- And the Governor can't know.
- Don't.

200
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,855
I have to.
I was with them.

201
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,857
Don't put me
in this situation.

202
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,984
- I wish there was another way.
- If he finds out--

203
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,360
That's a chance
we have to take.

204
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,528
Maybe you do,
but I don't.

205
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,489
I'm sorry. I can't.

206
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,657
Look at
what's happened.

207
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,244
Woodbury is an armed camp
with child soldiers.

208
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,039
Cannon fodder in a war
over what?

209
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,832
Is that what
all your work is for?

210
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,001
Please, help me
get out of here.

211
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,046
I can't take a car.
They won't open the gates.

212
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,841
I just need to sneak out,
make my way to the prison,

213
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,010
- and talk to Rick.
- This is a betrayal.

214
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,723
No, it's an attempt to stop this
before more people get killed.

215
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,059
You can do this, Milton.

216
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,068
( groans )

217
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,906
( strikes match )

218
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,038
( faint gasp )

219
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,425
( knocks )

220
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,470
- Come in.
- ( door opens )

221
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,643
You asked me
to keep tabs on her.

222
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,982
That's right.

223
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,069
She's going back
to the prison

224
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,989
and has requested
my assistance in escaping.

225
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,241
Her words, not mine.

226
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,079
Help her.

227
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,749
Okay, do you really
want me to do that,

228
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,334
or is this
some sort of test?

229
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,045
( chuckles )

230
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,549
If she asks for help,

231
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,968
help her.

232
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,597
Milton.

233
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,974
Good work.

234
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,942
( snarling )

235
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,176
Hey, you!

236
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,386
( snarling )

237
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,348
Oh, shit. Andrea!

238
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,894
Pin it down.

239
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,146
Don't let it up.

240
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,202
Just a little more.

241
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,722
( grunts )

242
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,691
Lift its head.

243
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,027
Force it down.

244
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,072
- Hey, hold it! Hold it!
- Milton: I'm trying.

245
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,754
- ( snarling )
- Watch out.

246
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,931
All right.

247
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,060
Can we finish
this up, please?

248
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,979
I got it.
I got it.

249
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,623
( snarling )

250
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,144
Smart to stay fit.

251
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,024
Don't leave out
the cardio.

252
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,653
You know, if we're gonna
live under the same roof,

253
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,323
we should clear the air.

254
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,700
This whole hunting
you down thing,

255
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,329
that was just business.

256
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,997
Carrying out orders.

257
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,958
Hmm.
Like the Gestapo.

258
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,503
Yeah. Exactly.

259
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,132
I've done a lot of things
I ain't proud of.

260
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,802
Before and after.

261
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,308
Anyway, hope we
can get past it.

262
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,854
Let bygones
be bygones.

263
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,197
It's a diversionary tactic.

264
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,241
It keeps
the walkers away.

265
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,536
Didn't work so well
with those two.

266
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,040
You got a camp?

267
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,003
It's just us.

268
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,551
We have a town.
It's walled.

269
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,761
Milton:
There's about 70 of us.

270
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,515
You take people in?

271
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,226
We do.

272
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,854
- I'll take them back.
- Are you sure?

273
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,943
- If he asks, just--
- I'll handle it.

274
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,863
I'm better with him
than I am with them.

275
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,241
Thank you so much.

276
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,201
We've had a rough
couple of days.

277
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,871
- Where you going?
- Got to finish my run.

278
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,206
- By yourself?
- I'll be fine.

279
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,417
Got my guardian
angel here.

280
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,878
- Need any help?
- Nope.

281
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,255
I'm good.

282
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,347
( snarling )

283
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,461
Carl:
Psst.

284
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,463
Something weird
out there.

285
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,812
( whispers )
Andrea.

286
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,190
Get your dad
and the others.

287
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,528
Go.

288
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,864
Clear!

289
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,036
- Are you alone?
- Open the gate.

290
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,705
Are you alone?!

291
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,665
Rick!

292
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,341
Open it.

293
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,428
Hands up!
Turn around.

294
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,888
- What?
- Turn around now!

295
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,272
- ( snarling )
- ( screams )

296
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,025
Get down
on the floor.

297
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,031
I asked
if you were alone.

298
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,575
I am.

299
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,764
Welcome back.

300
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,475
Get up.

301
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,295
After you saved me,
we thought you were dead.

302
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,300
Hershel, my God.

303
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,140
I can't believe this.

304
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,520
Where's Shane?

305
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,654
And Lori?

306
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,952
Hershel: She had a girl.
Lori didn't survive.

307
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,496
Neither did T-Dog.

308
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,165
I'm so sorry.

309
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,294
Carl.

310
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,179
Rick, I--

311
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,729
You all live here?

312
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,483
Here and the cell block.

313
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,569
There?

314
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,696
Well, can I go in?

315
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:53,575
- I won't allow that.
- I'm not an enemy, Rick.

316
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,827
We had that field
and courtyard

317
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,204
until your boyfriend
tore down the fence

318
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,039
with a truck
and shot us up.

319
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,710
He said you fired first.

320
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,670
Well, he's lying.

321
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,883
He killed an inmate
who survived in here.

322
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,886
We liked him.
He was one of us.

323
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,722
I didn't know
anything about that.

324
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,183
As soon as I found out,
I came.

325
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,520
I didn't even know you were in
Woodbury until after the shoot-out.

326
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,897
That was days ago.

327
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,025
I told you, I came
as soon as I could.

328
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,407
- What have you told them?
- Nothing.

329
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,868
I don't get it.
I left Atlanta with you people

330
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,411
and now
I'm the odd man out?

331
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,581
He almost killed Michonne
and he would have killed us.

332
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,124
With his finger
on the trigger.

333
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,918
Isn't he the one
who kidnapped you?

334
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,462
Who beat you?

335
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,758
Look,

336
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:55,553
I cannot excuse or explain
what Philip has done.

337
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,556
But I am here trying
to bring us together.

338
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,433
We have to work this out.

339
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,935
There's nothing
to work out.

340
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,811
We're gonna kill him.

341
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,606
I don't know how
or when, but we will.

342
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:10,318
We can settle this.

343
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,738
There is room at Woodbury
for all of you.

344
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,116
( Merle chuckles )
You know better than that.

345
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,663
What makes you think
this man wants to negotiate?

346
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,873
Hershel:
Did he say that?

347
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,625
No.

348
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,336
Rick: Then why did you
come here?

349
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,297
Because he's
gearing up for war.

350
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,716
The people are terrified.
They see you as killers.

351
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,969
They're training to attack.

352
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,805
I'll tell you what.
Next time you see Philip,

353
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,140
you tell him I'm gonna
take his other eye.

354
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,476
We're taken too much shit
for too long.

355
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,395
He wants a war?
He's got one.

356
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,649
Rick.

357
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,902
If you don't sit down
and try to work this out,

358
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,321
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

359
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,074
He has a whole town.

360
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,703
Look at you.

361
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,414
You've lost
so much already.

362
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,709
You can't stand
alone anymore.

363
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,585
You want to make
this right, get us inside.

364
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,087
- No.
- Then we got nothing to talk about.

365
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,880
There are innocent people.

366
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,802
( door opens,
bangs shut )

367
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,520
You poisoned them.

368
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,690
I just told them the truth.

369
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,859
I didn't choose him
over you.

370
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,527
I wanted a life.

371
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,530
Once we entered Woodbury,
you became hostile.

372
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,949
- That's 'cause I could see it.
- See what?

373
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,745
That you were under his spell
from the second you laid eyes on him.

374
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,289
- That is not true.
- And you still are.

375
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,958
No, I am there
because those people need me.

376
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,543
And what about
these people?

377
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,462
I'm trying to save
them, too.

378
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,714
( laughs )

379
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:58,509
I did not realize the messiah complex
was contagious.

380
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,511
Go to hell, Michonne.

381
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,682
He sent Merle
to kill me.

382
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,896
Would have sent him to kill you, too,
if you had come with me.

383
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,733
But you didn't, did you?

384
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,443
Hm-mmm.

385
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,363
You chose a warm bed
over a friend.

386
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,743
That's why I went back
to Woodbury.

387
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:27,580
Exposed him
for what he is.

388
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,043
I knew that it
would hurt you.

389
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,772
( sighs )

390
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,283
Dr. Stevens will be here soon.
We'll get you checked over.

391
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,661
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

392
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,413
Now you're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

393
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,165
We got food,
fresh clothing, hot water.

394
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,293
Normally we'd provide you with
weapons and a car for your journey,

395
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,671
but we need all we have.

396
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,006
Looks like you're battening down
the hatches. Were you guys attacked?

397
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,343
Yeah, but not by biters.
Some dangerous people out there.

398
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,139
They came at us
a few days ago.

399
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,307
Anyone hurt?

400
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,603
There were several fatalities.

401
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:37,191
- Ben: Damn. Sorry.
- Yeah.

402
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,027
Can't be too careful
these days.

403
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,947
When you're ready
to travel, head west.

404
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,991
Avoid anything north up 85.

405
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,368
We just came from there.

406
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,996
Ran into some
whack-job in a prison.

407
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,672
You saw him?

408
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,507
Oh, yeah.
Screaming like an idiot.

409
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,551
He's a little unhinged.

410
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,012
But the others
seemed decent.

411
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,890
Everything seemed cool
until their leader came back

412
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,808
and practically shoved
a gun in my face.

413
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,519
You were at the prison?

414
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:17,356
We went in for shelter.
Lost Allen's wife.

415
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,526
This guy Rick showed up
all of sudden, chased us out.

416
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:24,405
You need help
with these guys? We're in.

417
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,741
Well, now, no...

418
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,827
we couldn't ask you
to join in our fight.

419
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,537
Look, we don't want
to be out there.

420
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,164
It's only a matter
of time before--

421
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,833
No, I understand.

422
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,753
Whatever we got to do
to earn our keep.

423
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,840
Were you inside
the prison?

424
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,717
Can you describe
the layout?

425
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,720
It's pretty confusing,
but I could try.

426
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,890
You get your rest.

427
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,434
We can talk
about it tomorrow.

428
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,062
As I say, you're welcome to
stay here as long as you like.

429
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,565
But you take the night.
Talk it over.

430
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,567
Good night.

431
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,199
You can't leave without
meeting Little Ass-Kicker.

432
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,034
May I hold her?

433
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,245
- Of course.
- Oh.

434
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,288
Got her?

435
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,873
I got her.

436
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,876
- ( baby fusses )
- Oh, look at you.

437
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,754
Let me guess.

438
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,714
Daryl named her
"Ass-Kicker."

439
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,966
( laughs )

440
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,551
That's not
really her name.

441
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,220
- Judith.
- Judith.

442
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,472
Hi, Judith.

443
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,934
Oh, how precious
are you?

444
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,732
What happened to Lori?

445
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,610
During a C-section.

446
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,737
Maggie.

447
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,240
- Carl had to--
- Oh, my God.

448
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,160
T-Dog died leading me
to safety.

449
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,831
And Shane?

450
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,792
Rick killed him.

451
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,921
The night we left
the farm.

452
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,757
That whole Randall
thing was a lie.

453
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,093
Shane tried to kill Rick.

454
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,806
Shane loved Rick.

455
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,474
Shane loved Lori.

456
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,023
Rick's become cold.

457
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,150
Unsteady.

458
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,820
He has his reasons.

459
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,993
The Governor,
you need to do something.

460
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,203
I am.

461
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,957
No, you need
to sleep with him.

462
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,668
Give him the greatest
night of his life.

463
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,503
You get him
to drop his guard.

464
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,633
Then when he's sleeping,
you can end this.

465
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,326
Thanks.

466
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,704
Can you spare it?

467
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,915
Yeah.

468
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,851
Well, take care.

469
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,569
Andrea.

470
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,246
Be careful.

471
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,083
You, too.

472
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,920
( engine starts )

473
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,490
Go!

474
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,912
( snarling )

475
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,256
( gate screeches )

476
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,343
( Merle yells )

477
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,855
Heads up!

478
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,483
Hey, get down.

479
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,829
That's far enough.

480
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,631
Hands up.

481
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,896
( music playing )

482
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,368
I went to the prison.

483
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,203
They're broken,

484
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,206
living in horrible
conditions.

485
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,875
Michonne there?

486
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,212
Merle?

487
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,548
Yes.

488
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,175
And Rick?

489
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,349
Yes.

490
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,769
He send you back here?

491
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,064
No.

492
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:35,192
That was my call.

493
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,740
Why?

494
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,306

We all are.

516
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,737
Andrea's persuasive.

517
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,032
This fella's armed
to the teeth.

518
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,367
Bent on destruction.

519
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,120
So what do you
want to do?

520
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,747
We match it.

521
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,623
I'm going on a run.

522
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,250
I'll head out tomorrow.

523
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,044
No, you stay here.

524
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,047
Keep an eye
on your brother.

525
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,383
I'm glad you're back, really,

I got him.

00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,936
- I'll take Michonne.
- Daryl: You sure that's a good idea?

529
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,105
I'll find out.

530
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,400
And Carl.

531
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,570
He's ready.

532
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,947
