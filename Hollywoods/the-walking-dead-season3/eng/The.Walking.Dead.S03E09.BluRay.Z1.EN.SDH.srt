1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,797
Crowd:
Kill 'em! Kill 'em!

2
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,705
Crowd:
Kill 'em! Kill 'em!

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,251
- Let me go. Let me go.
- You can't go.

4
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:46,587
Let him go. Philip.

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,882
- Stay out of this.
- He's my friend.

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,260
It's not up
to me anymore.

7
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,096
- The people have spoken.
- What?

8
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,099
I asked you where
your loyalties lie.

9
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,726
You said here.

10
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,686
Well, prove it.

11
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,105
Prove it to us all.

12
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,525
- Brother against brother.
- Crowd: Yeah.

13
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,527
Winner goes free.

14
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,821
( crowd cheering )

15
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,074
Fight to the death.

16
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,744
( cheering )

17
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,790
Philip, please.
Don't do this.

18
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,792
Don't do this.

19
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,757
- Man: Let's go, Merle!
- Man #2: Come on, Merle!

20
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,926
- Woman: Yeah, Merle!
- Yeah!

21
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,472
- Y'all know me.
- ( crowd cheering )

22
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,892
I'm gonna do
whatever I got to do

23
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,643
to prove...

24
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,645
- ( grunts )
- ( cheering )

25
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,231
( coughing )

26
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,319
that my loyalty
is to this town!

27
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,740
( blows landing )

28
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,160
( snarling )

29
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,670
Ah!

30
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,351
You really think this
asshole's gonna let you go?

31
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,103
Just follow my lead,
little brother.

32
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,690
We're getting out
of this right now.

33
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,288
( grunts )

34
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,043
Philip, no.
Stop this.

35
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,711
Philip, stop this!

36
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,097
( crowd gasps )

37
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,061
- ( gunshot )
- ( people screaming )

38
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,903
( gunfire )

39
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,921
Come on, little brother.

40
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,924
( yelling )

41
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,011
Stay close!

42
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,179
Daryl!

43
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,441
Merle, come on.

44
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,276
Go!

45
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:59,947
( gunshot )

46
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,533
- ( screams )
- ( gunshot )

47
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,620
( sighs )

48
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,842
Let's go.

49
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,309
- Rick: Daryl.
- Let's go. Go.

50
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,988
( theme music playing )

51
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,776
- ( gunfire )
- ( people shouting )

52
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,032
They're all at the arena.
This way.

53
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,034
You're not going
anywhere with us.

54
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,620
You really want
to do this now?

55
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,539
- ( clanging )
- ( Merle grunting )

56
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,207
Come on, man.

57
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,418
( panel opens )

58
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,712
Rick, come on.
We've got to go.

59
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,547
- Go.
- ( thudding )

60
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,883
( Merle grunting )

61
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,885
A little help would be nice.

62
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,388
( snarling )

63
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,896
We ain't got time for this.

64
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,732
Let's go.

65
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,969
Rick: Glenn!

66
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,597
Rick. Rick.

67
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,682
Rick.

68
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,642
Oh, thank God.

69
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,603
Now we got a problem here.
I need you to back up.

70
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,521
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Hey, hey, hey!

71
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,607
- Hey, put it down!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

72
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,358
- Put it down!
- He tried to kill me!

73
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,944
- If it wasn't for him--
- He helped us get out of there.

74
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,946
Yeah, right after he beat
the shit out of you.

75
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,616
- Hey, we both took our licks, man.
- Jackass.

76
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,493
- Hey, shut up.
- Enough!

77
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,662
- Hey, hey, relax!
- Put that down now!

78
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,289
Get that thing
out of my face!

79
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,334
( laughs ) Man, look like you've
gone native, brother.

80
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,669
No more than you hanging out
with that psycho back there.

81
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,131
Oh, yeah, man. He is a charmer,
I got to tell you that.

82
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,051
Been putting the wood
to your girlfriend Andrea.

83
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,720
- Big time, baby. ( moans )
- Glenn: What?

84
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,806
Andrea's in Woodbury?

85
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,808
Right next to the Governor.

86
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,477
I told you to drop that!

87
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,312
You know Andrea?

88
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,525
Hey, do you know Andrea?

89
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,152
Merle:
Yep, she does.

90
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,238
Her and blondie
spent all winter

91
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,490
cuddling up in the forest.

92
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,284
Mm-mmm-mmm.
Yeah.

93
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,496
My Nubian queen here
had two pet walkers.

94
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,332
No arms,
cut off the jaws,

95
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,334
kept them in chains.

96
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,128
Kind of ironic now
that I think about it.

97
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,671
Shut up, bro.

98
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,881
Hey, man, we snagged them
out of the woods.

99
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,717
Andrea was close to dying.

100
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,636
- Is that why she's with him?
- Merle: Yeah.

101
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,888
Snug as two little bugs.

102
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,683
So what you gonna
do now, Sheriff, huh?

103
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,393
Surrounded by a bunch
of liars, thugs, and cowards.

104
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,019
Shut up!

105
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,356
Oh, man, look at this.
Pathetic.

106
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,191
All these guns
and no bullets in them.

107
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,693
Merle, shut up!

108
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,695
Shut up yourself!
Bunch of pussies you roll--

109
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,246
Asshole.

110
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,418
( door clangs )

111
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,049
You can take those stiches out
yourself in a week or so.

112
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,593
Thank you.

113
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,180
Pretty nice having
medical training.

114
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,724
It'll only get you so far.

115
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,060
You were bit?

116
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,939
( door opens )

117
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,699
How old is the baby?

118
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,076
Barely a week.

119
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,584
To be honest, we never thought
we'd see another baby.

120
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,839
Beautiful.

121
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,258
Thanks.

122
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,427
How are you feeling?

123
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,182
She's not mine.

124
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,434
Where's the mother?

125
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,106
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,902
Man, you people have
been through the mill.

127
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,156
Haven't we all?

128
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,993
It's only getting
worse out there.

129
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,788
Dead are everywhere.

130
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,415
And it's only making
the living

131
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,252
less like the living.

132
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,129
You're the only decent folks
we've come across.

133
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,674
You've been out there
all this time?

134
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,803
Our neighbor Jerry, he was one
of those survivalist nuts.

135
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,429
Everybody on the block
thought he was crazy.

136
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,139
Always preparing
for the end of the world.

137
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,308
- Who knew?
- Jerry knew.

138
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,478
He had a bunker under
his shed in the backyard.

139
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,148
Sasha and I stayed there
until we ran out of supplies.

140
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,485
Allen and Ben were the first
two people we ran into

141
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,445
when we finally crawled
up out of that hole

142
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,447
around Jacksonville.

143
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,074
Used to be a bunch of us.

144
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,702
25 at one point.

145
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,456
Our camp was overrun
six, seven weeks ago.

146
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,003
Tyreese:
And-- and Donna,

147
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,171
she, uh...

148
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,387
We'll see that she has
a proper burial.

149
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,806
I appreciate you
taking care of us.

150
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,726
For a while, we didn't know
who we were dealing with.

151
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,687
Neither did we.

152
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,814
We've had our problems
with people.

153
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,858
I must be the first
brother in history

154
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,860
- to break into prison.
- ( Hershel chuckles )

155
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,904
Makes me the first white boy
that didn't want to break out.

156
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,699
( chuckles )

157
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,249
Tyreese.

158
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:11,837
Like I said, we have
a much larger group.

159
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,756
A close-knit group.

160
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,469
I wouldn't get
too comfortable here.

161
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,057
We wouldn't be a problem.

162
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,143
It's not up to me.

163
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,312
Then who?

164
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,067
Please, you can see
what kind of people we are.

165
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,573
( lock clicks )

166
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,413
Rick:
It won't work.

167
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,874
- Daryl: It's gotta.
- It'll stir things up.

168
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,418
Look, the Governor is probably on
the way to the prison right now.

169
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,587
Merle knows how he thinks
and we could use the muscle.

170
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,422
- I'm not having him at the prison.
- He had a gun to our heads.

171
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,800
Do you really want him sleeping in
the same cell block as Carol or Beth?

172
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,468
- He ain't a rapist.
- Well, his buddy is.

173
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,387
They ain't buddies no more.
Not after last night.

174
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,055
There's no way
Merle's gonna live there

175
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,099
without putting everyone
at each other's throats.

176
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,017
So you're gonna cut Merle loose and
bring the last samurai home with us?

177
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,519
She's not coming back.

178
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,771
She's not in a state
to be on her own.

179
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,774
- She did bring you guys to us.
- And then ditched us.

180
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,610
- At least let my dad stitch her up.
- She's too unpredictable.

181
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,321
That's right.
We don't know who she is.

182
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,407
But Merle, Merle's blood.

183
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,575
No, Merle is your blood.

184
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,953
My blood, my family
is standing right here

185
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,788
and waiting for us
back at the prison.

186
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,208
And you're part
of that family.

187
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,628
But he's not.
He's not.

188
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,715
Man, y'all don't know.

189
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,805
Fine.
We'll fend for ourselves.

190
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,640
That's not what
I was saying.

191
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,475
No him, no me.

192
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,145
Daryl, you don't
have to do that.

193
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,480
It was always Merle
and I before this.

194
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,732
- Maggie: Don't.
- Glenn: You serious?

195
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,610
- You're just gonna leave like that?
- You'd do the same thing.

196
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,779
What do you want us
to tell Carol?

197
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,115
She'll understand.

198
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,914
Say good-bye
to your pop for me.

199
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,208
Daryl, are you serious?
Daryl!

200
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,462
Hey. Hey.

201
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,672
There's got to be
another way.

202
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,968
Don't ask me
to leave him.

203
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,137
I already did that once.

204
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,102
We started something
last night.

205
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,897
You realize that, huh?

206
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,066
No him, no me.
That's all I can say.

207
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,032
Take care of yourself.

208
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,202
Take care of Lil Ass-Kicker.

209
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,037
Carl.

210
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,500
He's one tough kid.

211
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,133
Daryl!

212
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,719
Come on, bro.

213
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,570
We patch you up
and then you are gone.

214
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,259
Where'd they say
we could bury her?

215
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,636
Back of the field
near the other graves.

216
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,973
Hey.
Wait a minute.

217
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,474
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

218
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,268
Losing my grip here.

219
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,937
Come on, put her down.

220
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,402
Okay.

221
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,460
Golden opportunity.

222
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,337
For what?

223
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,215
Little kid and a woman.

224
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,219
Ask them for a hand,
get a hold of those weapons.

225
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,429
What?

226
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,806
We do it quick, they'll never
know what hit them.

227
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,976
- No. Whoa, whoa.
- We're out here to bury Donna.

228
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,312
And we will, after.

229
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,606
- Shut up.
- Look at this place.

230
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,441
It's secure.

231
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,860
- These are good people.
- This will be easy.

232
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,821
A little kid, a woman, a girl
and a one-legged old man.

233
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,532
Don't forget about
the convict.

234
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,743
You gonna smash
the baby's head with a rock?

235
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,162
- What is your problem?
- How about a little common decency?

236
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,497
This isn't what we do.

237
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,584
Allen:
You're living in the past, Ty.

238
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,628
So are you.
This is survival

239
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,338
of the fittest,
plain and simple.

240
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,132
- In here we live, out there we die.
- ( gate opens )

241
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,675
And I am not waiting around

242
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,052
for the rest of their group
to roll in here

243
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,137
- and throw us out on our asses.
- Not a chance.

244
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,556
How do you know
that's gonna happen?

245
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,768
Got some tools for you.

246
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,233
It's much appreciated.

247
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,486
Yeah, we'll take it
from here.

248
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,156
You don't need no help
with the body?

249
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,533
No, we'll manage.

250
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,078
Let us know if you
need anything else.

251
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,205
Thank you.

252
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,384
( gate shuts )

253
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,575
Get the brakes.

254
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:20,997
( snarling )

255
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,582
I got it.

256
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,751
( grunting )

257
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,612
You didn't kill him.

258
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,118
That's not why
we went back.

259
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,955
No. That's right.
You went back for Daryl.

260
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,459
And now he's gone again
and the Governor is still alive.

261
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,878
- Daryl was the priority.
- I should have been there with you.

262
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,881
- You were in no condition.
- But my girlfriend was?

263
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,468
- Glenn, this isn't about us.
- I should have been there.

264
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,137
Hey, hey, you didn't come back with
us 'cause you could barely walk.

265
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,139
- What about her?
- What about me?

266
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,141
- Do you know what he did to her?!
- Leave it alone!

267
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,935
- Do you know?
- Let's go.

268
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,240
After all that effort,
all the risk we took,

269
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,826
Daryl just takes off
with Merle?

270
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,996
Well, he had his reasons.

271
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,957
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that, Rick.

272
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,668
Doesn't change the fact that
we're up to our necks in shit.

273
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,797
You want me to turn the car around,
beg him to come back?

274
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,673
Throw down a welcome mat
for Merle?

275
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,051
This is the hand
we've been dealt!

276
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,054
Let's just get this out
of here and get back.

277
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,682
Get some rest.
We can talk it out there.

278
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,894
No, you guys do all
the talking you want. I'm done.

279
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,197
( crowd shouting )

280
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,074
How many injured?

281
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,034
Nine.

282
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,869
Stevens has it covered.

283
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,038
So where is he?

284
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,999
- In his apartment.
- And?

285
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,668
He wouldn't open the door.

286
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,461
Said he was in the middle
of something.

287
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,213
It's all going to hell.

288
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,757
( horn honking )

289
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,052
( clamoring )

290
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,221
- Open the gate!
- ( horn honking )

291
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,890
( all shouting )

292
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,603
Calm down, people.

293
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,814
- Back away.
- It's not safe here.

294
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,190
We want to leave.

295
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,276
- There's biters out here, lady.
- Let us out.

296
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,403
Get back!

297
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,573
- ( shouting continues )
- I told you to get back.

298
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,785
- Nobody leaves.
- Hey, Martinez, we got biters.

299
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,704
All right,
take them out.

300
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,957
( gunshots )

301
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,962
- Everybody calm down.
- We can't stay here anymore.

302
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,172
This place is crazy.
Please, you have to let us go.

303
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,258
Karen, you don't want to go out there.
It's too dangerous.

304
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,969
- Yeah, well, we'll take our chances.
- Karen: Please!

305
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,931
( horns honking )

306
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,766
- Hey!
- Hey, knock off the horn.

307
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,269
- Knock off that horn.
- Martinez!

308
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,771
- Get out of the car.
- Put the gun down.

309
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,441
- Get out of the car.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

310
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,151
Don't hurt him.
Don't hurt him.

311
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,153
Hey, I don't take
orders from you.

312
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,822
These people are scared.
Shoving a gun in their face won't help.

313
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,866
- Where's the Governor?
- He's--

314
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,744
- There's a riot out here.
- You're making things worse.

315
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,747
- I am?
- ( people screaming )

316
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,083
- Andrea: What the hell?
- Martinez: Move!

317
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,298
( snarling )

318
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,799
Get back, get back!

319
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,676
( groaning )

320
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,554
( gunshots )

321
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,806
( clicking )

322
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,111
( groaning )

323
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,493
Oh, my God.

324
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,328
Help him.

325
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,914
Somebody, please?

326
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,875
( groaning )

327
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,627
Help.

328
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,883
Karen:
Do something.

329
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,153
( door slams )

330
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,869
( birds chirping )

331
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,042
It's so quiet.

332
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,091
It's easy to forget how loud
the world used to be.

333
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,176
( laughs )

334
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,263
I used to complain
about it all the time.

335
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,724
Traffic, construction,

336
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,019
car alarms,
noise pollution.

337
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,146
Oh.

338
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,026
What I wouldn't give
for the sweet sound

339
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,194
of a jumbo jet.

340
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,533
It'd be even sweeter
if we were all on it.

341
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,418
Your mom
was proud of you.

342
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,258
For what?
Being mean to her?

343
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,012
No, you can't
think about that.

344
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,599
It's all I think about.

345
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,726
( car approaching )

346
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,644
Please be them.

347
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,567
It's them. Hurry.

348
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,455
- Drive 'em up. I'll meet you there.
- Maggie: Okay.

349
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,791
Thank God.

350
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,380
- Where's Hershel?
- He's in the cell block.

351
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,300
Carol:
Where's Daryl?

352
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,803
It's all right.
He's alive.

353
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,640
We ran into his brother.

354
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,310
They went off.

355
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,357
He left?

356
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,989
Daryl left?

357
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,991
He's gone?

358
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,329
Is he coming back?

359
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,881
- Hey.
- Gone?

360
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,343
And Oscar?

361
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,180
No.

362
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,751
- ( door opens )
- ( footsteps approaching )

363
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,005
What the hell was that?

364
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,799
You put a round in a man's head
in front of all those people

365
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,885
and just take off?

366
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,470
- You have to talk to them.
- Why?

367
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,930
They're panicking.

368
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,932
They were ready to charge
through those gates.

369
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,851
So let 'em.

370
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,896
Those people
won't last a day.

371
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,772
Those people
have had it easy.

372
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,358
Barbecues and picnics.
That ends now.

373
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,777
Don't blame them for
the mess that you created.

374
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,446
They're scared.

375
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,573
Well, I'm through
holding their hands.

376
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:37,035
We're at war.
I should have seen that.

377
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,997
So why was Daryl here?

378
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,083
Was he part of the assault?

379
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,461
Why?
Why would he do that?

380
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,421
He came for his friends.

381
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,548
The other people you know.

382
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,634
Glenn and Maggie.

383
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,928
Merle scooped them up
on the run.

384
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,556
Was holding them to find out
where his brother was.

385
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,937
My-- my friends are still alive
and we're shooting at each other?

386
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,438
You're trying
to execute them?

387
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,649
Your friends killed
six good people.

388
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,943
Crowley, Tim, Gargulio,

389
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,237
Eisenberg, Bob Adams.

390
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,113
Haley.

391
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,076
That man out there,
Rich Foster, he makes seven.

392
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,620
So that's what
your friends did.

393
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,332
Why didn't you
tell me they were here?

394
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,085
You kept that from me
while we were...

395
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,174
You're just a visitor here.

396
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,468
Just passing through.

397
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,137
So why should I tell you?

398
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,019
Don't do that.

399
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,939
Don't drive me out.
Not now.

400
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,524
- ( knocks )
- What is it?

401
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,151
The whole town
is out on the street.

402
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,195
It could get ugly again.

403
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,128
Take your sister inside.

404
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,144
Go on.

405
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,526
You came through,
like always.

406
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,572
Sounds like we have
a new problem on our hands.

407
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,907
- Yeah.
- You get a good look at him?

408
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,039
He had Daryl and Merle
pitted against each other.

409
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:50,043
A crowd cheering for them
to fight to the death.

410
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,880
What kind of a sick mind
does that?

411
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,883
The kind this world creates.

412
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,221
What's wrong?
Is it the baby?

413
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,349
No, the baby,
she's healthy.

414
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,727
Eats like a horse,
sleeps like a rock.

415
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,229
So what is it?

416
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:24,786
( door opens, closes )

417
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,058
Not exactly
a chatterbox, is he?

418
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,976
Be patient.

419
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,271
When he's ready,
let me do the talking.

420
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,616
She kind of has
Lori's eyes.

421
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,828
Don't you think?

422
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,789
( crying )

423
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,595
( crying continues )

424
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,694
( clamoring )

425
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,826
Milton:
Everyone, if I could--

426
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,661
if I could have
your attention.

427
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:52,039
- Everyone.
- All right, everybody shut up!

428
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,167
Thank you.

429
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,502
The biters on the perimeter
have been dispatched.

430
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,547
- The fences have been repaired.
- For now.

431
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,924
- Where's the Governor?
- ( crowd murmuring )

432
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,844
His-- his condition is...

433
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,345
unsteady.

434
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,014
The wound he suffered--

435
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,683
- Our friends were killed, man.
- He shot Richard.

436
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,353
I mean, we've all suffered.
We want answers.

437
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,772
( all shouting )

438
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,901
You're right, Karen.
You're right.

439
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,196
Every one of us
has suffered.

440
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,532
We don't even have
funerals anymore because

441
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,202
the death never stops.

442
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,498
We're never gonna
be the same.

443
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,541
Ever.

444
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,213
So what do we do?

445
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,259
We dig deep and we find
the strength to carry on.

446
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,929
We work together
and we rebuild.

447
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,431
Not just the fences,

448
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,726
the gates,
the community,

449
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,270
but ourselves.

450
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,397
Our hearts, our minds.

451
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,025
And years from now,
when they write about this plague

452
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,735
in the history books,

453
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,570
they will write
about Woodbury.

454
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,531
- Yeah, they will.
- Woodbury.

455
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,700
- We persevered.
- ( all agreeing )

456
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,874
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

457
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,641
( Judith fussing )

458
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,727
You've got
a knack for that.

459
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,564
Just trying
to do my part.

460
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,733
Sophia used to wake
the neighbors.

461
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,778
3:00 a.m.
Like clockwork.

462
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:51,492
Ed stayed at a friend's most
nights till she calmed down.

463
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,623
I always wanted a child.

464
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,464
She wouldn't have made it
if Daryl hadn't been here.

465
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,467
He couldn't stand
to lose anyone else.

466
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,803
Sounds like him.

467
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,307
I don't see why
he had to leave.

468
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,475
Merle sounds like a jerk.

469
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,980
Men like Merle
get into your head.

470
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,359
Make you feel like
you deserve the abuse.

471
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,946
Even for Daryl?

472
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,285
I'm hardly the woman
I was a year ago,

473
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,162
but if Ed walked through
that door right now

474
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,997
breathing and told me
to go with him,

475
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,541
I'd like to think
I'd tell him to go to hell.

476
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:45,212
You would.

477
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,300
It doesn't matter.

478
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,680
We're weak without him.

479
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,350
We'll get through
this, too.

480
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,228
Tyreese and his friends
seem capable.

481
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,982
I'm pissed at him
for leaving.

482
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,526
Don't be.

483
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,655
Daryl has his code.

484
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,157
This world needs
men like that.

485
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,038
- ( Judith crying )
- ( chuckles )

486
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:22,583
Oh. Hello.

487
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,214
- There.
- She fits perfect.

488
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,715
Yeah.

489
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,884
Wait.
You cozy in there?

490
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,511
Yes.

491
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,437
You got worked over good.

492
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,732
Surprised no bones
were broken.

493
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,360
It's courtesy
of Daryl's brother.

494
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,255
You two all right?

495
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:18,055
Thanks for looking
out for her.

496
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,474
If anything...

497
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,897
I'll go check on her.
You need something else?

498
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,943
Okay.

499
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,910
Same thing goes for you.

500
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,831
If anything worse than this
had happened to you...

501
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,628
You're like
my own son, Glenn.

502
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,354
You got something
needs looking at?

503
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,108
Is Glenn all right?

504
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,614
Go see.

505
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,551
You two seem to be
holding something back.

506
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,515
You want to tell me
what happened?

507
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:53,984
I rest easy knowing
you can handle yourself.

508
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,572
You've got
your mother's spirit.

509
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,575
And her stubbornness.

510
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:09,250
You hungry?

511
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,586
No.

512
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,425
Hey.

513
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,056
Don't disappear on me.

514
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,127
She's out like a light.

515
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,255
Must be days
since she slept.

516
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,594
You look pretty shot yourself.

517
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,596
How long before
she can travel?

518
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,097
Have to keep
an eye on her.

519
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,933
Pretty sure she has
a concussion.

520
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,769
Couple of days
if she's up.

521
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,407
Whenever Tomas went off,

522
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,744
Oscar always stood up
for me, you know?

523
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:30,623
He was my friend.

524
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,292
He went out fighting.

525
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,546
So what now?

526
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,965
You think the Governor
will retaliate?

527
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,301
- Maggie: Yes.
- Glenn: Let him try.

528
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,094
Sounds like he's got
a whole town.

529
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,138
We're outnumbered
and outgunned.

530
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,474
We could use
some reinforcements.

531
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,157
( door opens )

532
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:18,128
I'm Tyreese.

533
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,302
Sasha, Allen, Ben.

534
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,515
How'd you get in?

535
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:32,351
Fire damage to the administrative
part of the prison.

536
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,061
Wall's down.

537
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,522
That side's completely
overrun with walkers.

538
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,065
How'd you get this far?

539
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,485
We didn't.
We lost our friend Donna.

540
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,529
Carl:
They were lost in the tombs.

541
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,573
- You brought them here?
- Hershel: He had no choice.

542
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,080
I'm sorry
about your friend.

543
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,541
We know what that's like.

544
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,710
Hershel said you could
use some extra hands.

545
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,170
We're no stranger
to hard work.

546
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,215
We'll go out and get our own food,
stay out of your hair.

547
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,884
You got a problem with another group,
we'll help with that, too.

548
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,721
Anything to contribute.

549
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,185
No.

550
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,896
Sasha:
Please.

551
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,024
It's like "10 Little Indians"
out there.

552
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,568
It's just us now.

553
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,155
No.

554
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,240
Hershel:
Let's talk about this.

555
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,577
- We can't just keep--
- We've been through this.

556
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:35,247
With Tomas, Andrew.
Look what happened.

557
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:39,084
- Axel and Oscar weren't like them.
- And where's Oscar now?

558
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,928
I can't be responsible.

559
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,766
You turn us out,
you are responsible.

560
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,060
Hershel: Rick.

561
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,399
You've done
so much for us.

562
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,194
I appreciate that.
We all do.

563
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,446
We owe you our lives.

564
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,449
We've done
everything you asked

565
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,077
without question.

566
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:17,372
And I'm telling you
you're wrong on this.

567
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,043
You've got to start
giving people a chance.

568
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,736
( sighs )

569
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,988
Yeah.

570
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,297
No, no.

571
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,424
No, no, no, no.

572
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,680
No.

573
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:17,391
No, no, no,
no, no.

574
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,438
Why are you here?

575
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,066
- What do you want from me?
- Dad?

576
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,361
Why are you-- no.

577
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,287
I can't help you.
Get out!

578
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,747
- Tyreese: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Get-- get out!

579
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,000
Tyreese: Hey, come on.
Whoa, it's all good.

580
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,043
Sasha:
What are you doing?

581
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,879
Hey, easy, Rick.
There's no need to--

582
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,715
You don't belong here!
Get out! Please!

583
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,592
- Relax, brother. Relax.
- Get out! Get out!

584
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,635
Tyreese: We'll leave.
We're going.

585
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,470
Okay? Ain't nobody
got to get shot here.

586
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,556
- We're going.
- What are you doing here?!

587
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,726
- Okay, we're going.
- Just go! Go! Go!

588
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,477
Come on, come on.

589
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,167
