1
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,375
Bye, guys. See ya.

2
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,208
See ya, man.

3
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:32,541
ECLIPSO
LET THERE BE LIGHT!

4
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,333
Is anyone there?

5
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,791
Anyone there?

6
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,291
Help!

7
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,583
Is anyone there?

8
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,041
NETFLIX PRESENTS

9
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,875
Hey, Tonic Girl here.

10
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:44,250
For superhero tonicity,
the secret is a balanced diet.

11
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,083
You can trust Eat Salad.

12
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,750
You pick, you mix, you enjoy.

13
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,791
Energy for the whole day!

14
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,666
This morning's weather forecast
is brought to you by Tonic Girl.

15
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:32,083
Like every year, I'm proud to announce
the start of voting

16
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,250
to rank your favorite superheroes.

17
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,250
Tell us your pick in the comments below.

18
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,500
Who will be this year's winner?
Acteon maybe?

19
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,666
Will Furor beat out Optima?

20
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,208
I know who my money's on.

21
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,083
See you on the 25th for the results…

22
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,833
Nibbles, that's mine.

23
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,375
Don't forget to vote! Your--

24
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,333
Yes?

25
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,500
Sure, I'm on my way.

26
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,416
I'm in my car.

27
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,333
See you soon.

28
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,416
Lieutenant Moreau. What's the story?

29
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,708
Good morning.

30
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,250
Morning.

31
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:31,958
So?

32
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,000
Right.

33
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,333
Well, the story is arson, as you can see.

34
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,541
One floor is burned out.
Five wounded, three seriously.

35
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,541
The suspects, aged 18-19,
were refused entry to the club.

36
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,750
Unlikely they were packing flamethrowers,

37
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,041
so it's a case for you.

38
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,125
But I got started without you--

39
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,375
Good job. I had a shitshow to handle,
but I've got this now.

40
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,541
-Okay, but--
-Guys, usual procedure. Secure the scene.

41
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,916
Lock it down, the whole caboodle.

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,083
What can I say? Thank you and…

43
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,541
and goodbye.

44
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,208
Right.

45
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,833
Where the hell is Forensics?

46
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,291
In no hurry, obviously.

47
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,375
Been and gone already.

48
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,916
-Been and gone?
-Yeah.

49
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,916
Let's stay on top of everything.

50
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,458
Ten a.m., Moreau's here.

51
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,625
Ten a.m., Lorenzi's busting balls.

52
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,875
Did a super-granny hold up a minimart?

53
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,666
Come in.

54
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,583
What the hell took you so long?

55
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,875
I was with Lorenzi. He's in a bad way.

56
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,750
-Been hitting the bottle, I think.
-Right.

57
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Moreau.

58
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,583
Since you stopped working with Pack Royal,
your results have slipped.

59
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,375
I let you handle super-criminality, but…

60
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,666
let's be honest, you do jack shit.

61
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes. I mean no. I…

62
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,250
I went through a bad patch--

63
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,875
Lasting ten years?

64
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,458
I'm on it.

65
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,916
I work out, I jog--

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,791
Start jogging with Lt. Schaltzmann.

67
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,125
-Come in.
-Morning, Chief.

68
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,541
Sit, Lieutenant.

69
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,041
This is Moreau. You met earlier.

70
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,916
Moreau, this is Lt. Cécile Schaltzmann.
Spent four years in Financial Crimes.

71
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,291
Police academy valedictorian.

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,833
So?

73
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,083
So I'm sure you'll get along.

74
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,208
Schaltzmann's keen
to learn your street smarts--

75
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,208
Stop that now.

76
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,333
Stop it!

77
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,166
I tried being nice and understanding
and all that HR management bullshit,

78
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,458
but now it's over.

79
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,583
Got it?

80
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,541
This is not a suggestion. I'm telling you.

81
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,208
This is your new partner.

82
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,333
Thank you, Moreau.

83
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,916
Thank you!

84
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,416
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

85
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,125
"Keen to learn your street smarts"?

86
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,083
-Sure.
-No.

87
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,208
Don't speak for me. Thank you.

88
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,708
-Luxurious.
-Women are on the other side.

89
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,291
-There's a door with a dress on it.
-Hilarious.

90
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,750
We got a call to a high school.
A hostage situation.

91
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,500
Here and here.

92
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,666
Let's roll.

93
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,833
Ready in five.

94
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,916
Moreau?

95
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,458
Lieutenant, take a look.

96
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,500
All units, launch intervention.

97
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,541
What's he doing?

98
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,625
Back up!

99
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,958
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

100
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,125
I'm unarmed.

101
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,291
Whoa, no kidding.

102
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,333
Don't move!

103
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,166
Candy?

104
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,458
Back up!

105
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,041
Stop! Look at me.

106
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,125
Everyone, hold position.

107
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,875
Wait for orders.

108
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,125
Helps me think.

109
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,291
Keeps me calm.

110
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,416
It's too late.

111
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,041
It's too late for them.

112
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,875
Spent all year busting your balls,
they're gonna flunk.

113
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,791
You're a smart kid.

114
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,666
You have abilities.

115
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,250
Besides that.

116
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,333
You want to ruin everything?

117
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,375
No! Let me go! Stop!

118
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,708
You're hurting me!

119
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,875
The kid says the nightclub wasn't him,

120
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,375
but Forensics says the burns match, and…

121
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,416
he bought these two days ago,

122
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,708
to, and I quote,

123
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,250
"Light up those assholes
once and for all."

124
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,625
He just freaked out.

125
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,875
You have powers or you don't.

126
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,583
-I defer to the specialist.
-Yup.

127
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,041
Come on, let's go.

128
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,750
Hold on.

129
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,625
-Lily, sweetheart!
-Mom!

130
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:46,791
Are you okay?

131
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,375
Come on.

132
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,000
Go, drive.

133
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,125
Since you ask so nicely.

134
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,208
Out of candy?

135
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,291
So if he didn't torch the nightclub,
who did?

136
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,583
Two guys with the exact same power,
is that possible?

137
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,583
Yeah, if they're related.
But it's not automatic.

138
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,541
Really?

139
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,541
-Shit! There, that's perfect.
-Sorry?

140
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,250
Drop me at the roundabout.

141
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,458
The roundabout?

142
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,791
I can't park here. It's--

143
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,375
No sweat. I can get your ticket canceled.

144
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,250
Wait, I haven't stopped!

145
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,500
-What do I do?
-I don't know.

146
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,000
Improvise. Be creative.

147
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,750
Sure.

148
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,000
Go boil your ass!

149
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,625
Gigantic douchebag.

150
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,083
Hey.

151
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,125
Here. You never saw me.

152
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,625
Dispatch, do you copy?

153
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,666
Henri?

154
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,125
Careful, possible superhuman involvement.

155
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,708
Officer on site requesting backup.

156
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,083
Henri, where are you?

157
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,791
We're sending a patrol…

158
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,125
I'll bust you up.

159
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:37,125
Monte Carlo! Remember the name.
Monte Carlo…

160
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,375
Henri!

161
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,791
I didn't hear you come in.

162
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,250
What the hell?

163
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,250
I'm just testing a new model.

164
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,958
Needs a few tweaks.

165
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,791
-You good?
-Great.

166
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,875
Aren't you done listening to that?

167
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,833
I'm keeping up to speed.
You don't share anymore.

168
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,500
We don't work together anymore.

169
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,333
That reminds me, I hear there's new blood.

170
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,875
-Schaltzmann, right?
-Yup.

171
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,125
I took a peek at her file.

172
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,291
A real smart cookie.

173
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,916
A girl I'd love to work with
when I'm back in shape.

174
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,125
-She's cool?
-Yeah.

175
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,666
You see? My kind of liaison officer.

176
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,833
A liaison officer worth liaising with.

177
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,375
Watch and learn.

178
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,250
Did you get meatballs?

179
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,666
I got your meatballs.

180
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,250
That fish soup you bought had no relish.

181
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,375
Or croutons.

182
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,291
So I went without dinner.

183
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:20,208
RESIDENTS RESCUED BY PACK ROYAL

184
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:24,208
THREE TERRORISTS ARRESTED

185
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:29,375
FIVE YEARS OF EXPLOITS HAILED BY SJA

186
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,000
LE PACK ROYAL REUNITED

187
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,375
Freeze!

188
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,500
SUPERCOOK

189
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,333
So, Pierre, what have you concocted
for this challenge?

190
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,416
Today, Aurélie,
we're preparing surf 'n' turf.

191
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,000
Now, the really hard part
is getting the cooking times right.

192
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,625
You have a head start.

193
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,125
That is so phony.

194
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,250
Can you identify someone by their powers?

195
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,916
The great detective
needs his old friend Monte Carlo.

196
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,750
Can you or not?

197
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,541
Depends.

198
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,083
Who needs computers when you have this?

199
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,375
And my famous database.

200
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,875
What are the powers?

201
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,625
Flames. Throwing flames.

202
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,291
Hands firing flames six to seven meters.

203
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,791
Okay, fire powers, fireworks, arson…

204
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,708
Here we are.

205
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,708
Brasero.

206
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,958
Forty-two.

207
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,041
In an out of prison
for assault, corruption,

208
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,416
and last but not least, wife-beating.

209
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,375
Basically, a classy guy.

210
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,583
-Children?
-Negative.

211
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,500
Okay, there's enough food
for two or three days in the kitchen.

212
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,375
Four cheese was sold out. I got ham.

213
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,541
And ravioli.

214
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,208
Kind sir, you spoil me.

215
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,375
I'll see you out.

216
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,458
All good?

217
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:33,958
All good.

218
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,833
Just a little…

219
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,125
You taking your meds?

220
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,750
It's not about medication.

221
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,458
I'm just a bit tired.
Nothing to do with meds.

222
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,666
Take them. Keep the doctor happy.

223
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,166
I want to see Naja.

224
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,750
What's with you? Getting cocky?

225
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,250
It's important.

226
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,666
You demand to see me?

227
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,458
Are you…

228
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,916
Are you the boss?

229
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,958
I'm playing here.

230
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,583
Wanna try?

231
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,250
I have to talk to you.

232
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,458
Good or bad news?

233
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,500
Both.

234
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,583
Monday's headlines:

235
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,625
Another incident linked to a fire power

236
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,875
at a high school in northern Paris.

237
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,625
This comes only a few hours

238
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,291
after a nightclub was torched
a few streets away.

239
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,875
Gang turf battles,
organized crime, or isolated incidents?

240
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,375
That's the big question.

241
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,416
For now, the police have no explanation.

242
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,500
That's all we could salvage.

243
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,458
The substance is the same
found at the high school.

244
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,208
Forensics can't trace it.

245
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,791
The kid won't say who sold it to him.

246
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,750
No leads, and five casualties.

247
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,291
-Fire power reminds me of--
-Brasero.

248
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,250
Forty-two, jail time, petty crimes.

249
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,666
Domestic abuse.

250
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,541
When were you planning on sharing or…?

251
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,250
I'm sharing now.

252
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,583
-He have any children?
-No.

253
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,125
The teen has no links to him.

254
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,375
So Brasero is our number one suspect.

255
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,291
Find him, question him.

256
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,416
Where he lives, how he gets by,

257
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,916
who he sees on the weekends.

258
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,125
Get to work.

259
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,166
Pleased with yourself?

260
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,708
In general or on a specific issue?

261
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,916
Let me make something clear.

262
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,875
I'm not your driver or assistant.

263
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,791
I'm your partner, which means…

264
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,083
sharing intel.

265
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,375
-Can you grasp that concept?
-Sorry.

266
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,208
-Okay, sweetie?
-Yeah.

267
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,500
Look, I have info on Brasero.

268
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,875
After getting out of prison,
he worked at a restaurant in Paris.

269
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,333
He also saw Callista.

270
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,875
He joined her lame rehab program.

271
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,166
How do you know that?

272
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,125
Hero Tracker.

273
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,708
Best on the market. Expensive.
But the sources are reliable.

274
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,250
-I'll call you back.
-What?

275
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,708
Fuck! Stop that!

276
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,916
-Cut that out!
-Back off!

277
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,458
-None of that here!
-He started it!

278
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,000
That's your last warning!

279
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,666
Put the gear away. We're done.

280
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,250
-Idiot!
-Let it go!

281
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,583
See you tomorrow. Smiling.

282
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,333
Great work, girls.

283
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,083
Let's go!

284
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,833
Alex?

285
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,750
Who's the guy you owe money to?

286
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,666
Who's the guy you owe money to?

287
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,250
-Don't worry, it's cool.
-I am worried.

288
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,916
Leave that, I'm talking.
What's going on?

289
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,750
It's cool, I said.

290
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,958
How do you attract this shit?

291
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,375
-What happened?
-It's not even my problem.

292
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,458
Forget it.

293
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,375
Here. Spare you a beating.

294
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,375
Keep it.

295
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,250
Take it, don't waste my time.

296
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,375
Thanks.

297
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,041
Stop all that, honestly.

298
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,833
-It's not my fault.
-It never is. Go on.

299
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,500
Getting back in shape?

300
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,416
Sounds like hard work.

301
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,625
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm good.

302
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,541
Monte Carlo?

303
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,708
Look in on him.

304
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,833
What's up?

305
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,875
Guys torching stuff all over.

306
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,958
So you came looking here?

307
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,250
Good job, Detective.

308
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,166
Brasero ring a bell?

309
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,541
I helped him when he got out of prison.

310
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,375
We can't find him.

311
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,458
Look harder. What can I say?

312
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,625
You won't help me?

313
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,958
Great to see you, Moreau.

314
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,416
Happy now? Shoes off.

315
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,333
Can I go in?

316
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,833
Yeah, but maybe your feet are sweaty.

317
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,125
Those socks, they leave marks.

318
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,500
-Who's she?
-Rules are rules.

319
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:18,916
I forgot to display them.

320
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,750
What really leaves marks is your bullshit.

321
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,500
It's mind-blowing. Moreau!

322
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:24,541
You know her?

323
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:27,000
Would you mind answering when I call?

324
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,250
Don't bother waiting.

325
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,583
What's so urgent?

326
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,416
Medical examiner wants to see us.

327
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,791
Are you still working with Callista?

328
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:43,333
-Seems fishy.
-"Seems fishy"?

329
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:47,666
Are we back in the '80s?
Are you a thousand years old?

330
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:51,791
She keeps me in the loop.
This is an investigation.

331
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,750
Seeing people, asking questions.
The basics.

332
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,958
Yeah, well…

333
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,125
Answer your phone, that's all I ask.

334
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,708
Brought in after a fire in a squat
a few days ago.

335
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,750
A camping stove, they said.

336
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,041
All right.

337
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,583
What does it have to do with us?

338
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:20,375
His toxicological panel matches
the substance you sent to the lab.

339
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,000
-It was in his blood?
-No.

340
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,291
His blood is the substance.

341
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,125
Establishing cause of death was tricky,

342
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,208
but we finally figured it out.

343
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,000
Exsanguination.

344
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,708
His blood was drained
to make the substance.

345
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:42,291
Puncture marks here and here.

346
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,000
He was fed by a tube.

347
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,625
I think the idea

348
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:47,208
was to keep him alive.

349
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,833
So he had a long, painful death.

350
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,083
Any identification?

351
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,250
Arthur Laguens. Brasero.

352
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:56,250
The neck tattoo confirms it.

353
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,916
Never seen anything like it.

354
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,791
I'd pay to talk with the guy who did it.

355
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,041
He's a genius!

356
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,208
He's not a genius.

357
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,750
A torturer and killer is not a genius.

358
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,375
Excuse me, I…

359
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,041
Brasero's dead?

360
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:29,500
But how?

361
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:30,875
What was his job?

362
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:31,958
Waiter.

363
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,541
Were you happy with him?

364
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,625
He hated being the freak show
for everyone.

365
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,375
People would happily pay
to see him do his…

366
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,583
tricks.

367
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:43,250
You ended it?

368
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,750
Yes, I did.

369
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,291
He refused to use his powers when we…

370
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,208
You know.

371
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,125
Normal guys, boring. Guys with powers…

372
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:54,416
He had a reason for starting therapy?

373
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,375
He'd been depressed since leaving prison.

374
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:01,166
He was withdrawn
and struggled to accept his abilities.

375
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,291
Last time I saw him,

376
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:06,083
he looked in a bad way, he'd lost weight.

377
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,375
I thought, "Another one on a diet."

378
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,666
Not many ladies voting.
All you heroines, hit those comments.

379
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,458
I'd like to thank my sponsor, Rubie's.

380
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,458
If you want to rock the mask
and superhero style,

381
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,125
the best costumes are at Rubie's.

382
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,375
Excuse me, may I?

383
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,541
Yeah.

384
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,458
Lily, right?

385
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:48,000
Enjoying the video?

386
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,958
Yeah.

387
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,541
You're in tenth grade, right?

388
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,500
How's it going?

389
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,041
I know high school can be tough.

390
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:06,958
It's okay.

391
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,541
It's just I weird people out.

392
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,833
Who?

393
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,041
Those chicks over there?

394
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,458
Forget 'em, they're morons.

395
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,916
Look…

396
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:26,791
If you need to talk, look me up anytime.

397
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,083
I'd like that.

398
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,083
Or call this number.

399
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,708
It really helped me.

400
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:40,375
Who is this?

401
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,125
Someone you won't weird out.

402
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:48,000
See ya.

403
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,166
You know what I'm like.

404
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,166
I glide and I slide.

405
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,791
Well, glide out and quit stealing booze.

406
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,208
Promise, buddy. I promise.

407
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,041
Long day?

408
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,916
-Sorry?
-I said, "Long day?"

409
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,333
Yep.

410
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,416
-Go if you want.
-I'm good.

411
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,041
I feel great.

412
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,916
So, triple espresso,
but we're out of Red Bull.

413
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,041
Sorry.

414
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:33,500
Thanks.

415
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,708
No problem.

416
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,625
Get some sleep. Nothing's happening.

417
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,666
Leaving things as they are.

418
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,750
-Thanks.
-See you tomorrow.

419
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,458
Quick question.

420
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:29,000
How many wounded were treated
at the nightclub?

421
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,500
-Five.
-Five? Are you sure?

422
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,166
Shit, there are six on the video.

423
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,333
If you're innocent,
you wait for treatment, right?

424
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,750
On my way.

425
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,291
-How long's he been here?
-Admitted two days ago.

426
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,958
When we saw your alert, he was a match.

427
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,666
This way.

428
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,791
I've got this.

429
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,375
Amine, isn't it?

430
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,916
Lieutenants Moreau and Schaltzmann.

431
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,250
Hi.

432
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,500
-How'd you do that?
-I told the doc.

433
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,500
Burned myself while ironing.

434
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,791
-While ironing?
-Yeah.

435
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:21,958
On your shoulder?

436
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,041
Yeah.

437
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:29,708
Isn't that you?

438
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,500
Can't see zip. Quality's shit.

439
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,250
-"Quality's shit"?
-Terrible.

440
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,041
Maybe we should ask the bouncer?

441
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,666
-What bouncer?
-That one.

442
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,583
In flames and out of a job.

443
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,000
-Don't blame me.
-Shall we bring him in?

444
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,625
Sure, let's get to know him.
I never met him.

445
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:47,541
Wasting your time.

446
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,083
Who's your supplier?

447
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,000
Of what?

448
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:52,125
Who's your supplier?

449
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,791
I'm so sorry! Apologies.

450
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:55,875
Did I hurt you?

451
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,791
Hold on, let's unstick this.

452
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,958
It hurts here?

453
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:04,875
Hurts like hell. But that's nothing
compared to what's next.

454
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,250
What's next?

455
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,041
Well, if we don't find the antidote…

456
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:10,708
What antidote?

457
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,625
You didn't check for side effects?

458
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:16,833
You don't know?

459
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:21,250
Ask your buddy,
the guy you were with at the club.

460
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,625
No, of course, you can't because…

461
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:27,750
by the time we got to him, you know,

462
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,416
he'd exploded.

463
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,708
Bits everywhere.

464
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,666
What I suggest is,

465
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,250
you tell us who sold you the stuff.

466
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,500
We'll find him and get you the antidote.

467
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,750
Or in 24 hours,

468
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,625
we'll see if you explode like your buddy.

469
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:44,041
I want that stuff.

470
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,416
The antidote.

471
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:52,000
Talk.

472
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,208
There was a dude…

473
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:56,708
selling it outside school.

474
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,125
What was his name?

475
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:01,875
His name?

476
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,291
Ismael. His name's Ismael.

477
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,791
-Ismael what?
-I dunno.

478
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,500
He had his head shaved on one side.

479
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:13,666
And an earring.
Maybe lives in Bluebell Towers.

480
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,500
Shall we go?

481
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:19,708
-Moreau.
-Yes.

482
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,958
And the antidote?

483
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:35,750
So, anybody notice some stock is missing?

484
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,666
Any thoughts?

485
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
For example, did anyone think,
I don't know…

486
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,875
"Hey, we're a box short"?

487
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:48,875
Anything like that?

488
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,208
No?

489
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,208
Perhaps someone noticed
Ismael's dropped off the radar?

490
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:04,250
-You don't find that odd?
-The guy doesn't show. Shit happens.

491
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,791
You, shut it!

492
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:06,916
Chewing gum!

493
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:14,041
So, none of you geniuses here
made the connection?

494
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,458
Nobody thinks,
"Stock's missing, a guy's missing,

495
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:19,375
maybe the shithead's fucking us over"?
Nobody?

496
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,875
No, nobody.

497
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:24,958
Except Rudy.

498
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,250
So we're all gonna thank Rudy
for raising the bar.

499
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,291
Thanks, Rudy, for raising the bar.

500
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:40,750
What we're doing here isn't just business.

501
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,666
We're not just here
to make some fucking money!

502
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,291
This is about justice.

503
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,625
There you go. So find Ismael for me.

504
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,291
Wherever he is, find him.

505
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,375
Or I'll shoot one of you.

506
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,791
You. I'll shoot you.

507
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,291
Find him.

508
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,583
Beat it.

509
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:15,416
How's it going with the girl?

510
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,833
-Don't worry, I--
-I'll worry if I want.

511
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,833
-You okay?
-Yeah, you have visitors.

512
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,708
Police! Stop!

513
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,750
Lost him. He went back down.

514
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,375
He's in there. Come on.

515
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,500
Hi.

516
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,791
Do you have…

517
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,916
the cola candy in the little bottles?

518
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:07,125
Not the tangy ones, the others?

519
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,125
Do you have them?

520
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,958
I'll take a look.

521
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,583
Police! On the floor!

522
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,916
He had the stuff on him.

523
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,583
What the heck!

524
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,625
She told me to help myself.

525
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,291
You wanna drive?

526
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,041
Of course.

527
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:06,916
Schaltzmann.

528
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,791
-Thanks.
-After you, sir.

529
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:14,041
Come on!

530
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,583
Shoot! Yeah, shoot!

531
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,875
-You in?
-That shit's dangerous.

532
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:23,916
If it was, why would they sell it?
Plus, it's free anyway.

533
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,041
-Pure profit!
-Not interested, okay?

534
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,166
One hit, and you're a new man.

535
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,166
-Nothing to lose.
-What's going on?

536
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,125
We're waiting for you.

537
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:34,250
Nothing.

538
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,166
-You planning a heist?
-No.

539
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,875
A heist, why go there? We're just talking.

540
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,500
Sure you are.

541
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,000
You coming?

542
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,166
Yeah, just doing my laces.

543
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,333
Right.

544
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,958
Where's this from?

545
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,166
I don't know.

546
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,750
-You don't know?
-No.

547
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,916
What I know is that Brasero is dead.

548
00:40:56,375 --> 00:41:00,750
You like the sound of "homicide"
as an extra line on your résumé?

549
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:04,208
-I don't know.
-Still don't know?

550
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,458
Where's the laboratory?

551
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,291
Well?

552
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:12,625
Forget it. He won't talk.

553
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,791
-Twenty euros says she makes him.
-I'm in.

554
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,000
How many sellers?

555
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,416
I don't know.

556
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,041
That's all you know how to say?

557
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,041
How many buyers did you have?

558
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,833
-I don't know.
-Shit!

559
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,541
Nothing doing, he's playing me.

560
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:42,833
I'll try.

561
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:47,291
Wait! Let's lose the cameras
and leave me alone with him.

562
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,291
From now on, decaf for the lady.

563
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,166
You good? You need anything?

564
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:01,833
Let's have a chat.

565
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,166
Well? Ismael sing for you?

566
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,791
We have a lot in common.

567
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:15,875
Could become my new bestie.

568
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:19,750
He won't say a word.

569
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:21,958
Anything on him?

570
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,916
Conviction for dealing hash, no big deal.

571
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,750
So what do we do now?

572
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,333
We eat.

573
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,041
Seriously, you have a food issue.

574
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,833
Yes, when I'm hungry,
I can't think straight.

575
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:44,583
I'll get us takeout.

576
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:47,541
There's a restaurant I know.
You're gonna love it.

577
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:48,958
Chicken.

578
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,541
-Hot sauce?
-No sauce.

579
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:51,916
-Drink?
-No.

580
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:53,666
Pay over there.

581
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:56,125
Excuse me, are you Mister Cold?

582
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,208
That's me.

583
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:00,083
-Can I get a selfie?
-Be my guest.

584
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,000
Thanks.

585
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:02,000
Henri, no time.

586
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:05,833
At last! How do I get you
to pick up the phone?

587
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,083
-Do I need to grow tits?
-Great idea.

588
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:11,750
Is it true there's a drug
that gives you superpowers? For real?

589
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:15,375
-Looks that way.
-Folks will believe anything!

590
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:19,666
Having superpowers
means having a mission!

591
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,083
With great power comes…

592
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,041
comes great…

593
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:27,208
-It's not…
-I'm going into a meeting…

594
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:30,875
-Wait, I have something for you.
-Go ahead.

595
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:33,208
I've piqued Mr. Detective's curiosity.

596
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:37,416
When I heard Brasero was dead,
no thanks to you, I might add,

597
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,375
I thought I'd see
if there were other missing superheroes.

598
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:43,291
And?

599
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:46,833
Guess what, there's a guy named

600
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,750
"Eclipso the Enchanter."

601
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:49,875
MISSING

602
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,791
Not well-known, small-time conjurer.

603
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,875
Some advertising work, nothing major.

604
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,833
Super uncool, basically.

605
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,833
What's his superpower?

606
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:01,000
Blindness.

607
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:03,125
He blinds people remotely.

608
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,500
A flop, career-wise.

609
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,916
Anyway, more interestingly,

610
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,583
this guy Eclipso

611
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:11,541
has been a no-show the whole week.

612
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,666
Stay here, don't go out!

613
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,291
-You okay?
-I can't see.

614
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,708
-Don't move.
-I can't see!

615
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:33,083
All units, North Precinct under attack!

616
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:34,416
Copy, North Precinct.

617
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,958
All units, request immediate backup…

618
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,250
You okay?

619
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,625
-How many are there?
-I don't know.

620
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:56,833
Don't move.

621
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:57,958
Get out!

622
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:08,375
Guys!

623
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,541
I'm up here!

624
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:15,416
Here!

625
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,041
I'm here!

626
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:22,958
Okay? It's me, Moreau.

627
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,416
Get in there!

628
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:32,666
Bring him out!

629
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,125
Keep going!

630
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,041
-Careful!
-Don't move!

631
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:47,333
Get her!

632
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:48,541
I got this!

633
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,750
-Freeze!
-Grab her, now!

634
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,958
Hands up!

635
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:58,958
Police!

636
00:45:59,041 --> 00:45:59,875
On the floor!

637
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:24,875
Just taking samples of the explosives,
then we're done.

638
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,625
Keep me posted.

639
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:36,708
Better?

640
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:41,708
Any news on Guillot?

641
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:43,500
Yeah, he'll make it.

642
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:50,958
Any left?

643
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,416
She sees everything before it happens?

644
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,125
No, not everything. She…

645
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:01,958
No, she gets these flashes

646
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:05,208
with certain people. Like…

647
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,291
Flash!

648
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,083
Without warning.

649
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:11,083
The flash comes without warning.

650
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,416
And so, did you two…

651
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,958
No.

652
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:19,875
No, are you kidding me?

653
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,375
So, no girlfriend?

654
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:25,625
No boyfriend either?

655
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,125
So, no kids, I guess.

656
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:33,458
How about a fish? A rat?

657
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,875
I have a little cat who's… dumb.

658
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:44,791
What happened earlier?

659
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:51,625
What do you mean?

660
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:57,541
Is there something I should know?

661
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,333
Schaltzmann!

662
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:07,791
They're ready for your statement. Coming?

663
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,250
Listen to me!

664
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,458
I don't wanna die! Why would I lie?

665
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,708
I swear to God, I was working alone!

666
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:23,500
I didn't wanna share the cash,
it was just me!

667
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,208
Chin up a little.

668
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,166
Chin up.

669
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,291
There, stop.

670
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,208
Good.

671
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,291
-What are you doing?
-Hold still.

672
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:42,000
Really suits you.

673
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,750
You won't do it again?

674
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,958
-Got it now?
-Yeah.

675
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:53,833
Kill him.

676
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:56,333
No, stop!

677
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:58,083
Stop! Fuck! Are you serious?

678
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:00,000
Naja, please!

679
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:01,666
Let me go! Naja!

680
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,750
I saw a guy with powers!

681
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,041
Stop. What?

682
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:06,250
I saw a guy.

683
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:08,208
His name's Moreau. He's a cop.

684
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,125
Made a chick float in mid-air.

685
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:11,875
-In mid-air?
-Swear to God!

686
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,000
That's good.

687
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:18,375
What the fuck? Stop!

688
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:24,583
Guys!

689
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:53,958
In mid-air.

690
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:57,791
Find Moreau for me, please.

691
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,875
-Has Alex left?
-No, he's in there.

692
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:08,875
Where are Karim and Vincent?
Better things to do?

693
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:10,958
Don't ask me.

694
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:13,375
Where are they?

695
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:15,791
Forget it, you're not their mom.

696
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,166
Why do I bust my ass for you dopes?

697
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,166
I'm no snitch, that's all.

698
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:23,625
Beat it.

699
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,458
-You three are banned.
-What?

700
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:28,041
-Beat it!
-Hold on, let me explain.

701
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,666
-It's them, not me.
-Who?

702
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,625
I told them I wasn't interested.

703
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,791
Not interested in what?

704
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:41,500
Go easy, guys. This is serious shit.

705
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,041
And it's free, right?

706
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,500
Yeah, free tryout.

707
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,666
-You stoked?
-I'm stoked.

708
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,083
You're not stoked?

709
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,375
Sure, it's just…

710
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,708
We're doing this.

711
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:54,166
-All good?
-You bet we're good.

712
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:51,333
It's me.

713
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:53,833
We gotta review the dosage.

714
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:17,750
Tragedy tonight in northern Paris.

715
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,583
Two teens were found dead

716
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:22,125
after inhaling the mystery substance

717
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,750
that's been circulating recently.

718
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:26,416
After the fire and blinding powers,

719
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,500
a reworking of the formula
has now taken two lives.

720
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,333
Law enforcement recommends caution

721
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:36,750
to anyone coming into contact
with the blue substance.

722
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:43,750
We have wiretaps on Ismael's friends
and a squad is staking out his place.

723
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:45,833
But we've turned up nothing so far.

724
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:50,416
Hold on.

725
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,250
I need your help. It's Lily.

726
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,083
Come with me.

727
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:16,916
All good?

728
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:18,833
Her daughter's missing.

729
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:21,458
Take her statement.
I'll check out her place.

730
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:26,750
Nothing.

731
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:30,208
I found nothing.
They must know she has powers.

732
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,166
We've gotta find her.

733
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,833
Now you want to help?

734
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:39,833
They tested their shit on two of my kids.

735
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,750
They didn't survive.

736
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,833
-I realized that Lily--
-Beat it. Go.

737
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,708
Moreau, call me back.

738
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,125
Let's go.

739
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,208
Not until we know where Moreau is.

740
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:14,208
-Let's go!
-Wait.

741
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:16,125
Wait for what? Let's go now.

742
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:19,041
What the hell? Come on!

743
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:24,041
Now we go!

744
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,416
Drive!

745
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,791
What are you doing?

746
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:33,833
It won't move!

747
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,583
Police! Get out!

748
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,166
Fuck! It's him.

749
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:07,666
Give me the gun.

750
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:10,000
Give me the gun!

751
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,875
Moreau, stay with us.

752
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,208
Stay with us, please.

753
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:14,916
Come on, help me.

754
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,958
Help me!

755
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,375
One, two, three.

756
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,250
Come on.

757
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,375
All right.

758
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:24,458
I'm coming!

759
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,291
Moreau's one of you guys?

760
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,208
We met Moreau on an intervention.

761
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:41,333
Gigaman spotted his potential
and wanted to recruit him.

762
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:48,875
Did you know?

763
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,541
That's how Moreau
became our liaison officer.

764
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,458
Chairmont never knew about his powers.

765
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:03,458
He was so flattered we wanted his help,

766
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,041
he didn't think twice.

767
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,000
How long did you keep it up?

768
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,291
Not long.

769
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,208
Stop!

770
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:38,375
You okay?

771
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:43,166
Get his pal?

772
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:47,916
Have you practiced?

773
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,833
A bit.

774
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:52,666
But I'm not sure if I can…

775
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:55,208
Take cover then.

776
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:56,458
What?

777
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,291
If you can't handle it, I'll go alone.

778
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:05,666
That's close enough.

779
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:06,833
Back up!

780
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:10,208
-Put your gun down.
-Stop or I'll shoot!

781
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:14,083
Put your gun down.

782
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,166
Let me go or I'll kill you!

783
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,958
Don't be a fool.

784
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:22,208
I said stop.

785
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:26,666
Don't move.

786
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,625
Moreau never forgave himself.

787
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,666
He gave up on his powers and…

788
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:36,708
I found another use for mine.

789
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,375
-We should've kept at it.
-At what?

790
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,750
Look at you, Monte.

791
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:45,416
And Lily?

792
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,375
Where does she fit in?

793
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:50,291
She's Gigaman's daughter.
She was five years old then.

794
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:57,958
Moreau had this on him.

795
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,958
A telephone number.

796
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:02,125
Most likely found it at Lily's.

797
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,666
Elisabeth Caghieri.

798
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:15,416
Psychologist
specializing in superhuman abilities.

799
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,500
Hold on…

800
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:18,416
She was Brasero's shrink.

801
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,541
We interviewed her.

802
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,250
-Really?
-Yeah.

803
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:24,166
-I'll call Chairmont.
-And tell him what?

804
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,708
That Moreau has powers
and we played him for ten years?

805
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:28,291
He'll love that.

806
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:30,000
You have a better idea?

807
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:44,791
Thank you. I'm making progress.

808
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:45,750
Gosh, sorry.

809
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:50,000
-No problem, see you next week.
-Okay.

810
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:51,916
Thank you, Doctor.

811
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:57,541
Next.

812
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:02,291
Come in.

813
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:10,208
Why did you need to see me so urgently?

814
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,416
How can I put it?

815
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,291
It's a kind of…

816
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:16,291
knot.

817
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,875
A knot of anxiety.

818
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:21,875
Something that constricts me, literally.

819
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:24,375
A dull pain.

820
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:31,041
You mean the pressure
is too much to handle?

821
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:48,625
-Sit down and we'll talk.
-Can I lie down?

822
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:52,208
Let's get to know each other first.

823
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:54,208
-Of course.
-Take a seat.

824
01:07:57,583 --> 01:08:00,166
So, tell me about your powers.

825
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,583
Could I get a glass of water? I'm…

826
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:05,708
-Yes, of course.
-Thanks.

827
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,166
Be right back.

828
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:37,666
-You're…
-Here.

829
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,666
You're so kind.

830
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:48,666
-Much better already.
-So, your powers.

831
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:52,708
I first became aware of them

832
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:55,708
in April 1976.

833
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:00,250
Dad had gone to buy cigarettes.

834
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:03,583
I never saw him again.

835
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:07,833
Is it not by the depth of his wounds

836
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,750
that one takes the measure of a man?

837
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:15,041
Yesterday, I woke up
floating above the bed.

838
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,708
For the first time in ages.

839
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:21,291
I think you have gained
an enormous amount of control.

840
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:23,750
Often the nightmare wakes me.

841
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:24,875
And then…

842
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:27,750
Their father is living this experience
with them,

843
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,583
sharing this power,

844
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:33,625
and so I feel excluded,
as if I cannot understand…

845
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:37,500
PSYCHOLOGIST SPECIALIZING IN DISORDERS
LINKED TO SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES

846
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:49,125
When you're stressed, the thing to do
is to picture people butt naked.

847
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:50,583
That's my life.

848
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:54,250
Seeing through clothes
means no mystery. My libido…

849
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:58,291
On a day-to day basis, it's too much.

850
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:01,125
I see her naked all the time,
so to rekindle desire…

851
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,375
What scares you?

852
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:10,583
If I tell her, what'll happen?

853
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:15,291
What will she think?
That I'll put her in danger?

854
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:18,333
Your anxiety is over her reaction.

855
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:21,333
Exactly. She loves me as I am.
Without any powers.

856
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:24,666
If I tell her,
it might break something between us.

857
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:27,375
She may think I'm gonna hurt her.

858
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:30,125
Let's continue this next week.

859
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,958
I'll see you out.

860
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:35,625
THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN PROF. DATO
AND DR. CAGHIERI ENDS ABRUPTLY

861
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:38,541
DUE TO AN ETHICAL DISAGREEMENT

862
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,458
Hello, Lily, this is Elisabeth Caghieri.

863
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:51,000
You missed today's appointment.
I'm worried.

864
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,541
Please call me.

865
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:55,666
There he is.

866
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:06,250
She was my most brilliant
Head of Research ever,

867
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:09,458
but we had to sever ties with her.

868
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:12,041
What do you do here exactly?

869
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:14,666
Fundamental research on superpowers.

870
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,708
Identification, analysis,
transmission, reproduction…

871
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:20,458
Anything that helps explain
how it all works.

872
01:11:20,541 --> 01:11:22,666
What's to explain?

873
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,500
You have powers or not, period.

874
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:26,500
Right?

875
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,791
What was Caghieri working on?

876
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:33,791
Molecular and physiopathological causes
of mental illness in superhumans.

877
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:36,166
I don't understand.

878
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:40,125
The link between
psychiatric disorders in superhumans

879
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:41,625
and their powers.

880
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,791
-Mathias, it's me.
-What do you want?

881
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:48,041
Where's Lily? What have you done?

882
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:49,625
Don't worry about her.

883
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:51,500
You promised you'd leave her alone.

884
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,583
I promised no such thing.

885
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:56,083
Your job's done. It's not your problem.

886
01:11:56,875 --> 01:12:00,208
A young boy's parents asked for our help.

887
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:03,000
He had a severe sociopathological disorder

888
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:04,625
due to his induction powers.

889
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:06,000
What powers?

890
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:10,166
Hypnosis,
depriving others of their free will.

891
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:14,458
I see.
Basically, no one could say no to him?

892
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:17,875
The parents had no special abilities.
They were overwhelmed.

893
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:20,083
They wanted us
to rid their son of his powers,

894
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:22,208
thinking that would solve his problems.

895
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:23,416
I refused.

896
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:26,708
It's not our decision to make.

897
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,875
I supplied you enough people.
This has to stop.

898
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:32,875
People?

899
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,833
Morons with two-bit powers.

900
01:12:34,916 --> 01:12:37,000
People are dying. It's gone too far.

901
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:39,833
It's not helping, it's killing you.

902
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,166
All this is your fault.

903
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,083
Look, she's a young girl.

904
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,541
So? You'd give your life for her?

905
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,500
Let me at least check that she's okay.

906
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:57,583
If you want.

907
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,458
And Caghieri?

908
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,708
She conducted the experiment in secret.

909
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:08,041
She meant well.

910
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:10,291
And it worked.

911
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,791
She successfully eradicated his powers.

912
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:18,000
But to no avail. The child went mad
and murdered his parents.

913
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:22,791
He was declared of unsound mind
and institutionalized.

914
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:24,916
We kept it out of the press.

915
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,833
I made sure Elisabeth
never got another research post.

916
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:48,333
Mathias Najarovski, 35 years old.

917
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,458
Goes by Naja.

918
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:52,958
He used Caghieri's skills
to reproduce powers.

919
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:55,666
And I'm betting his hideout
is also his lab.

920
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,166
How many guys?

921
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,875
A dozen, maybe more.

922
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:00,625
Let's do it.

923
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:03,833
How? The hideout's an absolute maze.

924
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:06,750
If they have Lily's powers, it's suicide.

925
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:09,250
-Whatever, we can take them--
-Cut the crap!

926
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:11,833
You have Parkinson's, don't you get it?

927
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:41,000
The police must be looking for her.

928
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:48,375
You're in pain?

929
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:49,833
What do you think?

930
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:55,375
Mathias, she's 15. Let her go, please.

931
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,833
I was ten.

932
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:58,958
Wasn't a problem for you then.

933
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,708
I regret it every day.

934
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:03,291
Keep it up.

935
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:10,541
No, Mathias, don't do that.

936
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:15,125
-You're gonna--
-Don't tell me what to do!

937
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:19,958
Ever again.

938
01:15:23,625 --> 01:15:24,583
All right.

939
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,541
If you want to keep her alive,
she needs Midodrine.

940
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:32,958
Glucose isn't enough
to keep her blood pressure up.

941
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Do it.

942
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,083
You need to wake up now.

943
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:14,875
Without you, it's hopeless.

944
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,666
Can you hear me, Moreau?

945
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:32,791
What's the point of having superpowers?

946
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:39,250
Schaltzmann!

947
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:48,125
-Police.
-I want to speak to an inspector.

948
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:51,083
-What's up?
-It's about the missing superhumans.

949
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:52,708
She's ratting him out.

950
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:55,583
Act fast. He's holding a young girl.

951
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,500
Please hold, putting you through.

952
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:03,625
If Chairmont wades in,
it'll be a bloodbath.

953
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:37,500
More on tonight's latest incident.

954
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:40,541
In Rosny, near Paris, two police officers

955
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:42,708
were attacked by two individuals

956
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,916
who had robbed an ATM.

957
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,500
According to surveillance camera footage,

958
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:52,500
the suspects fired
destructive blue lasers.

959
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:56,625
The two individuals then
caused mayhem in a nearby park.

960
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:00,083
The injured officers
were rushed to a hospital

961
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:03,000
where they remain in a critical condition.

962
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:22,041
We have visitors. Check it out!

963
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:24,333
Rudy, with me. Move it, guys!

964
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:25,875
Wake up!

965
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:30,666
Go stash that!

966
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:32,916
What about those two?

967
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,375
The kid stays with me.

968
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:38,500
Right? You're staying with me.

969
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:40,500
Wake up!

970
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:42,041
Truck keys!

971
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,833
-What about me?
-Improvise.

972
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:47,166
Mess up and I'll mess you up.

973
01:19:27,541 --> 01:19:28,833
Let's go!

974
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,541
Let me go.

975
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:41,291
Put it down, son!

976
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,666
Holy shit.

977
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:29,916
Out of shape, sweetie.

978
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:51,333
I've heard a lot about you.

979
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:53,375
A pleasure to meet you.

980
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:56,583
Go on.

981
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:21,666
Lily?

982
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:45,666
What's that fool doing?

983
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,666
-I'm on it!
-Wait!

984
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:52,375
No problem. Overshot!

985
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:06,708
Let me go!

986
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:36,791
Stay with me!

987
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:38,041
Stay!

988
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,291
Don't leave me alone.

989
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:44,708
We're gonna make it out of here, okay?

990
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:45,625
Together.

991
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,666
Head down.

992
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,166
Move.

993
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:32,250
You owe me an explanation.

994
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:34,750
Everybody in position.

995
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:51,041
Leave us alone now.

996
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:52,750
We're tired.

997
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:02,833
You okay?

998
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:13,958
Hold it!

999
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:06,958
Take him.

1000
01:27:31,041 --> 01:27:36,333
A few days on, let's revisit
Pack Royal's incredible intervention

1001
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:40,166
to rescue two kidnapped superhumans.

1002
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:44,000
As we've learned more
about the past of "Naja,"

1003
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:46,541
one question remains one week later:

1004
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:50,791
Who is the mystery superhero
who overpowered this dangerous criminal?

1005
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:53,666
Who is he? What are his powers?

1006
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:56,291
Nobody has an answer to those questions.

1007
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:59,291
But for sure,
we haven't heard the last of the man

1008
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:01,833
the public has named Titan.

1009
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,166
You okay?

1010
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,125
I brought you these.

1011
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:20,291
My guiltiest pleasure.

1012
01:28:25,583 --> 01:28:27,541
You've got a supername now
and all that.

1013
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,125
I don't know if I could do it.

1014
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:36,916
We can talk if you want.

1015
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:41,833
Rest up.

1016
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:44,958
-Hey.
-Yes?

1017
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:48,541
Thank you.

1018
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:55,166
I cannot keep him.

1019
01:28:55,708 --> 01:28:58,583
Not with his… stuff.
It's against the rules.

1020
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,208
-But, sir--
-Quiet!

1021
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:05,000
You drop out of sight
to lead an illegal investigation.

1022
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:07,750
You put civilians in danger.
I should fire you too.

1023
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,000
I'm reassigning you.

1024
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:15,250
Pack Royal Liaison Officer.

1025
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:19,291
Scram, I have work to do.

1026
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:24,875
We're agreed, right?

1027
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:26,458
You haven't got…

1028
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:27,875
anything special?

1029
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:30,333
No, nothing special.

1030
01:29:33,791 --> 01:29:36,416
-Well?
-Your Air-widget thing doesn't work.

1031
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,125
I keep sending
and absolutely nothing happens.

1032
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:40,833
Hurry, it's started!

1033
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:42,666
Know what? I'll use my old cable.

1034
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:45,041
Nothing like the old techniques.

1035
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:48,708
There we are.

1036
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:50,791
Nine superheroes are still in the race.

1037
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:53,416
In ninth place, look who it is…

1038
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,875
Mister Cold!

1039
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:57,000
Mister Cold, with one breath…

1040
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:58,625
What a has-been!

1041
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:01,083
Retirement's not bad. Nice and quiet.

1042
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:03,583
Moreau shops for you, I cook for you.

1043
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:05,500
Where do you see a retiree?

1044
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,541
Who saved you from that big dope?

1045
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:11,125
God knows what you were doing
with your tiny fists.

1046
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:12,375
Nothing.

1047
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:15,125
I was watching you. Watching you with…

1048
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:16,208
great admiration.

1049
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:17,791
"Great admiration." Right.

1050
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:20,416
Enjoy it, kiddo, because mark my words,

1051
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,250
it's comeback time for Monte Carlo!

1052
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:23,583
-It is?
-Yes.

1053
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:25,583
Maybe get a style makeover then.

1054
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:27,541
-You're talking style?
-Yes.

1055
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:29,250
You, half-punk, half-Smurf?

1056
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:31,458
"Half-Smurf"!

1057
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,708
-All good?
-Yep.

1058
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:40,750
Is Moreau here?

1059
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:42,333
On the balcony.

1060
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:54,958
What are you doing?

1061
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,375
Nothing.

1062
01:30:59,916 --> 01:31:03,000
I'm talking about the beautiful Callista.

1063
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:05,125
She stands in 4th place…

1064
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:07,208
Who's the punk now?

1065
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:08,666
Who's the Smurf?

1066
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,333
Where am I? In…

1067
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:11,750
Fourth.

1068
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:14,750
-Where am I?
-Fourth.

1069
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,125
I wasn't sure.

1070
01:31:19,416 --> 01:31:20,708
My ass.

1071
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:23,458
Online competitions are rigged.
It's a total scam.

1072
01:31:23,541 --> 01:31:25,541
Monte Carlo, you're in!

1073
01:31:25,625 --> 01:31:27,333
-Where am I?
-Third!

1074
01:31:27,416 --> 01:31:28,750
You've been voting, and MC,

1075
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:31,375
Monte Carlo, is your third superhero!

1076
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:32,916
Amazing.

1077
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:35,416
Yeah.

1078
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,583
-Aren't you pleased?
-Me, you know…

1079
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:41,125
As if I take any notice of that.

1080
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:44,750
I see who's headed for first.

1081
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,166
Here.

1082
01:31:46,666 --> 01:31:47,625
What's this?

1083
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:01,458
Where'd you get it?

1084
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:03,583
I had it made for you.

1085
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:06,375
I thought it might come in handy.

1086
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:09,041
And I heard that North Precinct

1087
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:10,916
has a new liaison officer.

1088
01:32:11,666 --> 01:32:13,916
And that she's totally tip-top.

1089
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,791
HOW I BECAME A SUPERHERO

1090
01:39:20,708 --> 01:39:24,625
