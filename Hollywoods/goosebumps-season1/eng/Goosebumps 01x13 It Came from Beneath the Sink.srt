- [ Laughs ]

180
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
So what does the book say?

181
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,200
It says that your weirdo sponge
is actually a grool.

182
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,700
A grool?

183
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,333
What's a grool?

184
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,333
Theoretically, a grool
is mythological creature...

185
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,600
believed to be
a living bad-luck charm.

186
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
- You mean it causes bad luck?
- Exactly.

187
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,433
And then it feeds
on the bad luck it causes.

188
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:23,033
Each time something bad happens
it gets stronger.

189
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,533
Well, that explains all the accidents.

190
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:27,267
Does it say how to kill it?

191
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,667
Mmm, no.

192
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:32,567
- Do you really buy all this?
- Straight from the book.

193
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,067
Just be glad you didn't find a lanx.

194
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,067
- [ Daniel ] A what?
- A lanx.

195
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,267

right out of you.

00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,700

- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

198
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,567
Let's just deal with one monster
at a time, all right?

199
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,200
Why don't we just mail it
to the north pole,

200
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,900
- or drop it in the ocean or something?
- Not a good idea.

201
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,200
If the owner gives a grool away,
the owner dies.

202
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,700
I must be the owner.
I'm the one that found it.

203

That's right.

204

Lucky thing you dug it up
from the garden.
