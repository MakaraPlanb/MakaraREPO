- Yeah.
- How come?

'Cause Camp Nightmoon's

That's why I ran away.

- Remember Dori?
- The girl you came with.

180
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:54,067
Yeah. We went on a hike and
she got mauled by this bear.

181
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,300
But our counselor said it was nothing
and made her walk back to camp.

Dori cried all night. We tried to
help because there was no nurse.

We finally got to sleep.
But when we woke up,

- You think so?
- Maybe for me.

I don't want them to find me, Billy.

I'll meet you back here after lights-out.
