524
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,900
Thanks, Vandal.
Thanks, boy.

525
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,400
Poor Will.

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,900
[ Birds Whistling ]

527
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,400
[ Mom ] Come on, you guys.
You can finish that later.

528
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Okay.

529
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
So, you two start school tomorrow.

530
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
- Yep.
- You'll make some friends.

531
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,900
I hope they have some normal
boys-- Non-werewolf types.

532
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,400
I thought you'd like
the werewolf type.

533
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Now, listen, you two.
We've talked about this.

534
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,400
We know that it was some kind of
a wolf that attacked you that night,

535
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,900
but there is no evidence to
suggest that it was a werewolf.

536
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,400
Except what I saw.

537
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
And you haven't seen will around,
have you?

538
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,900
There has to be
some rational explanation.

539
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,400
Anyway, it's over.

540
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,900
And I know one thing.
I was wrong about Vandal.

541
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,400
With my apologies.

542
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,900
Honey, not at the table.

543
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,900
[ Dad ]
How's he doing?

544
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,400
[ Mom ]
He seems okay.

545
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,400
[ Dad ] Oh, good. Maybe
he's finally over those nightmares.

546
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,900

It's only a dream.
Only a dream.

552
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,900
[ Howling ]

553
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,400
I hope you enjoyed that story,

554
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
and I hope
you weren't too scared.

555
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Remember, there's no
such thing as a werewolf.

556
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,900
Time for me to say good-bye.
Have a scary night, everyone.
