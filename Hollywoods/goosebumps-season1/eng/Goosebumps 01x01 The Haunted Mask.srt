520
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,840
Only you... Carly Beth.

521
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,880
You're the only one 
 who ever wanted them,

522
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,160
the only one who ever loved them.

523
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,600
No! No!

524
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,280
I want it off! 
 I want it off now!

525
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,800
Take it off me!

526
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,720
I hate this face! 
 I hate this face!

527
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,920
Carly Beth... I'm sorry...

528
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,000
but this face is your face now.

529
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,440
No. No! Aah!

530
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
[ Sobbing ]

531
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,600
There may be one possibility.

532
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,640
How many times have you 
 taken off that mask?

533
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,480
Taken off? Once.

534
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,680
- There still might be a chance. 
 - What?

535
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,640
W-well, tell me! 
 We have to take it off!

536
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,840
I cannot take it off. 
 Only you can.

537
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,000
With a symbol of love.

538
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,400
What does that mean? 
 I don't understand what that mean.

539
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,160
Who are you anyway? 
 How do you know all this stuff?

540
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,360
I was the man who created 
 these faces, Carly Beth.

541
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,040
You made them?

542
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,120
- But why? 
 - I was like you.

543
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,800
I did not love myself.

544
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,280
I made these faces 
 to hide behind them.

545
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,840
To hide my thoughts, 
 but the thoughts were inside me.

546
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,920
That's what infected the faces. 
 Turned them into monsters.

547
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,120
Like this one is turning now.

548
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,760
Very soon, it will join the others. 
 Failures on the shelf!

549
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,120
I don't dare show you 
 what's underneath.

550
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,160
Or perhaps I should.

551
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,000
So that you will 
 appreciate who you are

552
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,600
and what you've always had!

553
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,040
No! I want my face back! 
 I want myself back!

554
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,640
Oh, shh! Shh! Quiet. Quiet!

555
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,000
You'll awaken them.

556
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,080
[ Carly ] What's happening?

557

This is me! Go away!

583
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Get away!

584
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,240
You're just a mask.

585
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,440
You're just a mask again.

586
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,880
The symbol of love.

587
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,920
That's what he meant.

588
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,520
A symbol of love.

589
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,000
- Hi, Noah. 
 - [ Crash ]

590
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,400
Carly Beth, 
 please take that mask off!

591
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,320
Please, Carly Beth! 
 Please take that mask off!

592
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,960
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha!

593
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,400
Mom!

594
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,880
There you are. 
 Do you realize what time it is?

595
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,800
I love you, Mom. 
 I really do.

596
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,240
What is it? 
 What happened?

597
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,280
I'm sorry, Mom. 
 I didn't mean to scare you.

598
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,520
I've had a long, weird night.

599
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,080
Everything's OK, now.

600
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,320
Well, why didn't you 
 wear your duck costume?

601
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,840
Why weren't you with Sabrina?

602
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Sabrina called twice looking for you.

603
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,480
Well, let's just say I've learned 
 a lot about myself tonight, Mom.

604
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,230
Oh.

605
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,120
Heh heh heh! 
 Heh heh heh!

606
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,240
Now, Noah, 
 don't put on that mask.

607
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,240
Don't worry. I won't.

608
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,360
- Oh, you two. 
 - Trick or treat!

609
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,760
Heh heh heh! 
 Heh heh heh!

610
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Now that wasn't too scary, 
 was it?

611
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,920
Let's ask my family.

612
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,600
Mom, Dad, what did you think?

613
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,360
I think they liked it. 
 I hope you did, too.

614
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,960
Have a scary day, everyone.
