-to be a Do-Good Trooper?
-Because you were a girl?

62

No. It was because
they thought I had a big head,

I'm busy, Janice. I've got cats.

And I respect that, but you know kids,
how they just won't let go of that thing

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,740
Tim, if you're trying
to get out of doing some work,

167
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,750
the scope of which I did not anticipate--

168
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,120
I'm not, I swear!
I just love my body the way it is.

169
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,250
And that's a beautiful thing, Tim,
but it's not an excuse.

170
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,210
Grab some metal.
You're building character.

171
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,970
[sighs]

[cats meowing]

173
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,890
I'm getting the sense
they don't believe we're cats.

174
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,770
This is the only way
we're gonna find and rescue Jimbo.

175
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,560
We gotta make them believe. [grunting]

176
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,280
[shrieking]

177
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,990

a lot of repressed hostility. Fine!

185
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,680
It's all for Jimbo. It's all for Jimbo!

We did it! We're in!

195
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,590
Let's go get Jimbo! And never speak
of that litter incident again.

196
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,050
Too big. Safe from being robotomized.

197
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,220
[grunts] Tim, that doesn't go on your arm.

198
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,930
And it never will!

199
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,350

[gasps] Wait, look!

207
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,520
-Jimbo!
-Sorry, we have to cat fight now.

208
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,190

210
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,700
[grunting] Tim, I'm going to give myself
a hernia working for this sticker.

211
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,950
Help me move... whatever this is.

212
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,040
I think you mean "whoever."

213
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,790
I think you mean "whomever," and I think
you're not learning your lesson.

214
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,050
Timmy, I know you have
a powerful imagination,

215
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,550
but I need you to remember
why we're doing this.

216
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,840
Because judging a book
by its cover is wrong,

217
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,100
because Mommy's head
was and is of regulation size,

218
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,020
and because you're the best, sweetest,
most helpful little boy,

219
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,640
and you deserve that sticker!

220
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,140
So, what do you say? Should we go earn it?

221
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,980
Hey, Timmy! Miss McCrackin is a nice...

228
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,130
-Jimbo, why are you doing this?
-It's the only way to stay alive in here.

229
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,760
Kitties love violence.

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,720
Barely logical and incredibly asinine.
[grunts]

233
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,480
Sure sounds like cat to me.

234
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,270
Who cares what they want?
We found you. Let's just escape!

235
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,980
I can't go, not without Gwendolyn!

236
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,820
Dare I inquire who Gwendolyn is?

237
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,280
-[meows]
-No. No! You did not get a prison pet!

238
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,790
Jimbo, of all the mistakes!

239
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,250
She's not a mistake! She's the one
who saved me when I first got here.

240
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,710
She showed me their ways,

241
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,090
got me into the cat-fighting circuit,
made them respect me.

-Carry on.

Kelly, is that you? It's Tim.

250
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,830
I sat next to you in art.
We shared watercolors. Are you alive?

251
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,250
Oh, Tim, you haven't cleaned up
any of this.

252
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,330
We really need to get rid of this stuff
if you want that last sticker.

253
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,710
This is bigger than stickers, Mom!

254
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,800
It looks like Kelly, right?
She's been missing all summer.

255
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,470
She went to camp. Can we please
just finish cleaning this dump?

256
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,430
Well, maybe if you worked a little harder,
it wouldn't be such a dump.

257
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,390
I-I didn't mean "dump" dump. [chuckles]

258
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Just a friendly reminder.
Keep your eyes on your own work, or else.

259
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,190
Or else no sticker for Tim?

260
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,990
Sure.

261
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,700
Threatening another adult isn't a crime,
Janice. Except it is sort of, Janice.

262
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,870
So, let's please stop talking
to Mommy about robots

263
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,080
and really hustle, baby, okay?

264
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Are you really gonna choose
some kitten over us?

265
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,710
Uh...

266
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,220

steal kids and turn them into robots!

Honey, Danny Petrosky is a liar
and a moron. I'm sorry, but it's true.

And now, she's got the baby!

Those sweaters you gave me...
they're cat hair?

335
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,970
I wore them to Thanksgiving, around food!
You said they were cashmere!

336
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,350
I clearly said "cat schmear."
You heard what you wanted.

339
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,940
Turns out Miss McCrackin's
been selling cat hair sweaters

340
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,230
at cashmere prices for years.

341
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,690
Wow! And we were the ones who busted her?

342
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,490
-It was all you, sweetie.
-It's just too bad

343
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,120
that I couldn't actually help her and get
that final Neighborhood Service sticker.

344
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,370
You're a Lowly Apprentice Do-Good Trooper?

On your way to Lofty Squire
Do-Good Trooper? [chuckles]

346
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,210
Well, son, you've done more good
for the neighborhood

347
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,260
than any police officer that I ever knew.

348
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,680
That's troubling.

349
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,390
This is awesome! We did it, Mom!

350
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,140
So, lesson learned.
Never judge a book by its cover,

351
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,600
even if it turns out the book is even
creepier and weirder on the inside.

352
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,360
Just read a few pages anyway to be sure.

353
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,900
Is any of this helping?
I'm a good mom, right?

354
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,110
-I like your head.
-Thanks, kiddo.

Oh, Gwendolyn, you're the best pet
a baby could have.

00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:17,000
And we'll be together forever
and ever and ever and ever and ever...

-You can't have a pet, Jimbo.

361
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,560
While this little fur ball
has certainly proven her worth,

362
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,060
she's from the other side.

363
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,140
You understand? I'm sorry.
It's just the way it is right now.

364
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,810
The stakes are too high.

365
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,780
That was a very polite way of telling him
that this is gross and unacceptable.

that puts up the biggest fight?

-There, there, now.
-Wow! You must have the magic touch.

371
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,930
I have always had a special fondness
for kitty cats.

You know, looks like you have your van
and your hands mighty full.

Would you mind if I took this one?
Seems to have taken a real shine to me.

-Uh, strange lanky man, he's all yours.
