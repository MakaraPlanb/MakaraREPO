[Boss Baby] What I've learned from
the airplane incident: Mega Fat CEO Baby,

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,080
that scooting diaper rash,
will stop at nothing to get me fired.

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,000
How do I protect my job? I need a very
big win. But from where? Concentrate.

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,590
-Hey! Here's just the pick-me-up we need.
-[jazz music playing]

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,800
Hot poppin' jazz to keep me awake.

-[music gets louder]
-Nice. Ooh!

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,510
I love that jazz sizzlin'
in my little lady veins. Whoo-hoo! Yes!

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,970
It's eight o'clock. Can you turn to
the Goofball Chuck Nighttime Morning Show?

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,520
That's a no, daddy-o.
This jazz is like coffee for my ears.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,520
-Okay.
-[scatting]

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,570
-"Okay"?
-What? He's my dad. He said no.

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,030
[laughs] "No" is just the first word
in a very interesting conversation.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,240
You have to think of parents
as adversaries

26
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,750
to be sliced to bits
at the negotiation table.

27
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,330
No, you think like that.

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,750
-I think of Mom and Dad as best friends.
-Oh, Templeton.

[siren blaring]

00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,510

Are we gonna get arrested?

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,590
No, Tim.
I don't know why he's pulling us over.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,010
[blaring continues]

33
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,220
Turn off the jazz.
I don't want him to think we're ruffians.

34
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,440
What is it, officer?
Driving too carefully? [chuckles]

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,730
My new partner smelled trouble
and she's never wrong.

36
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,740
Partner! Here, partner!

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,780

-Ain't she cute as a nickel?

But she's also tough as nails.
I call her Cat Cop.

-Cat Cop.

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,010
-[meowing]
-Seems like there's a pretty big problem.

45
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,510
I'm gonna check it out.
Oh, broken taillight.

46
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,390
I'm pretty sure it wasn't broken
when we started driving.

-Hmm. Weird. I'll write you up a warning.
-[meowing]

48
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,900

I should write a full-blown citation?

-Wait, I'm getting a ticket now

50
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,070

-Do you have a problem

51
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,610
with my partner's judgment?

-[gasps] No, officer, sir.

53
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,830
Hey! Goo-goo ga-ga there!
Kind of funny, actually.

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,750
Cat Cop's been having me pull over
a heck of a lot of baby families lately.

55
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,260
I had no idea folks with babies
were such troublemakers.

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,720
Anyway, have a nice night, folks.

[grunting]

60
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,270
[sighs] Now, you're bringing in
the luggage for them?

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,070
-What? I love helping.
-Then come over here and help me.

-[Mom snoring]
-What's up?

63
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm trying to reconstruct what happened
while we were in Paris.

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,030
"Cat Cop given real badge.
Brought on as a police mascot,

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,750
this former stray turned local hero
has quickly proven her worth.

66
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,580
After seeing the little kitten's
savvy nose for crime,

67
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,170
the chief has promoted Cat Cop from mascot
to an official member of the force."

68
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,720
She's come a long way since her legendary
act of heroism in Dangerous Well Park.

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,060
"...said Cat Cop's partner, who's human
and not a cat." This is journalism?

70
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,430
What's this legendary act of heroism
in Dangerous Well Park hoo-ha?

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,980
I don't buy it. Something's rotten.

72
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,650
Look! "Cat saves man from well.
The man had been in the well for hours.

73
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,240

how to save him..."

74
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,530
-Does anybody have a big stick?
-[meowing]

75
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,990
"...when a little stray kitten
came prancing up to the rescue."

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,120
-[all cheering]
-[Boss Baby] No, this doesn't make sense.

77
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,630

in a well?

[both gasp]

-It's Bootsy Calico!
-Of course! Oh, Bootsy, you went too far.

80
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,180
This is perfect! It solves everything.

81
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,850
-Uh... how?
-Stay with me, Templeton.

82
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,730
Calico's plots have always been ruthless,

83
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,190
but up till now, there's been nothing
actually illegal, right?

84
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
Sure?

85
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,530
-"Oh, I'm Bootsy Calico."
-Nuh-uh.

"I opened a cat restaurant
to make people love cats.

Hold it right there, Bootsy!

"Unter gunter! I'm going
to get you fired." Mega fat chance.

so I went back to helping.

No. No, no, no. I can't watch you
throw away your potential like this.

105
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,310
You're coming with me to Baby Corp.
I'm gonna bust Bootsy, protect my job,

106
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,520
and give you your first lesson in...

107
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
power negotiating.

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,730
[voice echoing]

109
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,480
I need Mega Fat CEO Baby to approve
the gold star surveillance package.

110

State-of-the-art equipment,
sweet van, the works.

Isn't Mega Fat's office upstairs?

112
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,450
Rule one of negotiation:
never meet your adversary on their turf.

113
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,000
I thought negotiation was marching in
and being all, "Hey, I want this,

114
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,790
-so give it to me now, dummy!"
-No! Remain cool! Down to earth.

115
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,420
And never ask for what you want.
Ask for more than what you want.

116
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,720
-Let them talk you down.
-Oh, so they think they won.

117
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,970
I call them "smiling salami butts."

118
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,430
So happy,
no idea they've just been sliced to a nub.

119
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,390
There's our target, tossing back cookies

120
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,190
-like he's his own grandma.
-I don't get it.

121
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,360
Neither do I. Let's get that gold star
package. Mega Fat CEO Baby.

122
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,990
The picture of good health.

123
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,910
Oh, Boss Baby, I'm so glad you survived

124
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,990
that airplane incident in which I had
no part you can prove, but I'm surprised

125
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,210
you'd show your chubby cheeks
in here again so soon.

126
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,920
He does have adorable chubby cheeks,
doesn't he?

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,130
Like a dainty chipmunk.

128
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,710
So nice of you to say.

129
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,220
Always a kind compliment
coming from your copious mouth.

130
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,180
Whatever you're buttering me up for,
the answer is no.

131
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,470
I know how to take down
Bootsy Calico's entire operation.

132
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,020
Your request was pre-answered,
and the answer was "no."

133
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,900
Wait, wait. Hold on, Magnus.
My ears are perky.

134
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,940
All I need from you is... the platinum
supernova surveillance package.

135
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,240
Ha! Brown surveillance package for you.

136
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,740
Unacceptable!
Oh, I also need you to make me co-CEO.

137
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,620
That's too funny to laugh at.
I'm going to go ahead

138
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,920
-and keep trying to get you fired.
-So, how about we...

139
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,250
[cracks neck]

140
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,340
...negotiate?

[inaudible dialogue]

143
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,730
Gold star surveillance package. And if
you get Bootsy, I stop trying to fire you.

144
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,900
You get nothing else. Final.
I win. Shh! No more words.

145
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,240
If that's all you can give me.

146
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,160
[snickering] Sucker.
Do you think he heard that?

147
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,580
Mega Fat CEO Baby
has quietly called you a sucker.

148
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,250
You are the best, Magnus.

149
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,670
He's a smiling salami butt!

150
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,590
Meet your new best friend.
Baby's First Book of Negotiation.

151
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,220
Learn it, live it.
I've got gold star surveilling to do.

152
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,850
I deserve this.
I mean, it just feels right.

153
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,440
[panting] Sorry I'm late.
Ooh, we're hugging cars?

-[car beeps]
-All right, you two, listen up.

156
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,530
Step one,
catch Cat Cop in the act of dirty deeds.

157
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,490
Step two, prove that Bootsy
is giving Cat Cop orders.

158
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,950
Step three, let the benevolent tsunami
of job security wash over me.

159
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,540
-Where's Tim?
-He's a little busy...

160
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,750
becoming incredible.

161
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,960
No way this stuff works.
Mom, will you come here, please?

[sighs] Awesome. Thanks.

324
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,870
These tickets are costing us a fortune.

325
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,630
We have no choice
but to sell the house to Bootsy.

326
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,920
Maybe a change will be good for Tim.
He's really been acting out.

327
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,680
Yeah, all that negotiating. I'm starting
to feel like he's taking advantage of us.

328
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,020
[gasps] We're moving. Mom and Dad
turned into angry salami butts.

329
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,520
-We didn't even get Cat Cop's helmet.
-[chuckles]

330
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,270
-What are you so happy about?
-[laughs] We did get the helmet!

331
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,980
-I swapped it out for Football Mike's!
-You can't take Football Mike's helmet.

332
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,320
-That's what gives him football powers.
-Templeton,

333
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,610
we've got Bootsy Calico dead to rights.

334
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,990
My job is safe. Mega Fat CEO Baby
won't be able to touch me

335
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,290
-when I become the hero of Baby Corp.
-But we still have to move.

336
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:54,170
Who cares? It's a simple real estate deal.
You get a new house. Play it right,

337
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,340
and you can turn this into a full bedroom
suite upgrade, with hot tub!

338
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,670
Come on, tiger. Get in there
and negosh like I taught you.

339
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,850
You're just trying to teach me how
to be selfish! I don't wanna be like you!

340
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,730
I'm sorry about everything.
I don't want us to move because of me.

341
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,730
[Mom] Oh, Timmy, it's not your fault.
Come here, baby.

342
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,770
Am I a bad kid?

343
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,320
No! You're the best kid I know.
Come here. Big hug!

344
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,820
[Mom] We love you, Tim, so much.
Nothing can ever change that.

345
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,200
[sighs]

346
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,550
[cats snarling]

347
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,640
Bootsy Calico!

348
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,520
I'm here to negotiate.

349
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,650
Ooh! Baby in a suit.
So, you've come into my lair to negotiate?

350
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,740
I thought you were a smart businessman.
Oh, nice leverage.

351
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,570
Your prints are all over this.

352
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,290
-This is a one-way ticket to prison.
-[gasps] The people pound?

353
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,330
I'm here to do business.

354
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,620
[neck cracks]

355
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,210
So, let's do business.

356
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,500
[neck cracks]

357
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,380
So, I'm pretty much
just gonna give this to you.

358
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,590
All I ask is that Cat Cop is off the force
and you pay all of my family's fines.

359
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,140
Wait a second. What's the play here?

360
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,560
I just want my family to be happy again.

361
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,940
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Family's making you soft, baby man.

362
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,030
Mom and Dad's fines went away,
and the newspaper said Cat Cop quit.

363
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,160
You can go bust Bootsy Calico now.
We'll all be fine.

364
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,250
I can't bust Bootsy anymore.
I gave him the helmet.

365
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,710
What? Why? What about your job?

366
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,750
You really think Mega Fat
has the brains to get me fired?

367
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,630
Just gonna be tougher to beat him now.
Besides, some things are more important,

368
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,340
like proving to your brother
you're not as selfish as he thinks.

369
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,510
Oh, make no mistake.
I'm still selfish, but more self... ish?

370
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,810
Is that Mr. Pineapple's Café?

371
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:21,360
I put a spy camera
in Cat Cop's helmet! [chuckles] Classic!

372
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,900
-[Timmy] What's on the board?
-[gasps]

373
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,320
[Timmy] "Six well-placed kittens"?

374
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,080
It looks like his master plan.
I think that's his master plan!

375
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,540
Six well-placed kittens.
We got him. Let's get to work.
