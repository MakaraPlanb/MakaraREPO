00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,150
You and your impish sidekick
have won Spirit Day... round one.

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,570
-Round one?
-[CEO Baby] Round one.

170
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,490
You may have found the prize walker,
but now you've got to keep it.

171
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,000
-Welcome to surprise round two!
-What?

172
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,120
He can't do that!
That's a whole new round.

173
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,380
All you've got to do is get your prize
back through Baby Corp

174
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,720
to the safe zone on the main floor.
The napping cubicle. Neutral territory.

175
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Whoever gets it there wins...
for permanent realsies this time.

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,010
[groans] We can't let this cheater win.

177
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,230
So, okay, maybe no Slide-N-Splash
or bouncy castle.

178
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,600
Pick your battles, Templeton.

179
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,820
We still get hot dogs, and we'll be back
in plenty of time for Dad's show.

180
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Your call.

181
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Let's roll.

182
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,700
[elevator pings]

183
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,870
Hey, looking good, Double B.
You were born for a walker like that.

184
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,410
Thanks, Hendershot.
Come by and give it a spin later.

185
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,620
Will do. [laughs]

186
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,920
Can't believe you took on the CEO himself.

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,540
-[speaker squeals]
-[CEO Baby] Ahem.

188
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,710
Just a few more announcements
for a few very special employees.

189
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,970
Manager Baby Hendershot,
just wanted to give you a heads-up

190
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,350
that I know about that oh-so-embarrassing
science experiment video you made.

191
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,770
If you don't want anyone else to see it,
I'll need a teensy-weensy favor.

192
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,360
Stop Boss Baby
from reaching the napping cubicle.

193
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,320
[gasps]

194
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,730
[clicking]

195
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,070
Hendershot, how long
have we known each other?

196
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,360
Sorry, Beebs.

197
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,160
Run, Templeton!

198
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,540
Hmm. Let's see. [gasps] Wha...?

199
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,670
Worker Baby Amal writes love poems
about his own diaper?

200
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,460
Should I publish them
in the company newsletter?

201
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,760
Maybe, if he doesn't help
get that baby walker back.

202
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

203
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,430
Oh, triplets!

204
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,140
One of you called the other two
a super-duper bad name.

205
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,470
-[all gasp]
-Um...

206
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,650
-Let's say the green froggy one.
-[both] How dare you!

207
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,850
I was framed!

208
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,780
Stop Boss Baby and I'll tell you
which naughty word he used.

209
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,160
And to all the babies
who've been stealing office supplies,

210
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,080
well, let's say you know who you are,
and more importantly, so do I.

211
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,170
I stealed a whole copy machine!
[gasps] Who told?

212
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,500
Now, the finer points
of your oh-so-dirty laundry

213
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,000
can stay our little secret...

214
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,630
if you stop Boss Baby
from reaching the safe zone.

215
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,970
Show no mercy.

216
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,840
-[all growling]
-[gasps]

217
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,310
[CEO Baby] Happy Spirit Day.
Juice and cookies after work!

218
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,020
Hey! Get back here!

219
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,770
[all yelling]

220
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,940
Come on!

221
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,230
-[Tim whimpers]
-Hold them off, Templeton!

222
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,230
[grunts]

223
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,190
I'm not... [grunts]

224
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,110
-...comfortable shoving babies!
-[babies yelling]

225
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,450
This was your idea.
Wanna win, you gotta shove--

226
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,040
-Water balloons!
-Huh? [yells]

227
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,920
Oh, great.
Accounting had a birthday this week.

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,420
-Don't worry, I've got this! Ugh!
-Templeton!

229
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,170
Keep going! I'll catch up.

230
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,250
Go!

231
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,300
Ah! I can't shove that many babies!
Agh! [grunts]

232
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,260
The cavalry has arrived!

233
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,060
Hose 'em down.

234
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,180
[yelping]

235
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,690
[chuckles]

236
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,820
Staci, when this is all over,
remind me to promote you to something.

237
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,940
Yay!

238
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,700
-[gasps] Other triplets!
-Oh, soil my diaper.

239
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,820
Down with the traitor!

240
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,910
And all who ally with his traitorousness!

241
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,490
Brothers, no!

242
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,620
[screaming]

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,330
-Minefield!
-Hit the brakes!

244
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,170
Brakes!

245
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,710
[Jimbo wincing] Ouch!

246
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,500
-[yelling]
-Boss!

247
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,050
-[Boss Baby] Oh!
-[both grunt]

248
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,010
[groans]

249
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,010
[grunts] You okay?

250
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,890
[groans] My owies have boo-boos.

251
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,270
-Brothers together.
-To the death.

252
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,770
Wait. When did that become
a possibility?

253
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,690
[puffs]

254
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,690
-[both coughing]
-[Amal] Baby powder smoke bomb!

255
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,860
[metal clanging]

256
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,520
[triplet 2] I'm blind...

257
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,190
But my rash feels great!

258
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,110
Where'd they go?

259
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,070
[Tim] What happened? Did we die?
Is this baby heaven?

260
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,200
Baby heaven's dark and spooky.

261
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,750
-[gasps] Tell me we're not in baby he--
-It's an air vent.

262
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,330
We're very much alive. Relax.

263
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,500
-[both gasp]
-Panic!

264
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,420
Hi-i-i!

265
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,590
-Frankie?
-What are you doing down here?

266
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,090
-I gave you a job topside.
-Oh, you did.

267
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,010
But when I saw you were being chased
by that frightful mob,

268
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,140
I used my old vents to save you.

269
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,350
After all, you saved me from a mob once.

270
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,600
We should hang out sometime
without mobs.

271
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,350
-What time is it?
-Think we're missing hot dogs?

272
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,940
-We might even miss Dad's show.
-No way. We'll get there.

273
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,030
But if we leave, Mega Fat CEO Baby
gets everything he wanted.

274
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,030
All of this would be for nothing.

275
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,240
I told you, you can't fight every battle.
Sometimes the cheating bullies win.

276
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,500
-You accept it and move on.
-I don't accept that.

277
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,170
Cheaters and bullies do not win.

278
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,130
Remember what Dad said
about rock 'n' roll and not giving up?

279
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,500
Technically, the bass guitar
instructional video said that.

280
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,630
Did he get blisters? Yes.

281
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,390
Are his fingers infected
and super gross? They are.

282
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,260
But did he give up learning his song?
Never!

283
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,600
I just wanna say I have no idea
what's going on,

284
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,150
but it's been great
to be part of this moment.

285
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,440
[crowd cheering]
Go, Ted! Go, Ted! Go, Ted!

286
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,530
Go, Ted! Go, Ted! Go, Ted!

287
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,440
Whoo! That's my man!

288
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,240
-[man 1] Way to go, Ted!
-[man 2] Yeah!

289
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,450
-Yeah!
-We love you, man!

290
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,580
Uh, I'm gonna need five more minutes.

291
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,620
-[man 3] Oh, man!
-[crowd groans]

292
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,500
What do you mean, disappeared?
Whose fault is this?

293
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,210
Come, come. Show of hands
so I can smack them, you naughty babies.

294
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,720
Where is my fancy prize walker?!

295
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,430
Guys, I need it for winning!

296
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,060
-[beeping]
-Wha...?

297
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,140
Vroom-vroom, Mega Fat CEO Baby.

298
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,440
Block the napping cubicle finish line!
If Boss Baby tries to cross it...

299
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,150
you make him pay with ouchies.

300
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,330
No! I can't do it. Boss Baby's my friend.

301
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,080
How touching.
And now, I'm touching this button

302
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,920
that spills your darkest secrets.
Shabowza!

303
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,800
This will be my seventh attempt.
The world must know what it's like.

304
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,960
Oh, no!

305
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,470
-[crowd gasping]
-[gasps]

306
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,220
-[worker] Ew!
-[crowd gasping]

307
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,060
He's gonna eat it.

308
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,600
[workers gasping, shouting]

309
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,730
-[worker baby] Ew!
-Oh! There it goes.

310
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,770
It was delicious!

311
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,150
[groans]

312
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,820
Anyone else want their secrets spilled?
Amal's diaper love poems, perhaps?

313
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:34,200
Ahem. "You wrap me up like a blanket.
But, like, with more stank-et."

314
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,620
Stop! I'll do anything!

315
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,500
-Yeah, me too!
-Me too.

316
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,410
Me too.

317
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,000
And I'll take back
that prize walker myself.

318
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,800
[man 1] Ted, you're my idol!

319
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,130
-[man 2] Go, Ted!
-[man 3] Ted rules!

320
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,050
This is for my boys... wherever they are.

321
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,890
[thumps]

322
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,390
[bass music continues]

323
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,190
[spits]

324
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,820
Why are we all standing dramatically?
Somebody give me pushes!

325
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,740
-All aboard!
-Let's ride.

326
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,540
Almost got him. Faster!

327
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,340
Sir, we'd go faster
if you'd use your feet.

328
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,220
You're doing fine. Now board them!

329
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,050
[grunts]

330
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,680
[groaning]

331
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,100
[CEO Baby] Cut them off!

332
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,650
-Get the walker!
-They're pulling ahead!

333
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,320
Steer for me. This machine
needs $700 Italian loafer power.

334
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,900
[Boss Baby panting]

335
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,450

I'll handle them.

341
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,890
-Wait. No!
-Let him go. It's a family matter.

342
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,560
-We don't have to fight.
-You called us a bad name!

343
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,100
-Yeah, you ding-dong!
-Now you called me a bad name!

344
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,350
What a chowderhead.

345
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,900
-Hey!
-Oh, great. Now we're all angry!

346

-We should wrestle!
-Yeah!

347
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,690

Ah, simple little man-baby.

355
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,050
How does it feel
knowing you're slowing Boss Baby down?

356
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,140
You'll never fit in. Your shirt's boring.
I don't like your laugh.

357
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,890
-Is this making you want to quit?

than a job pushing some baby walker?

360
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,980
-No.
-Join me, Jimbo.

361
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,320
-I don't wanna!
-[doll squeaks]

362

-Can I tempt you with a soft bear toy?
-A little, but not enough!

363
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,740
Give it up, Mega Fat. Jimbo's loyal.

364
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,870
Ah, but are you loyal?
I know how ambitious you are.

365
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,670
You could be more
than field team scary tough girl.

366
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,340
Boss Baby isn't your superior.
He's just another obstacle.

367
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,260
Join me, Staci.
The apprentice always overthrows the boss.

368

-It's your corporate destiny.

376
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,740
-I am not betraying my team!
-Glad to hear it.

377
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,990

End of the road, Boss Baby!

382
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,550
Ha-ha. Care to surrender now
and save yourself a lot of pain?

383
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,260
-Please say no.
-We're never gonna get through them.

384
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,090
Stay here. Tim and I have to finish this.

Nothing personal.
Mostly a weight thing. You'll see.

For the record,
it was a heck of a show.

oh, I should've picked my battles.

-But I thought I could--
-No excuses, young man.

You're grounded all week.

Hope whatever fun you were having
was worth it.

436

Upstairs, and give me the baby.

Hey, uh, Dad.

I'm really sorry the baby and I
missed your show.

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,220
I know I'm grounded,
but I was thinking,

00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,470
if you played really loud, the baby and I
could hear it from our rooms.
