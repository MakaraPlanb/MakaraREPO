and I was so surprised, like-- [gasps]

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,340
This morning?

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,960

There's no such thing as "free,"

And that's just one baby.
We have 13 on this flight.

66
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,230
One baby cries,
it starts a chain reaction.

67
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,310
Baby after baby after baby, shrieking,
wailing, passengers trapped inside

68
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,900

around this flying metal tube!

No. But 13 on one plane?

Oh-ho-ho-ho,
Channel 8's gonna be all over that.

It'll go nationwide. Global!

they called in an ambulance,
