Focus, Templeton. Facts on the ground:

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,040
We've got Bootsy Calico,
a madman raised by kittens.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,160
He wants to make the world love cats
more than babies, which is...

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,830
[laughs] ...ridiculous.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,880
Cats make doody in boxes.
Boxes, Templeton!

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,670
Like medieval England
or modern-day Canada.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,090
No. Bootsy has to play dirty to win.
So what's his play? Is it a game changer?

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,930
Is he changing the game? It's the game!
He's changing it. [whooping]

22
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,600
This is a roller coaster
of corporate intrigue.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,100
You keep saying "play" and "game"
and "roller coaster."

00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,570
-Do you know what any of those are?
-He's no fool.

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,150

-Not even a chance. Trust me. Ow!

Got a coupon for tonight's grand opening
of a new family restaurant.

42
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,250
And since it's been a while
since we left the house,

43
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,000
we figured our wittle baby might be weady.

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,750
Is the baby weady to weave the house
without making a big fuss?

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,220
-"Weady to weave the house" for what?
-Templeton Family Fun Night!

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,800
[gasps, shrieks] Family Fun Night!

Wait. You're not lying, are you?

49
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,940
Because sometimes
people talk about roller coasters,

50
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,270
but there's no real roller coaster, just--

Mom and Dad just relax, and we joke around
and have an awesome time.

I'd love some family QT,
but it's not a good time.

Think Bootsy Calico's taking a night off?

60
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,760
No, he's plotting. I have to counterplot
to keep babies number one.

-You're a baby.
-And like all babies,

I'm trained in the art
of obstinate resistance.

69
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,700

50 pounds of weight by going limp?

This is going to be so much fun
once the baby calms down!

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,360
I'm not gonna do this the any way.

168
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,450
[sighs]

169
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,620
Forgive me, Baby Corp.,
and babies everywhere. [screeching]

170
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,500
-What's wrong with the baby?
-What did you do to the baby, Tim?

171
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,500
Nothing.

172
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,340
[Dad] Shh. Shh. Baby want some toys?

173
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,920
Hmm? [growls]

174
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,430
-[crying continues]
-[chuckles]

175
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,430
This is so embarrassing. The anchorwoman
from the news just gave us a look.

176
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,640
[gasps] Marsha Krinkle is here?

177
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,020
-Channel Eight, "Eye on the News."
-[gasps]

178
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,930
Big fan.

179
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,350
Let's focus on calming the baby.

180
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,650
-Maybe we should go.
-We can't just leave!

181
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,690
It's okay. We haven't even ordered yet.

182
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,740
No!

183
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,490
-[gasps] Timothy Leslie!
-I will not let Family Fun Night end.

184
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,450
The baby just needs to work off energy.
I'll see if there's a ball pit.

185
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,830
See? Enjoy some quiet time.
Pick yummy appetizers.

186
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,840
Remember, I don't like anything
with cheese on the inside,

187
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,210
but I love everything with cheese
on the outside.

188
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,430
Uh, well, if it means that much,
we'll give it a shot.

189
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,510
-I am getting into this ukulele kitten.
-Back in a bit.

190
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,980
Ugh!
Thanks for getting me out of that hotbox.

191
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,190
Let me just call in some backup-- Hey!

192
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,820
What's the play here, Templeton?
Torture? You don't have the stones.

193
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,030
You made a choice. You joined a family.

194
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,240
Here it comes.

195
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,740
This is Family Fun Night,
and this place is really, really fun.

196
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,670
This place is fun?
It's a breeding swamp for cat love.

197
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,330
We need to burn it down.

198
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,920
Just give us one hour, okay?

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,630
Tomorrow, you and me versus Bootsy Calico.

200
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,090
Tonight, put your work away and have fun.

201
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,760
[laughs] You're talking gibberish.
Who has fun when work's put away? [grunts]

202
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,690
We are not leaving this car
until you promise to enjoy yourself.

203
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,150
[sighs] Fine. I promise to enjoy myself.

204
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,110
-With family stuff.
-With family stuff.

205
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,820
You're an inspiration. Amen.
Throw the confetti. [blows raspberry]

206
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,820
Can I just... [inhales sharply]

207
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,990
Can I get a moment to compose myself?
Alone?

208
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,910
Okay.

209
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,790
Staci, Jimbo, pinging my coordinates.
I need you here now.

210
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,590
Sorry, Templeton.

211
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,760
[Dad] Whoo, whoo! Pineapple! Pineapple!

212
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,640
-Yeah! Sing it, Mr. Pineapple!
-Isn't this the best?

213
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,430
A thrill. I've always dreamed of
passively observing Mommy and Daddy

214
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,100
-turn into mindless kitten-lovers.
-Shoot us some mellow vibes!

215
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,560
Your appetizers.

216
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,860
Remember, no utensils, no hands.

217
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,690
-So fun! [slurping]
-[both gasp]

218
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,530
-Kitty living.
-[both laughing]

219
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,450
[slurping]

220
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,080
-Ugh!
-[Staci] Sir!

221
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,290
[grunts]

222
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,090
[both sigh]

223
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,720
Talk to me.

224
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,390
You weren't kidding.
Cat love is off the charts.

225
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,850
[monitor beeping]

226
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,860
This whole place is bad news.

227
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,530
-I know that. Find me good.
-Hi. I'm good.

228
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,940
Yes, Jimbo, you're a very good boy.

229
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,570
[chuckling]

230
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,410
I need intel on this Mr. Pineapple.

231
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,280
Why so laid back?
How is Bootsy taming him?

232
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,830
-[Jimbo giggles]
-[grunts]

233
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,460
I see his food bowl.
Some fancy-schmancy clam platter.

234
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
Shellfish. A kitty delicacy.

235
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,550
-What kind of clams?
-[Staci] Sending a pic to the lab now.

236
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,220
Is it an elephant?

237
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,970
[both] No.

238
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,390
Is it a giraffe?

239
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,800
[both] No.

240
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,100
Is it a Shanghai penguin clam?

241
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,020
[both gasp]

242
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
[all giggling]

243
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:22,360
They're the world's most yummiest clams,
and also super illegal in this country.

244
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,360
Bootsy's got Pineapple hooked on clams
only he can provide.

245
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,860
That's how he's trained him.

246
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,070
Those clams are the key
to this whole operation.

247
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,540
-If we control them...
-We control Mr. Pineapple.

248
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,160
And we can shut down
this whole kitty love fest.

249
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,330
On it. Jimbo's already figured out how
to get past the guard.

250
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,130
-[growls] I'm a dirty mouse.
-Seems solid. Get those clams.

251
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,680
And lure that feline folk singer out
before he turns the crowd into cat lovers.

252
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,470
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Cat style!

253
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,350
-[chuckles] Oh, I will beat 'em.
-[baby babbles nearby]

254
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,350
Shush, honey. Mommy and Daddy
are trying to watch the kitty.

255
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,560
Gah!

256
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,280
[monitor beeps]

257
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,070
-This plan of yours, it had better work.
-[Staci] Yeah, it already didn't.

258
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,870
Jimbo got too deep into character.

259
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,290
Now he's stuck in the glue traps
he set for the actual mice.

260
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,410
[grunts]

261
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,040
Uh-oh.

262
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,830
Sorry to do this to you, BB,
but we need an extra set of legs.

263
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,540
[whispering] And brains.

264
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,800
-Can you get away?
-[Hawaiian guitar music]

265
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,210
I'm dying to.

266
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,760
-[grunting]
-[Mom] Oh, honey, look!

267
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,510
The baby's trying to dance.
He loves Mr. Pineapple's music too.

268
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,940
-Care to show him how it's done, milady?
-Yes, I do, migentleman. [giggles]

269
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,310
[Hawaiian guitar music continues]

270
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,860
[grunting continues]

271
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,150
Curse these German engineers
and their impeccable baby-proofing.

272
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,070
[grunts]

273
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,780
[Tim grunts]

274
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,040
What is this?

275
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,080
Uh...

276
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,830
Templeton, I respect you too much
to tell you a lie

277
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,670
that I can't come up with anyway.

278
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,550
Just help me down, let me defuse
this Calico/Pineapple situation,

279
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,180
and boom, right back to family fun.

280
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,470
Come on. Uppies?

281
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,350
-You lied to me!
-[Marsha clears throat]

282
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,520
Do not make me come over there.

283
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,600
[both grunting]

284
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,940
[Staci thuds]

285
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,360
-Yay! [giggles]
-[grunts]

286
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,740
[Staci groans]

287
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,360
-Forever hugs.
-[growls]

288
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,780
You promised me.

289
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,410
Tonight is about family. I thought
a businessman is only as good as his word.

290
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,870
Yes. In business,
my word is gold-plated and triple-A rated.

291
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,580
My word as a family man, I'll admit,
kind of garbage. But I will work on that.

292
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,090
I promise.
Give me that! Give it back, Templeton.

293
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,260
[snores]

294
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,510
Did you just fall asleep?

295
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,720
Tai chi meditation! Ya!

296
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,810
-[grunts, screaming]
-[chuckles]

297
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,810
[gasps]

298
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,310
Uh, situation update?

299
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,150
We got a... yelling kid,
some... sporadic dancing.

300
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,280
[man over radio]
Are those clams still safe?

301
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,160
Situation update...

302
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,030
I am fired.

303
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,410
BB, we got the clams.

304
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,540
Give me a second.
I'm dealing with the kid.

305
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,790
[yelling]

306
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,790
-[man] Oh, come on!
-Tim.

307
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,800
Hi. I'm TV's Marsha Krinkle,
and here's the news.

308
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,300
Control your children.

309
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,880
I am so sorry.

310
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,970
[indistinct complaints from patrons]

311
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,260
-Big fan. Uh...
-Ugh!

312
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,180
[sighs]

313
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,810
Tim, honey, knock it off.

314
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,890
What? The baby started it.

315
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,150
[caterwauling]

316
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,610
Oh. Oh, heavens, no, Mr. Pineapple.
It's not your fault. Are you all right?

317
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,860
-[screeches]
-[Bootsy] You need your din-din. Okay.

318
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,580
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Pineapple
is going to take a short intermission.

319
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,000
Why? Because children ruined everything.

320
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,670
Yeah. Specifically,
that family with the baby.

321
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,880
-Oh, boy.
-Boo!

322
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,920
Yeah, time to go.

323
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,670
-[crowd booing]
-[meows]

324
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,510
The crowd's turning on us.
Baby love is cratering.

325
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,470
Lure Pineapple out of here!

326
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,970
[meows]

327
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,470
[confused meow]

328
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,020
-[mournful cry]
-[Staci] Hey, Pineapple!

329
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,400
Come and get 'em, you filthy animal.

330
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,900
[snarling]

331
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,150
-Jimbo, break for the exit!
-[whimpers] Where is it? I don't see it--

332
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,400
-[grunts]
-[Mr. Pineapple yowls]

333
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,320
-[chuckles]
-[Bootsy] All done with num-nums?

334
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,410
[Mr. Pineapple grunting]

335

-How much do we owe for the clawb salad?
-No! Don't pay the bill yet.

345

We're sticking this out as a family.

No! Give me that.

-Hi. Do I need to speak with somebody?

349
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,250
I am so sorry, TV's Marsha Krinkle.
We're getting the kids out of here.

350

[grunting] Why... do you have to...
ruin... everything?

This just in:

352
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,980
You're a noisy, mess-making monster
and your parents should be ashamed of you.

You are one smart little baby, aren't you?

368
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,700
Oh, I know lots of things. I know the sky
is blue, I know the cow goes moo,

369

as a mellow cat. [snaps]
