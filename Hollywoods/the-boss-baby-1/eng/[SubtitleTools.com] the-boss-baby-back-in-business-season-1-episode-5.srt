[Boss Baby] Next item,
the Little Dumpling Pageant.

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,090
Baby Corp runs
the Little Dumpling Pageant?

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,960
No. That's exactly the problem.

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,380
May I infer from that voluminous spit take
that you're a fan of the pageant?

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,260
I wouldn't say I'm a fan.

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,270
More like a former winner and champion.
But I don't like to brag about it.

18
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,770
So, what's up?
Something wrong with the pageant?

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,390
The pageant itself, no.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,070
Little Dumpling is the crown jewel
of the baby pageant circuit.

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,190
A whole town coming together
to celebrate its cutest baby?

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,570
That's solid gold dynamite for baby love!

23
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,570
Look at these historical charts!

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,580
-Outstanding charts, sir!
-What am I looking at?

25
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,540
Doesn't matter. It's the past, garbage!

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,830
Because the problem
is our reigning Little Dumpling champion,

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,460
last year's winner...

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,130
Jarreau McIntosh. [spits]

29
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,420
You really are super into this pageant,
aren't you?

30
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,010
I care about honor.

31
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,010
That crown used to mean something
when I was a champion, which I was,

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,390
-but I don't like to brag about it.
-Yes, Jarreau McIntosh.

33
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,270
Please refer to slide one in your dossier.

34
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,230
[Boss Baby] Cute, sure, but Jarreau really
killed it in the talent competition.

35
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,730
Pot-and-pan drumming.

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,490
He could bang those wooden spoons
like Zeus slinging lightning from Olympus.

37
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,110
[Jimbo] I got his poster.

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,620
We all got his poster, Jimbo.
And then the wheels fell off the tricycle.

39
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,290
Next slides. Jarreau wasn't cut out
to be a Little Dumpling winner.

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,580
When he put on that crown, the fame
went straight to his cherubic head.

41
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,880
He's an embarrassment to baby-kind.
I can't even look. Stop clicking! Stop it!

42
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,920
[sighs] Bottom line,

43
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,470
we can't let another Jarreau McIntosh
win the pageant this year.

44
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,720
Sir, couldn't we just shut
this thing down?

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,390
Cutest dimple, softest bottom. How do you
even decide who wins something like that?

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,810
Competition is what made
this country great, Staci.

47
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,570
Exactly. So why not do it
like we did in day care?

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,610
Twenty babies crawl into the ball pit,
one crawls out.

49
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,120
Come get some, Brayden! [grunting]

50
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,330
Thank you
for considering my proposal, sir.

51
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,330
We're not shutting the pageant down
for some bare-knuckle baby free-for-all.

52
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,380
We just need to make sure this year's
winner is someone Baby Corp can trust.

53
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,590
A ringer from our very own field team.

54
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,220
Oh, I, uh... [chuckles]

55
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,890
I know I'm a proven champion,
but do they let non-babies enter?

56
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,970
Move out of the way.
You're blocking Jimbo. It's Jimbo.

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,980
-Our ringer is Jimbo.
-Yay!

58
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,310
Oh, sure. That makes sense.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,060
It's a slam dunk.

60
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,650
Look at that specimen
of adorable babyhood.

61
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,070
Thirty-six vertical inches

62
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,280
-of solid plump and snuggles.
-[giggling]

63
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,740
Most importantly, someone who knows
how a baby should behave.

64
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,330
Say something inspiring, Jimbo.

65
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,410
-Marbles go in hands, not in noses.
-See? He's a role model.

66
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,380
-I'm gonna be like Jarreau McIntosh.
-Oh! No, not like Jarreau!

67
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,010
The exact opposite of Jarreau!
We literally just talked about this!

68
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,510
[sneezes, sniffles]

69
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,140
-[chuckles]
-It's a solid plan. He'll be fine.

70
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,430
Let's hit that pageant!

71
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,100
[chattering]

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,650
Why does your brother look like Halloween
just threw up on his face?

73
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,650
You want someone to recognize me?

74
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,660
My famousness could blow
this whole operation.

75
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,870
I like the enthusiasm, Templeton.
Registration table's over there.

76
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,790
-Ooh, snacks!
-Good thinking, Jimbo.

77
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,250
Plump up those jiggly, giggly tummy rolls.
We'll scout the competition.

78
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,460
[sputters]

79
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,670
Wipe yourself off.
You're embarrassing us all.

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,630
I don't get this.

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,840
Babies just act like babies,
and some judge says,

82
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,970
"Uh, this one's the winner"?

83
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,770
Jimbo's got this in the bag. [chuckles]
That one thinks his toes are food.

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,150
[gasps] Whoa! We have a contender.

85
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,860
That's the booger-free princess to beat.

86
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,950
-You can say that again.
-I never repeat myself.

87
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,820

Jarreau McIntosh. [spits]

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,090
-He's an actual train wreck.
-Come on.

95
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,630
Let's talk strategy. The sooner
they pass that crown to a new champion,

96
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,270
-the sooner my migraine goes away.
-[gasps] It's him! [chuckling]

97
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,350
Jarreau! [chuckling]

98
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,400
I love your drumming. It's so loud.

[coos, giggles]

102
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,620
With you?

103
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,870
Yes, I would love to get out of here!

104
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,660
-Huh?
-[mimics deeper voice] Adult hello.

105
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,420
[chuckles] Aren't you just adorable?

106
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,380
[chuckles]
Not like a former pageant winner.

107
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,170
Nope. I'm just here
to register my son, Jimbo.

108
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,220
Okey-doke... sir. Last name?

109
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,550
-Jimbosdad?
-Uh-huh. And how would I spell that?

110
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,890
Uh...

-J... imbo mustache boomerang!

-Choo-choo!

116
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,700
[Staci] Jimbo's leaving with Jarreau!

117
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,830
No. No, no, no!
They're about to start the pageant!

118
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,040
[sighs] Jarreau McIntosh.

119
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,000
Templeton, you want to salvage
the dignity of this pageant?

120
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,420
More than anything ever.

121
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,470
They literally can't crown a new winner
without the crown.

122
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,470
-What new winner? Jimbo's gone too.
-Forget Jimbo.

123
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,760
Looks like I'm gonna have to win
this pageant myself...

124
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,560

Oh, please, stop.
We're here for the babies.

131
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,580
They are the future. But not the present.
The present's still me.

You all know me. Am I right?

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,420
I'm on billboards on the highway.

134
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
[laughing] But enough about me
for a few minutes.

135
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,430
Let's crown this year's Little Dumpling!
Come on! Yeah!

136
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,340
Let's see which of these happy,
bouncing babies

137
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,310
isn't attractive enough to continue.

to look at anymore.

Better get your head in the game, Stace.

away from elimination.

-I don't even like this pageant!

Jarreau's crown, and then-- Ow!

169
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,660
-Sorry.
-That's okay. I just... Hey!

170
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,540
I meant, sorry,
you can't take Jarreau's crown.

171
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,330
-I'm his bodyguard.
-What?

172
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,840
Don't worry, Jarreau. [grunts]
I will never let anyone hurt you.

173
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,140
-Hi!
-I'm not trying to hurt Jarreau.

174
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,270
But if you take his crown,
he is gonna hurt, on the inside.

175
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,850
Give it! [growling]

176
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,020
[grunts, groans]

177
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,070
[both grunting]

178
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,030
What the...?

179
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,120
Run, Jarreau!

180
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,420
-[grunting] Oof!
-[Jimbo] Sorry, Tim. I'm so sorry!

181
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,380
[grunts, groans]

182
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,840
[Staci] Ow! Ow! Ow!

183
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,140
-Ta-da!
-[gasps] You're a vision.

184
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,520
-[shrieks]
-Um, maybe lose the stickers.

185
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,100
[all groan]

186
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,940
[Staci screaming]

187
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,440
-All right. Feel like a winner yet?
-Sir, I am a winner. I like to win.

188
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,400
Put me in a ball pit, and I will crawl out
right over Brayden's stupid face!

189
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,200
Give the executive summary.
Clock's ticking.

190
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,120
How am I supposed to win something
that's totally pointless?

191
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,330
Pointless? The point is baby love.

192
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,620
Win this pageant,

193
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,710
and you're the new face of babies
everywhere.

194
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,920
We need you, Staci.
Your company needs you.

195
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,340
Now, get out there
and you find the way to win.

196
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,350
-[babies cooing]
-[audience] Aw!

197
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,270
Ha! They think their reflection
is another baby.

198
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,100
Isn't that just so simple
and precious, folks?

199
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,650
-[all] Aw!
-Take a good look while you can, kids.

200
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,030
All glory fades.

201
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,830
[screams]

-[shrieks]
-[buzzer]

203
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,710
Mirror, mirror, on the floor,
show that kid the door. [laughs]

204
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,920
And just like that,
one more baby goes down.

205
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,180
Yes! Another lucky break.
Stay in this, Staci!

206
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,970
[cackles] Game on.

207

-[audience gasps]
-[buzzing]

209
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,310
Whoa! Talk about a fall from grace!

210
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,240
[chuckles] Get it? Seriously,
someone check and see if that baby's okay.

211
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,450
Uh, maybe too far.

212
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,990
-[Tim grunting]
-[Jimbo] Look at him.

213
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,870
-That crown is all he's got.
-But we need it.

214
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,170
-We're supposed to be fixing the pageant.
-We need to fix Jarreau.

215
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,750
He's a broken baby. If he felt better,

216
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,170
-I bet he'd give you the crown.
-[sighs] Fine. How do we fix Jarreau?

217
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,470
Through open, constructive dialogue.

218
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,180
[blabbers incoherently]

219
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,350
-That's it. Let out all your feelings.
-You know I don't speak baby, right?

220
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,100
-I can translate.
-[continues blabbering]

221
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,780
[Jimbo] "I guess maybe
it all went wrong right after the pageant.

222
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,360
Mommy and Daddy bought me a new toy
as a reward for winning.

223
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,240
It was real shiny,
with a hand crank on the side.

224
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,700
I turned the crank... and bang!"

225
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,700
[cackling]

226
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,170
[Jimbo] "It spooked me so bad,
I decided life is short.

227
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,420
I gotta hold on to everything I've got,
you know?"

228
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,460
[blabbers incoherently]

229
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,720
"I'm not a bad baby. Just scared."

230
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,050
He said all that?

231
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,220
-I added some color.
-[blabbering continues]

232
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,850
Stupid jack-in-the-box.
I wish I could show it what's what.

233
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,730
[gasps] I think I know
how to help him give up that crown.

234
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,320
This next round will test how cute
these little nuggets can be

235
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,320
when faced with the unexpected.

236
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,150
A sour lemon.

237
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,450
Or, as they say in Sweden, a "sur citron."
I know facts. I'm a journalist.

238
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,200
[babies babbling]

239
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,660
Who keeps sugar straws in a diaper?

-[slurps, groans]
-[audience] Aw!

[whimpers]

242
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,220
[all] Aw!

-[sputters]
-[grunts, spits]

244
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,100
[Staci] Enjoy the sweetness, baby.

245
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,690
[Marsha gasps] Oh, my!

246
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,980
[all groan]

-[buzzing]
-Guess not everything babies do is cute.

249
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,740
Tone it down!

250
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
[Marsha] And now, the singing competition.

251
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,410
[singing incoherently]

252
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,910
[audience] Aw!

-Ugh!
-[buzzing]

256
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,970
Only three babies left.

257
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,470
Let's see what they're made of
in the dancing competition.

258
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,390
I was a triple threat back
in my sorority days. Dancing and math.

259

-Why are they doing this?

-[monitor beeping]
-[gasps]

263
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,240
It's backfiring. The crowd is turning.
We're losing baby love.

264
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,040
And another one bites the dust.

265
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,540
Uh... oh.

266
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,250
[cooing, giggling]

267
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,330
[whispering] You're next.

268
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,010
-Staci.
-[fingers cracking]

269
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,010
Hey, I'm standing right here.

270
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,180
-Sorry, didn't see ya.
-You're not exactly helping the cause.

271
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,850
The whole point of this pageant
is to make people love babies.

272
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,100
Sir, you told me

273
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,770
I had to find a way to win, so I did,
by making everyone else lose.

274
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,860
You're worse than Jarreau McIntosh!

275
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,150
I am a winner! [grunting]

276
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,120
Staci!

277
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,290
Plan B is a disaster. We need a plan C.

278
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,500
-Whoa!
-[crashes]

279
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,790
Uh... maybe we let plan B ride it out.

280
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,130
[blabbering]

281
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,590
Is this a good idea?

282
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,800
If he can stand up to my jack-in-the-box,
he can conquer his fears.

283
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,850
Then he'll be all better
and give us the crown, right?

284

-[giggling]
-[music playing]

285
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:06,610
Easy. Don't get scared all over again.
[screaming]

286
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,690
[giggling]

287
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,190
He's not scared anymore.
Let's get that crown.

288
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,030
What now?

289
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,410
-[music playing]
-[giggling, blabbering]

290
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,870
I don't wanna say
this is what he just said, but...

291
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,170
it's possible the story was fake
and he just wanted a free jack-in-the-box.

292
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,590
[groans] Jarreau McIntosh, that is it!

293
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,590
Hold him down, Jimbo!
We are taking that crown!

294
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,430
It's not his fault!
He was a simple drummer!

295
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,020
He was unprepared
for this go-go celebrity lifestyle!

296
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,940
I was a baby when I won,
and I handled it fine. Look.

297
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,770
I'll show you
what a winner's supposed to be like.

298
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,650
Mom and Dad must've taken tons
of photos of my victory tour.

299
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,200
All the ceremonies and ribbon-cuttings.

300
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,660
-Hang on, I'll be right back.
-[dishes clattering]

301
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,750
-Hey, Timbo.
-Your baby brother still down for his nap?

302
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,130
Sure. Anyway, for no reason,
I was looking at my photo albums.

303
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,260
I can't find any pictures of when I won

304
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,470
-the Little Dumpling Pageant.
-Oh, Timmy,

305
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,260
I'm surprised you even remember us
telling you that.

306
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,510
-Total lie, by the way.
-What?

307
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,270
Oh, yeah. You never even made it out
of the first round.

308
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,480
-You were so excited.
-[baby burps]

309
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,360
You kept gulping down bottle
after bottle after bottle.

310
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,940
And when you toddled out on that stage...

311
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,280
-it all came back up.
-[stomach rumbling]

312
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,280
-[Tim vomiting]
-[all gasp]

313
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,950
They called you "Spit-uppleton."

314
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,950
[both laugh]

315
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,460
Oh, pretty funny name. But also, cruel.

316
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,340
-Pageant parents are monsters.
-We didn't want it to scar you,

317
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,880
so we called you
our own champion Little Dumpling.

318
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,050
-Even made you a tiny toilet paper crown.
-Why would you do that?

319
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,850
-I've been living a lie!
-Sorry, Tim. I guess we're your parents.

320
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,230
No matter what happens,

321
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,900
we want you to feel like a winner
because you are a winner.

322
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,070
[chuckles] I mean, not in the pageant,
obviously. [mimics vomiting]

323
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:18,030
[laughs] Just more of being
the best Tim Templeton in the whole world.

324
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,990
-I gotta go.
-My spoon!

325

-[music playing]
-[giggling]

326
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,290
Jarreau,
I've learned in the last few minutes

327
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,870
that the crown doesn't mean anything.

328
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,580
What matters is what makes you
feel like a winner. So...

329
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,710
what makes Jarreau McIntosh
feel like a winner?

330
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,420
[blabbers]

-[giggling]

332
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,350
What do you say?

333
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,140
-Ready to pass on that crown?
-[coos]

334
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,600
-[laughs]
-Take care of Jarreau.

335
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,480
-I'll run the crown back.
-[Marsha] It's the final finger paint-off!

336
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,990
Can you feel the excitement
and lack of actual artistic talent, folks?

337
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,160
-We got the crown. How's it going?
-Staci's winning,

338
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
but she's gone full McIntosh!

339
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,830
[Boss Baby gasps] She's got glue!

340
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,080
Don't do it, Staci.

341
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,460
Staci, freeze!
I know you can hear me, Staci.

342
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,840
I learned several minutes ago
the crown doesn't mean anything.

343
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,640
What matters is what makes you
feel like a winner.

344
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,810
-Good speech.
-I practiced.

345
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,150
She sure is a little something.

346
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,150
[cooing]

347
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,860
[whimpering]

348
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,120
-[all gasp, groan]
-[man] Oh, wow.

349
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,000
-[buzzing]
-[chuckling]

350
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,460
[man] This pageant is the worst!

351
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,840
I can't be expected to reward this, right?
Judges?

352
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,800
-[man] Nah.
-Right on. Well, I think we can all agree,

353
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,340
if there's one thing we've learned
from this pageant,

354
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,220
it's that babies are disgusting, clumsy,
mucus-filled disasters.

355
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,430
But I guess this girl in the tutu
is somehow the least disgusting.

356
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,940
Probably. Whatever.

357
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,860
So, by default,
your Little Dumpling winner is...

358
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,610
Uh... Jimbo... Jimbosdad!

359
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,990
[audience murmuring]

360
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,870
Okay, then.
Do we have a crown for this kid?

361
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,870
No, no, no, no, no! [gasps]

362
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,460
[crying]

363
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,720
-No.
-Don't make it worse, Staci.

364
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,550
[crying continues]

365
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,430
Honey, call the police.

366
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,180
[audience applauding] Aw!

367
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,230
[giggles]

368
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,520

[babies giggling, cooing]

370
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,410
The stuff I said worked!
I'm a real winner! Finally!

371
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

372
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,040
Brilliant, Staci!
I've never felt so much baby love.

373
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,460
This couldn't get any better.

374
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,510
[rock music playing]

375
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:37,730
It's Jarreau McIntosh! [screams, laughs]

376
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,860
Why did we ever make babies compete
against each other?

377
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,820
We're awful! This pageant is awful!

378
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,610
By the power vested in me
as a celebrity with a microphone,

379
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,530
I hereby declare this pageant
canceled forever.

380
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,710
All babies are winners.
Or, at least, most. Some.

381
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,130
Jimbo, you've proven that you can
never be left unsupervised.

382
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,800
-Yay! I will always have a friend.
-Templeton, on the other hand,

383
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,090
-way to drive it home.
-[chuckles]

384
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,680
I'm sorry, did I hear you say,
"Tim saved the day"?

385
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,930
Well, Tim and whatever brought on
your emotional 180.

386
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,190
Honestly, Staci, I've never seen you
display so much heart. Or any.

387
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,390
Pssh!

388
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,520
What heart? I told you I wanted
the pageant shut down, and I shut it down.

389
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,820
Don't... ever... cross... me!

390
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,490
Next year, bare-knuckle baby free-for-all!

391
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,660
Ring the bell, Brayden!

392
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,290
-I'm just glad she's on our side.
-I'm still scared.
