-I need ideas. You!
-Ah! We see a baby with a fuzzy tail.

Ah! Nightmare fuel!
You're off the team.

-Oh!
-You?

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,330
Imagine a baby on a potty chair
that's made of flowers!

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,420
Gross! Strangely beautiful,
but mostly gross.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,750
-You're off the team.
-But--

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,170
[groans] I'm surrounded by amateurs.

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,670
I could get better ideas
from some mail department intern.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,220
You, mail baby. Poster idea.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,720
-Go!
-Me?

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,220

I'm digging what you're dumping, kid.
What's your name?

30
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,950
Mega Fat Mail Room Intern Baby.

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,120
How'd you like to be my Mega Fat intern

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,160
in the posters and greeting cards
department?

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,160
Oh, my goodness!

34
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,710
I get to work with Boss Baby,
the fastest-rising star in Baby Corp?

35
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,920
Oh, you better believe it.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,050
Now get those snot rocks
out of your schnoz,

37
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,550
buy a fresh pair of booties.

38
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,550
Before every move,
ask yourself one question:

39
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,050
how will this increase baby love?

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,470
[gasps] You are so business savvy.
Are we going to be best friends?

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
[chuckles]

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,100
Well, I don't like
to make market predictions,

43
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,730
but a smart guy like you filled with
advice like mine,

44
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,610
well, I'd say stock
in You and Me Incorporated

45
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,820
is going nowhere but up, up, up!

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,900
-[singing]
-Will you listen to me?!

47
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,240
This is urgent,
you noise-making dumpling.

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,290
-We have to act on this!
-[gasps] You broke my noise machine.

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,080
I am not cheap to repair!

50
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,040
Will you please just listen?

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,170
I've got a lead
on Bootsy Calico's master plan.

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,970
"Six well-placed kittens."

53
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,510
What does it mean? I figure Bootsy
has been planting kittens all around town.

54
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,560
Mr. Pineapple,
that one he gave to the Mayor,

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,980
Cat Cop, probably one of the copycats.
That's four. Who are the other two?

56
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,900
We have suspects,
but we need resources to find them.

57
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,070
This is a five-alarm,
all-hands-on-deck situation.

58
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,400
Oof McGoof.

59
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,200
It seems the teacher has become
the flunky, F-minus loser student.

60
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,490
Have you forgotten
the first lesson you ever taught me?

61
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,120
"How will this increase baby love?"

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,790
Bootsy Calico is a madman.
The whole town is in jeopardy.

63
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,630
-This is bigger than baby love.
-Oh, what? Now you talkin' crazy.

64
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,800
Waste my time on your own time.
I'm shutting you diddy-diddy-down.

65
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,010
-[imitates powering down noise]
-But...

66
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,350
-Did you just call me a butt?
-What?

67
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,850
A butt? No.

68
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,980
One could interpret him
as having called you a butt.

69
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,020
-What?
-Really, Boss Baby, a butt?

70
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,440
-That's the very best you can do?
-Oh, I can do much better.

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,950
Oh, you are not sassing me.
Are we doing this?

72
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,700
I think you are sassing me,
and we are doing this.

73
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,410
Okay. Fine. Magnus, it's time.
Hit that big red button.

74
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,000
The button on this drawing you made me
carry around for months has been hit.

75
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,960
[whistles]

76
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,550
Kaboom! Let's go nuclear, Boss Baby.

77
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,340
I've got hush-hush secret dirt on you,
naughty boy.

78
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,010
And tomorrow morning,
I'm taking it to the board of directors.

79
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,850
Secret dirt on me? You're bluffing.
You would've used it already.

80
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,020
Oh, well, then I guess you have nothing
to worry about,

81
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,400
until tomorrow, when I end your career.
Oh, I flipped it. Bye-bye-byesies.

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,490
It's cool. I'm good.

83
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,490
This is not cool. I am cooked!

84
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,370
What does he have on you?
Nothing, right? You're the best.

85
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,660
Yeah, nothing. No need to panic.

86
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,170
[screams]

87
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,050
Is there some secret you don't remember?
Like a booger ball you've been hiding

88
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,470
in your dresser drawer for...
no reason or something?

89
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,760
When Mega Fat worked for me,
I gave him plenty of secrets.

90
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,930
But we were friends.
They were all good secrets.

91
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,690
Secret: put a blankie under your desk,

92
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,940
and no one will ever know
you're power napping.

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,060
Oh, hoo, hoo!

94
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,480
Secret: want stronger coffee?
Add seven or eight extra scoops

95
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,900
when Office Manager Baby Barb
isn't looking.

96
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,660
[slurps] Oh, whoo!

97
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,620
Giddy-up, baby! Yeehaw! What!

98
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,660
Secret: learn to change
your own diaper one-handed

99
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,790
and you'll never have to interrupt
another call.

100
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,040
Ooh. Ooh!

101
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,460
Ooh!

102
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,050
[baby] Did you just change your diaper
on the phone with me?

103
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,170
No.

104
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,890
[both laughing]

105
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,350
And then, one day, he betrayed me.

106
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,100
Well, what happened?

107
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,390
-[monitor chiming]
-Hold that thought. Any luck, Frankie?

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,400
Dead end. No idea where Mega Fat
would keep secret evidence.

109
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,520
Ah, I knew it was a long shot. Thanks.

110
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,360
I mean, there's that secret vault
in his office behind the bookcase.

111
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,820
The one he keeps putting things into
and laughing all evil like... [laughs]

112
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,200
But that's too obvious, right?

113
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,910
Secret vault behind the bookcase?
Outstanding work, Frankie.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,580
Sorry I can't help. Bye.

115
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,790
All right, Templeton.

116
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,080
-We need to stop Bootsy, right?
-Absolutely.

117
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,540
But if Mega Fat's secret dirt
gets me fired,

118
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,880
we lose access to all of Baby Corp's
resources...

119
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,840
-And then we can't stop Bootsy.
-Oh, you're a natural, kid.

120
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,260
So tonight, while Mom and Dad sleep,

121
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,140
we are going to break in
and rob Mega Fat's vault.

122
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,560
Whoa, I thought we were the good guys.

123
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,810
Breaking in, robbing,
sneaking out of the house after dark,

124
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,770
that's bad guy stuff. Hey!

125
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,610
Ah, the latest issue
of Centipedeor: Unleashed.

126
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,690
I didn't read this one yet.
Tell me, Templeton, what happened

127
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,950
after the villainous Dark Swatter
completed his mega Earth zapper?

128
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,660
Well, first, Centipedeor stole
the Army's secret LaserChopper.

129
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,540
[laughing]

130
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,040
Tally-ho to the chase, Ladybug Lad.

131
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,670
You'd think a hero named after
a hundred-legged bug

132
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,880
wouldn't need a helicopter
to catch a villain on foot,

133
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,460
but, sure, I'll suspend disbelief.

134
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,590
[Dark Swatter] Is that all you've "swat"?
[laughs]

135
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,180
I'll get you, Dark Swatter,
no matter the cost.

136
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,010
Well, I calculate over two million dollars
in property damage.

137
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,640
[Dark Swatter laughing]

138
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
-[trigger beeps]
-[Dark Swatter screams]

139
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,350
Oh, well, make that 80 million.

140
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:07,320
I do what I gotta do to save the planet.
I am Centipedeor Unleashed.

141
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,740
Then I assume the police come arrest you
for destroying half the city?

142
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,280
What? No.

143
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,990
Centipedeor gets a medal
from the president.

144
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,870
He only destroyed the city
to save the world.

145
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,750
Oh.

146
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,080
Don't you see?

147
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,170
You can do whatever you want
so long as it's for the greater good.

148
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,840
Break into vaults, smash stuff,
stay out all night without permission.

149
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,130
I never get to stay out all night
or smash stuff.

150
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,760
But if it's for the greater good...

151
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,310
We have to do bad stuff to save your job

152
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,430
so we can save the town
from Bootsy Calico.

153
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,350
Yes! Welcome to the magical world
of gray area rationalization.

Welcome to Tim Templeton... Unleashed.

155
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,030
Noble scoundrel, first things first:
if we're staying out all night,

156
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,160
we need to make sure Mom and Dad
don't wake up and find us gone.

-Nothing!

Gwendolyn's a good kitty.
So soft and friendly.

How is that a secret?
I see that poster everywhere.

349
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,520
I-- I know what this is.
A reminder of the day he betrayed me.

350
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,810
Finally!

-Hey!

-Oh, no biggie. Just crushing it.

356
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,750
A cat poster?
How will this increase baby love?

357
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,290
It neutralizes the enemy.

358
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,590
[chuckles] Who would want a cat
when they see how silly they are?

359
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,260
Not our concern. It should be a baby.

-Presentation time?
-Uh, no, buddy. You stay put.

-We are, but I'm still the boss.

that couldn't get any worse?

I'm sorry, but we feel this poster
makes babies look foolish.

366
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,950
This may actually decrease baby love.

367

-Uh, that was the intern's idea.
-[gasps]

368
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,750
My idea was, we make cats look foolish.
You know, neutralize the enemy.

369
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,170
Good idea.

-Very nice.

Great job.

Hmm. [growls]

375
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,720
The poster was huge.

376
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,520
It made a significant dent in cat love,
turning cats into a joke for millions.

377
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
You took all the credit. You betrayed him.

378
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:56,030
[gasps] You're not Ladybug Lad.
You're Dark Swatter. You're the bad guy.

Yeah, wow, I really remembered that wrong.

I guess we all make mistakes.

I should've known this was a trap.

382

Sorry not sorry for this goose chase.

383
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,920
I wanted you to remember the betrayal
that inspired me to rise

384
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,380
to the tippy tippy top,
just so I could crush you.

385
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,550
It feels so good.
Phil, seize their chupies.

but we were besties once.

than stopping Bootsy Calico.
