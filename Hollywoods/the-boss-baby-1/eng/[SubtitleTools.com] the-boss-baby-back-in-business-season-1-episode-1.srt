what do I do here at Baby Corp?

makes the babies.

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,560
Triplets, I need a diversion.
Something special from the R&amp;D department.

173
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,400
-We're helpful!
-[Triplets cheer]

174
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,740

[mother] What is it, hon?

178
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,250
It says we won a free baby swing.

179
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,550
Ooh, latest model from Japan!

180
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,630
[mother] Japan?

181
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,010
-Super-advanced technology.
-Fancy!

182
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,100
Huh. No assembly instructions.

183
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,260
-[Jimbo grunts]
-Nice work, Jimbo.

184
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,140
Staci, arrange a meeting.

185
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,820
Scooter, why are we having
this conversation?

186
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,950
[belches]

188
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,660
Your job is a no-brainer.

give you food and shelter.

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,500
-You doosie, they doosie.
-[Scooter screams]

191
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,250
How do we move the needle on this one?
Talk to me.

-[speaks gibberish]
-[all gasp]

193
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,800
-What did he say?
-Uh...

194
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,840
Assorted things about our mother.
Better you don't know.

195
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,890
-[Scooter yelling]
-He's a total loss.

196

take him back to Baby Corp.

197
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,850
Take him away? You can't.
I thought we were supposed to help him.

198
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,190
Staci, I like the problem-solving
and lack of morals, but the kid's right.

199
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,700
We don't need drastic measures.
What have I been teaching you, Templeton?

200
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,280
That I owe you a favor? I lost interest
after you promised me cookies.

201
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,290
It's all business. We just need
to find out what Scooter Buskie wants.

202
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,330
Buskie, let's do some business.

It's like negotiating with North Korea!

This is my job on the line.
Somebody help me out!

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,380
No hugs, Jimbo!

221
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,470
-You want me to...?
-I do, but think of the lawsuits.

222
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,180
Maybe not everything's about business.

223
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,470
You shut your lying mouth!

224
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,060
If a baby's fussy,
something's probably bothering him.

225
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,310
What's wrong, widdle grump-grump?
Tummy gurgles? Izzums sweepy?

00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,520
Doodles in the didee?

227
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,650
Baby talk is hate speech, Templeton.

228
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,610
-I got it!
-What?

229
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,820
See that bump on his gums?
He's getting his first tooth.

230
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,910
-No wonder poor baby is so cranky.
-Staci, what do we have for tooth pain?

231
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,920
Frozen pacifier. Numbs the gums.

232
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,170
All better, Scooter?

233
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,050
I can't believe that worked.

234
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,180
I brought you to work because I thought
I could teach you something.

235
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,970
But I was wrong.
You're the one who's teaching me--

236
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,640
-Fart! Poop! Doody! [shouts]
-[Scooter growling]

237
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,940
Scooter, no!

238
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,900
That single tooth.
It's like Lucifer's javelin!

239
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,270

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,780
Cool. Now we've added biting.

243
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,360
Good effort, Templeton.

244
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,160
But when you took away Scooter's pain,
all you did was unleash a greater evil.

-[beeping]
-Sir, the baby-hate is spreading.

246

There's a young couple next door
that might actually get a... a cat!

247
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,500
A cat instead of a baby?

248
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
-[groans]
-Are we gonna get fired?

249
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,550
No, we are gonna fix this kid.
I've got one last desperate idea.

250
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,350
Templeton, I'm calling in
that favor you owe me.

251
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,600
What do you need?

252
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,890
Gold star stickers.
Go home, grab as many as you can.

253
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,020
-Meet me at Baby Corp.
-On it!

254
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,030
-Are you and your brother having fun?
-Nothing suspicious! I love you. Bye!

255
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Got 'em!

256
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,490
Outstanding.

257
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,450
One for Staci. Take one for yourself,
Timmy. You've earned it.

258
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,540
But what happened
to "one last desperate idea"?

259
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,040
I'll be honest, Templeton. I decided
to go with Staci's factory recall plan.

260
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,550
You were against it. Figured I'd save us
an awkward family argument.

261
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,090
So gold star for me, too. Good job.

262
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,010
What did you do with Scooter?

263
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,850
We brought him in for retraining.

Of course not.

Every four hours, every day,
she has to feed that... that...

Oh, the routine is the same.

what precious wonder awaits?

What? You are in so much trouble.

290
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,050
Jimbo's just a fill-in.

291
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,470
We'll issue the Buskies a factory-fresh
baby as soon as one's available.

292

You're not done here after all, Templeton.

I'll take Staci and deal
with the Jimbo situation.

345
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,730
That one's on you.

346
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,650
Um, is there like a security guard or...?

Hi, boss's brother.

351
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,240
Call when you've got him contained.
Don't get me fired!

352
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,750
I'm a security!

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,050
So is the giant muscle-baby working
with the killer robot swing, or...

356
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,180
Who cares?
Get in there and find my little boy!

357
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,470
What did you do?

358
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,060
Whaaa...?!

359
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,310
-Scooter! Hey, Scoo--
-[Scooter shrieks]

360
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,650
Be a good baby! No!

361

[Tim] No! Scooter!

362
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,780
-No! Be a good baby--

-[alarm dings]

364
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,410
-Templeton!
-Hey! Everything's under control here.

365
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,370
You're an atrocious liar.
That's not what I'm calling about.

366
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,250
The Buskie house is surrounded! Had to
send out the baby swing as a distraction.

367
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,880
-It's got my gun!
-Turbo! Turbo!

368

[Boss Baby] Scan the board
and find us an escape route.

369
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,840
Tick-tock, Templeton.
The situation is at crisis levels here.

370
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,430
Staci, how's the neighborhood?

371
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,220
People are really hating babies, sir.

372
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,760
-Okay, I have an idea.
-And I have a crisis.

373
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,730
Winner, me. Where's my escape route?

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,270
[Tim] Oh, Scooter!

375
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,650
I found more cookies and juice boxes.

376
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,730
Templeton!

377
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,570
Templeton, where are you?
I've lost contact.

378
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,280
Block the door. We get busted,
that's a two-year stretch in daycare.

379
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,740
No! They can't send me back to daycare.

380
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,000
[screams] I will go out
in a storm of blood and fire!

381
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,210
-[Tim] Hey.
-Oh, thank goodness.

382
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,460
Exit route, Templeton. ASAP!

383
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,800
Or... since I got Scooter,
I can just send him back to his parents.

384
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,710
What?

385
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,380
This situation's a powderkeg,
that baby is the blowtorch.

386
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,100
Send him out now, no one in
this neighborhood will love babies again!

387
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,510
I absolutely forbid-- Wait.

It was right on the map.

406
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,870
The whole neighborhood
hates Scooter Buskie, right?

407
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,830
But not at his house.

408
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,590
So I figured, you want
to make everyone love babies?

409
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,340
Maybe they just had to see Scooter
the way his mom and dad do.

410
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,890
Not business. Family.

411
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,390
Sir, baby love is off the charts!

My cousin has wandering baby syndrome.

It's a real thing that's probably
in the encyclopedia probably.

Don't check that. I love you. Bye!

So, uh, do I owe you now?
This is making me uncomfortable.

But you do know family.
That makes us a real synergy powerhouse.

So maybe if you want,
we could work together again tomorrow?

Sounds fun.
But this time it's gonna cost you.
