00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,040
I'm not paying
for some fancy store-bought juicer!

169
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,210
[grunts]

170
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,090
Give it! You are not...
[grunts] ...working today.

171
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,390
Hard work... [grunts] ...fixes...

172
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,930
[grunts] ...everything.

173
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,890
-You okay there, BB?
-My baby brother is taking a sick day

174
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,690
because he is...

175
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,320
-[beeps]
-[over PA] ...constipated!

176
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,690
[all gasping]

177
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,450
-Wha-a-a...
-Oh, no.

178
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,950
...a-a-a-a-a...

179
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,620
-...a-a-a-a-at?
-[grunts]

180
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,290
Mega Fat CEO Baby.

181
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,380
Did something clog your schnitzel chute?
That's terrible-arious.

182
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,050
Mega Fat CEO Baby's sympathy
is tainted with amusement.

183
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,680
It's not a problem. [grunts] My team
can still take care of these copycats.

184
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,980
Party, party, celebration.
Love that good news.

185
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,190
Of course, your field team will have
to stop the copycats without you

186
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,860
because you're taking a si-si-si-sick day.

187
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,030
I just need... [grunts] ...to work.

188
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,700
Oh, oh, oh, no. No work
until you get the poo-poos out.

189
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,420
-Hmm?
-If I catch you working, you're fired.

190
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,750
If your team fails without you,
you're also fired.

191
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,170
-What?
-Call it a catch number two.

192
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,470
Have fun at home with your man-baby,
whatever his name is. I want to say Cody.

193
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,140
-It's actually--
-Your name is now Cody.

194
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,730
All right. Ooh!
Templeton, pace me back and forth.

195
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,770
-Why?
-Because it's dramatic and you owe me.

196
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,190
All right, these copycats are out there.

197
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,360
They're moving, and they're damaging
our business more and more

198
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,280
with every phony baby cry.

199
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,700
How are we supposed to catch them all,
sir, even with the substitutes?

200
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,370
-We're temporary!
-Turn me, hands on hips.

201
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,920
You don't catch them all.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,750
You catch one copycat

203
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,840
and make it lead you to the ringleader,
Bootsy Calico.

204
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,590
Stop him, you stop them.

205
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,260
-Brilliant!
-Can't lose!

206
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,390
I'll join you as soon as I can, uh...
offshore my personal assets.

207
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,310
Thank you for that disgusting
illustration, Templeton.

208
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,520
-You're welcome.
-[Mom] Tim, is the baby upstairs?

209
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,110
[Dad] We got the juice
that'll make your stool loose.

210
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,570
-Juice?
-No juice, Jimbo.

211
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,030
-Just go, go, go! Oh!
-[stomach grumbling]

212
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,370
-[mimics baby crying]
-[man groans] Babies!

213
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,450
Snatch and grab. We move stealthy
and silent, like the cold hand of death.

214
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,830
-What if I need to be loud?
-Don't.

215
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,090
-What if there's a ghost?
-Ghosts are spooky.

216
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,300
-You have to scream.
-Cat got away.

217
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,630
Darn it!

218
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,300
[burps]

219
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,220
I don't think the prune juice is working.

220
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,140
Try to make him do this,
therapeutic swaying.

221
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,350
It's a rock crusher for bowel blockages.
I do this before every movement.

222
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,860
-I feel weird when you call it a movement.
-It's a perfectly scientific word.

223
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,490
-Parents make movements too, Timmy.
-Mom!

224
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,240
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
I can really feel it dancing.

225
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,750
-Can I try to help the baby?
-You really want to?

226
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,380
You said he's stressed,

227
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,550
and it just so happens
his big brother is an expert relaxer.

228
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,550
-He can hang out with me.
-[giggling]

229
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,260
-[whispering] Game shows.
-[continues giggling]

230
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,970
Aw! Honey, that's so sweet!

231
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,010
Couldn't hurt.

232
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,350
[giggling]

233
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,140
I need to go make a movement now, anyway.

234
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,060
-[groans]
-[cat mimics baby crying]

235
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,860
[woman] Come on!
Put a pacifier in that thing already!

236
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,610
[purring]

237
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,790

[copycat squeaks]

239
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,620
Yay! I got the copykitty.

240
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,290
[Staci] Get off of me, Jimbo!

241
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,130
[gasps] It knows how to copy Staci.
[grunts]

242
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,300
I am the mighty hunter! [howling]

-[howling]
-Boo!

244
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,770
Okay, we've got cereal...
and look at all the game show options.

245
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,520
Stump the Chimp,
The Two-Dollar Double Date.

246
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,560
Ooh! Name Those Noises!

247
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,860
I find none of this enjoyable.
I should be out there with my team.

248
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,490
Well, you can't, okay?

249
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,780
Your CEO boss said you can't work
until you poop, or you get fired.

250
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm a corner office baby. I should be able
to fill my diaper in two seconds flat.

251
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,960
This is mail room intern behavior.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

252
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,750
Look, I didn't wanna tell you this
because you're already stressed,

253
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,800
but when sick days don't fix things,
Mom and Dad have to try something...

254
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,260
worse.

255
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,760
Is worse faster? Because if so--

-[stomach grumbling]
-[screaming]

257
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,220
He's still hurting that bad?

258
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,850
Tim, this was so sweet of you to try,
but I think it's time.

259
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,770
No!

260
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,940
We need to take him to...
the pediatrician.

261
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,860
You mean Dr. Kevin?

262
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,450
-Yes, Dr. Kevin.

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,720
No more wah-wah!

270
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,680
It's bad cop/good cop, Jimbo.
We can't both be the bad cop.

271
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,980
-Where's Bootsy Calico?
-Who do you work for?

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,610
-How long have you been a cat?
-Stop it!

273
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,820
There's just one bad cop, and it's me!

Who put you in charge?

[yelling] Who put you in charge?

276
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,160
We're interrogating the cat, not me!

277
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,280
I got confused!

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,790
Jimbo, stop petting the cat!

280
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,870
I was being good cop.

-[moans]
-What's happening?

282
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,130
-What's wrong with Dr. Kevin?
-What's wrong with Dr. Kevin? Shots!

283
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,550
[gasps] He wouldn't.

284
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,970
Medicine that tastes
like a cherry barfed until it died.

285
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,220
-Not in my mouth.
-Your mouth if you're lucky.

286
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,020
-No!
-And he doesn't even give stickers.

287
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,850
Where's the quid pro quo?

288
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,520
-You do not want to go to Dr. Kevin.
-I really don't.

289
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,110
Then forget relaxing.
You need to fill that diaper right now.

290
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,740
Agreed, but how?

291
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,660
Whatever it takes.

292
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,330

At least I'm trying. You keep complaining
about not being at your stupid work.

301
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,100
And why does that copycat sound like
it's crying in our basement?

302
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,520
-I'll go. [groaning]
-You focus on pooping.

Hey! What's going on?
And why are you in our basement?

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,250
I haven't cleaned mine up
from the last interrogation.

310
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,290
What interrogation? You caught a copycat?

311
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,750

so my brother could relax
and get unconstipated.

Oh, you're so perfect.

Why don't you tell us
your copycat plan, huh?

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,400
What? Uh, no. My job was...

I don't have a--
I don't like being in charge.

-[Mom] Stop praising him! No!

let's agree that all decent real Americans

-[Boss Baby] What?

341

-[Mom] You don't speak for me!
-[senator babbles]

342
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,600
[man] There's no call
for that kind of language, Senator.

343
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,230
[man 2] Toasted buns?
Pure moral degeneracy.

344
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,730
[Mom] I'll toast your buns,
you shallow puddle

-of toxic rain sludge! [grunts]
-[man] Thank you, Senator.

346
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,240
We'll now take some calls.
Hello, you're on...

Templeton, what?

349
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,170
We've got five minutes
before Mom reaches Dr. Kevin's office.

350
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,460
And probably ten before she stops yelling
at talk radio and realizes you're gone.

351
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,380
I appreciate the temporary reprieve,
but... [grunting]

352
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,590

354

We're still in the same constipation
situation. Tell me you have a plan.

355
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,520
No, I do not. And your team
is a disaster without you.

356
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,350
Sir, for the record, I was very good.

357
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,520
You can put that in your report.
"Very good. Staci.

358
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,570
A gold star of excellence, really."

how this is helpful.

360

I don't like being in charge, but you do.
Being the boss makes you happy.

361
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,120
And being happy relaxes you.
And if you're relaxed...
