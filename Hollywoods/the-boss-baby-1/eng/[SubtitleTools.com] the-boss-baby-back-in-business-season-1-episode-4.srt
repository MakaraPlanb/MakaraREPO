Teddy bears! You want one, I want one.

I want one! I want one!

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,030
But what if you also want a soft,
cuddly elephant?

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,790
-I do. I want both!
-Enter the Inter-Custo-Plushie 1-9-B,

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,290
all the animals that tickle a baby's fancy
in one body.

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,630
Sure, a teddy bear makes babies happy,

18
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,630
but the ICP 1-9-B will make babies
do that face

19
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,550
where they look so excited,
they can't breathe. [coos]

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,140
That's the face we're aiming for, people.

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,890
Maximize baby cuteness,
you maximize baby love.

22
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,680
We're running a full field test
of every plushy combo.

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,980
Staci, octo-bear with antlers.
Jimbo, elephant-faced panda seal.

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,270
I love it. What is it?

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,270
Doesn't matter.
I'll try out rhino-moose-bear-- [snores]

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,110
Boss? Boss!

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,070
[grunts] Trickle-down economics!
Wait, what happened?

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,660
You fell a night-night.

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,700
-[gasps] On the job?
-No judgment, sir. Everybody naps.

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,750
Everybody naps at nap time,
not on the clock.

31
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,460
That's-- [snores]

32
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,630
[grunts, sucking]

33
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,170
-Can I stop making the face now?
-No!

34
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,170
[groans] Okay.

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,880
[snorts] Giraffes are a lie.

36
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,800
[gasps] Again? Something's wrong.

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,310
One nap, nobody's perfect, but two?
It's unnatural.

38
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,560
We need to get to the bottom of this.
Track down every possible source

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,060
of whatever's making me sleepy:

40
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,900
climate control problems,
gas leak from diaper disposal,

41
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,690
some sort of subliminal--

42
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,450
Eh? Oh... how long was I out?

43
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,950
I don't know, but things got worse.

44
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,410
-Worse?
-[drawls] Way worse.

45
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,540
-Agh!
-I know, right?

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,290
What happened to my voice?
Why am I talking like this? There's more.

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,430
Jimbo, did you eat a second,
smaller Jimbo?

48
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,550
-[grunts] My diaper pinches.
-So it's not just me.

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,310
Something and/or someone did this to us.
But why? And/or who?

50
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,690
Bootsy Calico?

51
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,520
But there's no kitten angle.
And we've been here the whole time.

52
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,480
Bootsy's got no access to Baby Corp.

53
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,740
No. We have to think outside the box.

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,870
Big ideas! No theory too wild!

55
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,120
Let's do this!

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,870
-Why am I holding a crayon?
-You fell asleep for, like, two hours.

57
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,500
-What?
-But don't worry.

58
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,130
We still brainstormed
some pretty big ideas.

59
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,340
Two hours and you two made one drawing
of Bootsy Calico with a stinky head?

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,060
Actually, boss,
you drew the stinky lines, in your sleep.

61
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,230
We already ruled out Bootsy Calico.
I said, outside-the-box ideas.

62
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,560
[grunts] Where's the original thinking?

63
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,110
Sir, we work for a large corporation.
Look around you.

64
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,240
-There is no imagination.
-I don't buy it.

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,570
[loudly] Hey, what's everybody
wearing to work tomorrow?

66
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,120
[all] Professional business attire!

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,160
-[groans] Sassy-voice Staci is right.
-[Staci] Duh.

68
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,540
We need someone with more imagination.
And I know just the man.

69
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,630
[Tim] Bring it on, space creeps.

70
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:02,720
It'll take more than space garbage
to stop Dekker Moonboots, space detective!

71
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,220
-[thumping]
-Templeton!

72
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,850
We've got a mystery on our hands
at Baby Corp.

73
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,430
A mystery, you say? What kind?

74
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,480
The kind that needs
a special brand of crazy.

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,730
Dekker Moonboots crazy?

76
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,820
Let's talk supplies.

77
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,820
I'm gonna need a whole set
of those markers that smell like food.

78
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,780
-Done.
-And a spinny chair.

79
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,820
-We'll see what we can do.
-Animal crackers,

80
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,990
-no rhinos.
-They all taste the same.

81
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,750
Danny Petrosky said his uncle ate a rhino,
and his stomach exploded.

82
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,710
Danny is a liar and a moron.

83
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,130
We gonna argue about animal crackers,
or am I gonna solve a space mystery?

84
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,010
Fine! Unusual problems call
for unusual solutions,

85
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,340
and you are nothing if not-- [snoring]

86
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,720
-Whoa!
-Careful, sir!

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,550
-[gasps, yells]
-[Jimbo] Boss!

88
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,520
-[screams]
-[snorts, gasps]

89
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,770
Wait, that's your mystery?
Voice changing, getting bigger,

90
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,520
-needing extra naps?
-[snores] You have theories?

91
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,990
-Hit me, Moonboots.
-[sighs] There's no mystery.

92
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,070
-You're having a growth spurt.
-I'm not following.

93
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,780
It's what happens when you grow up.
Your body changes,

94
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,450
and the little factory inside goes,
"Toot-toot! Break time!"

95
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,000
-When did my body go union?
-You need extra naps because

96
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,130
-your body's working so hard at growing.
-Impossible.

97
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,050
Hmm. Are you having other symptoms?

98
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,840
Uh, little bit of baby acne on my tush.
Staci says I'm having mood swings,

99
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,470
but Staci can't see inside of me!
You don't know everything!

100
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,680
I want to be a dancer! [sobs]

101
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,060
-[gasps] I'm growing up.
-[sighs] You didn't need Dekker Moonboots,

102
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,360
but I will take those markers
that smell like food.

103
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,320
[sniffs]

104
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,240
Ooh, hot dog.

105
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,740
No, Templeton,
this is literally impossible.

106
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,620
All Baby Corp employees drink
a special formula.

107
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,240
Yeah, it's supposed
to keep us babies forever.

108
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,960
Something went wrong.
It wouldn't be just us aging.

109
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,830
-It'd be--
-[voices yelling]

110
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,540
-[baby] What's happening?
-...the whole office.

111
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,420
[staff wailing]

112
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,800
-Has my voice always sounded like this?
-Aah! My shoes stretching!

113
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,100
Why are my feet enlargening? [grunting]

114
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,550
-[crashes]
-[snores]

115
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,560
-We're really... growing up.
-[gasps]

116
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,940
-No, no, no, no, no! Make it stop!
-[Staci gasps]

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,980
How is this happening?

118
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,980
It's a mystery! Dekker Moonboots is back!
Whee!

119
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,240
Mega Fat CEO Baby demands your attention!

120
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,160
Make the opening small talk
"blah-blah" for me.

121
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,870
Imagine this announcement has started
with a humorous anecdote

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
and laugh appropriately!

123
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,750
[chuckling]

124
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,300
No, you love me the most, and you!
Hey there!

125
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,260
Okay, I understand some of you
are changing

126
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,220
and just acting like real grown-ups.

127
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,180
As CEO, let me assure you,
change is totally normal.

128
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,230
-Nature has a way of sorting things out.
-[chuckling] Thank goodness.

129
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,310
That's why I'm going to fire
everyone who's aging.

130
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,570
Let's say, by end of business today.
Why not?

131
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,320
-[staff yelling]
-[alarm blaring]

132
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,870
This is a baby corporation.
If you can't handle your baby formula,

133
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,250
you have no business here.
Again, normal, nature's way. Peace out.

134
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,210
-[baby] No!
-You are all expendable!

135
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,540
[group screaming]

136
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,210
I gotta go hide.

137
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,510
-Oh, curse my comically large feet!
-[screaming]

138
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,590
I'm terrified.

139
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,140
Stop that. Stop panicking!
You're making me emotional!

140
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,760
[snores, gasps]

141
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,390
Oh, my acne.

142
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,190
-Everyone, calm down!
-Oof!

143
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,270
We'll figure this out
before anyone gets fired.

144
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,980
-Whee!
-Moonboots, good call on the aging.

145
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,780
So, new mystery.
Wow us with that outside-the-box thinking.

146
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,200
What's wrong with the formula?
Bad batch? Past its expiration date?

147
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,290
Here's how I see it: a race of aliens
that age backwards, old folks to babies.

148
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,620
They're trying to change your formula
so they can be old forever.

149
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,790
Their company? Old Alien Baby Corp.

150
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,670
-It's on Mars.
-Uh, take one step back inside the box.

151
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,800
Or... Vent Babies.

152
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,180
"Vent Babies"?

153
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,350
They live in your air vents
and steal your formula.

154
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,230
[whispers]
They could be watching us right now.

155
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,150
Stop talking.
You said, "Steal our formula"?

156
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,860
Well, Old Alien Baby Corp was built
in the Martian year 74 billion--

157
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,400
This was no accident.
Someone's tampered with the formula!

158
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,570
OMG!

159
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,820
[gulps]

160
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,120
-I'm a growing boy!
-Hyuh!

161
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,420
[slurping, swishing]

162
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,130
[slurps, gargling]

163
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,590
Their methods are unorthodox,
but darn it, they get results.

164
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,170
[gargling]

165
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,470
[spits] The formula's been tainted.

166
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,060
-[spits] Super tainted.
-[deep voice] I concur.

167
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,430
Normal Baby Corp formula,
vanilla milkshake.

168
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,770
You separated them in your mouth?

169
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,440
Oh... yeah!

170
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,360
We get it!
You have a super cool deep voice now.

171
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,780
So someone did tamper with the formula.

172
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,240
The vanilla milkshake
must've thrown off the effect,

173
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,910
-causing rapid aging.
-Dekker Moonboots, you've done it again.

Wait... of course!

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,890
The one who jumps at any chance
to fire employees just to shake things up?

You don't think...?

182

No, sir. None that I know of.

You're unprofessional!

233

The baby in formula storage
said you tainted the formula.

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,280

235
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,410

Never heard of him.

If no one works in formula storage,
what was she even doing there?

-Where do you think you're going?

-Nobody asked for backstory.

I had great ideas already,

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,640

-into families or management.

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,400

-[Tim] You never got placed anywhere.
-[screams]

281
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,070
I had nowhere to go,
so I fled into the walls of Baby Corp.

282
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,070
And I've been here ever since.

283
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,950
-[security] Which way was this hideout?
-[Mega Fat CEO Baby] What am I, a map?

284
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Security's coming, Frankie.
You're still a formula thief.

285
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,380
I had to, so I could stay young
like a real executive.

286
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,960
Then I needed more and more once
I assembled my own team, just like yours.

287
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,630
Jeez! There's more than one

Oh, stop, you're so bad.

291
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,810
This is Stapler. He's a stapler,
but he thinks he's a real baby.

00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,310
Shh. Don't tell him.

-No. Stop indulging this.

-You're gonna cost us our jobs!
-Jeez. Mood swing.

No, I'm genuinely angry!

299
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,590
I'm sorry. I tried adding the vanilla
milkshake so no one would know.

300
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,300
But what was I supposed to do?
Let Stapler starve?

301
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,020
That's right, you need formula, Stapler,
because you're a baby.

302
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,470
[Mega Fat CEO Baby] Maybe the left?

303
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,730

-He's in a firing mood, Frankie.

306
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,450
-It's you or us. Frankly, it's you.
-But this is my life.

00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:00,160
I can be an asset to Baby Corp.
I have lots of great ideas.

308
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,120
[gasps] Maybe you'd like to hear them.

309
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,870
-Not really.
-Of course we do.

310
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,710
I solved your mystery.
This is what I want for payment.

311
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,420
Just listen to her ideas, okay?

312
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,300
[groans] Oh, fine.

313
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,010
I would love to hear your ideas.
But I reserve the right to fall asleep,

314
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,310
get moody and/or scratch my acned tushie.

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:28,310
Thank you, sir. This means...
[moans] ...so much!

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,450
And now I can't fall out of my shirt
at my desk. Thanks, Stapler!

317

Upside-down meetings!

318
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,950
Think how many more ideas we'll have
with extra blood rushing to our heads.

319
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,380
And now you have a million cookies
instead of one.

Turn it inside out
and you can use it again!

321
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,470
I always overhear CEO Baby
complaining about the budget.

322
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,890
Think of the quarterly savings. Thank you.

323
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,810
Those are the worst ideas I've ever heard,

There is zero place for you at Baby Corp.

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,700
You are so fired.

327
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,320
You can't. You said you wanted
outside-the-box ideas.

Well, Frankie's got lots.

-Templeton--
-No.

330
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,750
It's Moonboots, the guy who said it was
Vent Babies and nobody believed me.

331
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,670
But was I right?

332
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,300
Yeah, you also said it was
Old Alien Baby Corp from Mars.

And I stand by that.

do something outside the box?

Attention, creepy little Vent Baby,

I'm sorry, Tim,
there's nothing I can use there.

We are going to flush this system clean.

Thank you ever so much, Boss Baby.
But I don't know if I'm ready for this.
