it was to join this family

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,950
If I can't beat a teenage girl,
who am I anymore?

168
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,910
[grunts] I'm a little boss!
I'm a little boss!

169
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,250
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. [grunts, groans] Okay.

170
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,880
I'll go to Baby Corp
and get the files on Marisol myself.

171
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,470
-Want me to keep her distracted?
-I want you to find her weak spots.

172
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,840
Stay on her, chat her up,

173
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,510
do not leave her side
until you know everything about her.

174
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,730
-I can do that.
-[laughing] I'm gonna get you!

175
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,020
[laughs]

176
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,020
[chuckles]

177
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,480
[gasps]

178
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,490
[bubbling]

179
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,080
[giggling]

180
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,460
-[farts]
-[grunting]

181
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,340
[Boss Baby]
Here's what I've got on Marisol.

182
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,630
Second-generation Paraguayan-American,
strong work ethic.

183
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,010
Ton of younger siblings,

184
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,090
so she was born with babysitting
in her veins.

185
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,010
And did I mention her schedule?
Booked through the holidays.

186
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,470
She even printed magnets
with her face on them!

187
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,720
If she weren't the enemy,

188
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,690
I'd shake her hand and take her to lunch
to learn her secrets.

189
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,610
-Tell me more about the magnets.
-Your turn. What do ya got?

190
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,480
Lots of stuff.
Her hair smells like flowers,

191
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,360
but her hands smell like
that candle store at the mall.

192
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,990
Unusable. What else?

193
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,410
She also loves board games.
And I love board games.

194
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,290
Smells and games? I left you
alone with her for that long... [gasps]

195
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,670
No, you didn't!

196
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,460
-What?
-She got to you!

197
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,920
A crush on the babysitter! How cliché.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,930
-Ew, no! What? No, ew. I like her face.
-What?

199
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,640
You better figure out your loyalties,
brother.

200
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,220
Because I am ending this with
or without you.

201
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,810
Templeton's been turned.
He's a good man, but soft.

202
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,520
This is a night for hard souls, like you.

203
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,240
-Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Whoo!

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,200
Down with babysitters!
Let no Templeton stand in your way!

205
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Yeah!

206
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
[rapid footsteps]

207
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,960
-[whispering, indistinct]
-What's going on?

208
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,760
Nothing. Uh, the monotonous sound
of a dial tone soothes me.

209
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,170
-[mimics dial tone]
-[telephone rings]

210
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,270
Hello? No, Mrs. Templeton isn't here.
May I take a message?

211
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,150
You want to clarify the toppings
for what pizzas? Thirty pizzas?

212
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,940
With pepperoni and gummy bears?
[sighs] Cancel the order, please.

213
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,410
Well, some rascal just made
a very expensive pizza order,

214
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,410
charging it to your parents' account.

215
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,290
-Any idea who would do that, hmm?
-Your eyes are so brown.

216
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,830
[chuckles] Nice try, Tim.
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.

217
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,670
And I thought I put you to bed.

218
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,960
[cooing]

219
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,630
All right,
if you two troublemakers are having fun,

220
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,720
I suppose he can stay up
a little bit longer.

221
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,340
-[creaking]
-What was that?

222
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,260
Nothing, but I'll make sure it's nothing.
You stay here. Bye!

223
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,940
-What are you doing?
-Oh, no.

224
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,480
Did baby draw on the floor with lipstick?

225
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,400
Is Marisol gonna get fired
and never come back?

226
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,660
-Poor lover-boy man-baby.
-I have normal eyes and you know it!

227
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,410
[grunts]

228
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,080
-Tim, are you talking to someone?
-Just practicing my French.

229
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,210
Le fromage cottage,
babble, babble, babble.

230
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,250
-What you got there?
-Uh, this is for you?

231
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
It's okay. I have little brothers.

232
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,930
I know you guys are curious about makeup.
So, everything's cool up here?

233
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,510
-Ice cool.
-Okay!

234
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,480
I will end her!

235
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,600
[gasps, grunts]

236
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,400
No! [groans] Down! Put me down!

237
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,530
Do not ruin this for me.
And where's Jimbo?

238
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,900
There. I believe that's every breakable
in the house.

239
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,660
-Jimbo smash?
-Jimbo smash good.

240
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,910
[giggling]

241
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,830
-Call it off!
-Never! Traitor!

242
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,920
[Marisol] Tim!

243
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,710
Um...

244
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,630
Oh, no. You think I haven't seen
baby bowling before?

245
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,470
-I have six little brothers.
-Wait, no, I wasn't--

246
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,640
Ever going to try this ever, ever again?
What a good boy you are.

247
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,850
[chuckles]

248
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,850
-I really am.
-And you have been up long enough.

249
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,400
Too serious.

250
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,070
Too spacey.

251
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,990
-Dangerous.
-[Marisol humming]

252
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,530
Her voice is like the music
they play in grocery stores.

253
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,160
[humming]

254
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,580
You know you're not the only kid
she sits, right?

255
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,750
This is work.

256
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,460
I know. She's a professional.
That's what I like about her.

257
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,420
[gasps] A professional! You're right!
That's how we get her!

258
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,170
[ringing]

259
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,340
-Hello.
-[Staci] Well, look who I found.

260
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,770
Care to explain why my husband and I have
been waiting for you for the past hour?

261
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,390
-Is this the pizza place again?
-This is Sandy Burgess!

262
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,690
You're supposed to be
sitting my kids tonight,

263
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,610
but great to know
you're having a pizza party.

264
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,110
-No idea what you're talking about.
-[Jimbo giggles]

265
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,900
I spoke to your mom this morning.

266
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,410
She said she'd tell you.
Are you calling your mom a liar?

267
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,120
No! I was in a rush this morning.

268
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,580
-So you coming to watch my kids or what?
-I'm sitting the Templetons right now.

269
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,750
Yeah, I called you there, duh. Bring them
and call it a playdate, I don't care!

270
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,260
My husband and I are about to lose
our couples massage appointment,

271
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,640
and I have never felt less relaxed!

272
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,680
Yes, certainly! What's your address?
We'll be right over.

273
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,890
[chuckling]

274
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,390
Hey, guys!

275
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,690
Okay, so, we're going to go play
with the Burgess kids,

276
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,520
and everything's going to be great!

277
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,360
But I thought we'd spend the night
playing board games,

278
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,700
and I'd wear a cool hat.

279
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,450
Tim, I'm going to level with you,
'cause you're a big boy.

280
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,030
I like where this is going.

281
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,330
I double-booked.
I've never done this before.

282
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,370
My scheduling is so flawless
that on my free days,

283
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,460
I teach a class on time management
at the community college.

284
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,840
So, we have to go,
but I promise it will be fun. Please?

285
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,170
Okay. Let's go play
with that random family.

286
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:36,260
This just in: I don't eat cookies,
and I don't care about your summer camp.

287
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,640
-You're Marsha Krinkle from TV!
-Channel 8 News! Do you have a story?

288
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,690
-Talk. I'm always ready.
-Uh, no, no story.

289
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,020
I'm Marisol. Uh, is "Mrs. Burgess"
a secret name you use

290
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,690
-so fans don't know where you live?
-[microphone thuds]

291
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,820
I'm-- I'm here to watch your kids.

292
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,660
[chuckles] Honey, does this look like
the exhausted face of a mother?

293
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,660
Uh, I spoke with somebody on the phone.
Maybe your assistant?

294
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,040
-I have a strict no-refund policy.
-Hey! Where are you--? Get back here!

295
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,210
[yells]

296
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,960
[grunts]

297
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,380
[gasps]

298
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,930
Yeah!

299
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,640
-Why are you doing this?
-[gasps] I am a lost baby.

300
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,350
That's the end of your girlfriend's
babysitting career. Ha!

301
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,690
[growls, gasps]

302
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,730
[slow-motion screaming]

303
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,530
[grunts]

304
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,910
-[grunts]
-Ha!

305
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,830
-Better lay off the cookies, Timmy.
-[groans]

306
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,540
-[grunts, gasps]
-[Boss Baby] Peek-a-boo.

307
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,630
[Boss Baby giggles]

308
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,760
Ha-ha! [gasps]

309
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,840
-Gotcha!
-[groans] Curse these stubby little legs!

310
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,300
I can't believe you.

311
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,600
You embarrassed Marisol,
and in front of a celebrity.

312
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,640
-Local talent. Barely counts.
-Enough.

313
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,890
I'm taking you home. Wait. Where is home?

314
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,070
-All these houses look the same.
-[Boss Baby] How are we lost?

315
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,820
-You've lived here your whole life!
-Yeah, but never at night.

316
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,370
-[owl hooting]
-[both gasp]

317
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,280
What was that?

318
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,960
Uh, per our current situation,

319
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,750
I may have gone too far with the whole
getting rid of Marisol thing.

320
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,710
And in the event
we don't make it back safely--

321
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,550
-Do we live here now?
-I want you to know, um... I'm sorry.

322
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,090
-[dog barking]
-[gasps]

323
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,220
You should be sorry. Marisol's
the best babysitter I've ever had.

324
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,850
-Why did you have to mess that up?
-I don't like bossy authority figures.

325
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,190
-You are a boss.
-But not everywhere!

326
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,690
Mega Fat CEO Baby turned my office
into a porta-potty.

327
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,110
I'm losing respect over there.
Things feel different.

328
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,990
[sighs] You wouldn't understand.

329

and leave a teenager in charge?

Yeah, someone they trust to protect us.
Doesn't that just prove they love us?

I'd like to go on record as saying
I had nothing to do with this.

How can you do this?

343
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,020
After all the nice stuff you said
and the hugging. There was hugging!

344
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,310
To be fair, the command was given before
the hugging. Boy, was it executed nicely.

[Marisol] I'm so sorry you had
to see the house like this.

I was hoping to clean it up

No, see, after dinner,
I opened the window because it was hot

358
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,890
and I didn't want to run
the air conditioning.

359

But then, a giant bat flew into the house.

00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,520
I started blaring the radio
because I read they hate loud music.

361
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,490
I opened more windows so it could fly out,
but it just kept flying around the house,

knocking things off the walls,
so I chased it,

363
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,530
even threw things to scare it off,
to protect the children.

364
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,410

but in the end, I won.

Colorful story, sweetie,
but I don't think this is gonna work out.

367
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,550
I understand.
I'll get rid of this on my way out.
