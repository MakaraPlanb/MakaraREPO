Yes, but what happened to you?

If you're not doing your job,
you're not really the boss.

Thank you, sir.

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,510
See the baby? It is cute and huggable.
Everybody loves babies.

117
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,050
That's why we're number one.

118
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,680
But you see this puppy?
It just wants to be loved, too.

119
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,230
Does that make it the enemy? Yes.
And that is why we crushed Puppy Co.

-Yeah!
-Killing it, Staci.

121

This meeting is making me uncomfortable.

But at least puppies
were an enemy with honor.

See the kitten?

124
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,780

is so you'll let your guard down.

Why do we own that book?

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,680
All right, field team. We are now
in the information gathering business.

130
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,470
We need to know who Bootsy Calico is.

-I'm on it.
-Yes, boss.

134
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,770
I can ask Mom and Dad for help.

135
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,520
Do you really just let Mommy and Daddy
fix everything for you?

136
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,440
Yeah.

137
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,490
Gotta grow up some time.
Parents can't be there forever.

[Dad] Aw, poor little fella.

139
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,910
[Mom] He's like a cozy, shivering slipper.

No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

141
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,880
He was on our doorstep.
Must've gotten lost.

142
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,340
That's so weird.
A tag, but no address or owner?

143
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,920
-Just "Gaa-gaa"?
-Weird name for a cat.

144
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,800
[gasps] He's calling me out.
That name tag is written in baby.

145
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:41,190
-And? What is it? What's the cat's name?
-Bootsy Calico.

147
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,400
Okay. The vet says he can find a home
in a few weeks.

148
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,950
In the meantime, he thinks it's a great
idea for us to foster our lost kitty.

149
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,780
-[Boss Baby sputters]
-Oh, of course.

150
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,210
We'll call him Little Nugget,
and we promise we won't get too attached.

151
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,250
Hey, for no reason,
do you guys have that vet's address?

152
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,590
Why are we going to the vet?
Think I can get him

00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,970
-to foster that kitten somewhere else?
-Hmm? What?

154
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,970

157
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,480
Now, the only remaining question is,

158
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,400
why is this Bootsy Calico kitten
inside my house?

159
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,360
Answer: the classic
"cat's in the cradle" gambit.

160
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,190
Out with baby, in with kitty.

161
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,780
Little Bootsy's trying to replace me
in my own home.

162
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,700
[chuckles]
So you can't show up for work on time,

163
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,330
and you've got a kitty-kitty cat
taking your place at home?

164
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,170
You're not just not a boss.
You're not even a good baby.

165
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,250
[laughing]

166
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,170
So are you calling for help from a real
executive baby who hasn't gone soft?

167
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,680
Because I'm one of those.

168
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,470
No, I'm calling to set the table for how
breathtaking my victory will be later.

169
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,310
And to get the last word.

170
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,060
Jimbo.

171
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,060
-Last word!
-[Boss Baby groans]

172
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,360
Jimbo! You were supposed
to shut it off before--

173
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,190
-[clicks]
-No, no. It doesn't help now.

174
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,740
[sighs] Doesn't matter. The task is set.

175
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,200
Mano a gato with a worthy adversary.

176
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,420
This is where the baby proves
he's still a boss.

177
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,580
[lapping]

178
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,380
You think you can come here in my home,
steal my love?

179
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,800
No, no, no, no. Not on my watch, kitty.

180
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,260
You're not kicking me out.
I'm kicking you out. Winner take all.

181
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,390
Whichever one of us steps out
of this house first, stays out. For good.

182
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
[Tim] What?

183
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,690
That is an insane contest!
Why would you even offer that?

184
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,440
-You don't think I can win?
-That's not what I'm saying.

185
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,990
[squeaking] Meow. Meow.

186
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,240
I can't tell if you're agreeing to terms
or swearing at me.

187
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,990
-Meow.
-I'll take it as a yes. Deal.

188
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,200
May the cutest baby win.
Jimbo, please stop petting the cat.

189
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,330
Sorry, boss.

190
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,920
How're you gonna get him kicked out
of the house?

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,670
I'm a baby, Staci.
And he's just a household pet.

192
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,220
I just give Mommy and Daddy a choice:
"Whom do you love more?"

193
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,800
-Meow.
-[Mom] Aw!

194
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,270
[Mom chuckling] Aw!

195
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,310
[giggles]

196
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,730
[coos, giggles]

197
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,190
You're both so cute.
I don't know who to hug first.

198
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,780
-[Dad] Same time.
-[parents] Mm!

199
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,780
-Aw.
-Meow.

200
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,160
-[howls]
-Baby, no!

201
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Meow. Meow.

202
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,420
-[wails]
-Honey, the baby is jealous of the kitten.

203
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,960
That's so cute. Quick, take a picture.

204
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,130
[camera shutter clicks]

205
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,960
-Meow.
-[Boss Baby] He's better than I thought.

206
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,090
[Staci] This is how they get you.

207
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,430
Then, one night in your sleep...

208
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,930
[mimics slicing]

209
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,060
I really think I should tell Mom and Dad.

210
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,190
Even if I wanted to,
that's a terrible idea.

211
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,150
Have I told you why Baby Corp
operates in secret?

212
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,030
The company ran some research trials
in Pittsburgh a few years back.

213
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,740
Showed a mommy and daddy the truth
about what Baby Corp does.

214
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,660
It snapped their brains
like the elastic waistband

215
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,620
of some dollar-store swim diaper.

216
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,000
-[babbling]
-[Tim] That's awful!

217
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,460
[Boss Baby] We found them government jobs.
Easy paycheck. No brains required.

218
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,460
[chairman] Chair recognizes the senator

219
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,710
-from the great state of Pennsylvania.
-[babbling]

220
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,510
[audience clapping, cheering]

221
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,800
No running to Mommy and Daddy.
It's my rodeo.

222
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,270
Now, how do I get this cat kicked out
of my house?

223
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,020
-Ideas. Go.
-[giggles]

224
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,140
-Kitten.
-Not an idea. Staci.

225
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,560
What if you broke stuff
and blamed the cat?

226
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,610
Yes. That's the A-game we need.
Gold star for Staci.

227
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,030
In fairness, the cat thought of it first.

228
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,200
-Meow.
-[crashes]

229
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,450
-Timmy! What was that?
-Nothing, Mom.

230
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,370
-Meow.
-[gasps]

231
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,450
[crashing]

232
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,500
-Meow. Meow.
-[Boss Baby yelps]

233
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,790
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

234
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,250
-[Dad] What is going on in there?
-It's just the TV.

235
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,750
-[scraping]
-[Tim gasps]

236
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,130
[claws ring]

237
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,430
No.

238
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,840
-Meow.
-[crashes]

239
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,510
[parents] Timmy!

240
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,930
Meow...!

241
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,560
Sorry, I can't take the fall for this.

242
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,730
I get kicked out, I lose everything.
Thanks for being a team player.

243
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,850
What?

244
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,770
[wails] No!

245
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,530
Timothy Templeton!

246
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,860
It wasn't me, Mom. The kitten--

247
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,370
Oh, the kitten was playing football
in the living room?

248
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,330
-What?
-[faint tap]

249
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,540
We'll discuss punishment later.
For now, just go outside.

250
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,460
You can roughhouse out there.

251
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,670
-[whispers] Thank you.
-[Mom] Take the baby with you.

252
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,090
I don't want him around
this broken glass.

253
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,430
Outside? I... I lost.

254
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,980
Forget the stupid contest.
You don't have to go. We can fix this.

255
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,440
No, Templeton. I made a deal.
First out stays out.

256
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,320
-And I stand by my word.
-[cat squeaks]

257
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,440
Meow!

258
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:29,370
Bootsy Calico, I can't say I like you,
but I respect a challenge well played.

259
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,370
Now!

260
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,790
[yowls]

261
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,130
-First out stay out. Boom! Still got it.
-[Staci] Yay!

262
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,920
Did your plan have to include
getting me in trouble?

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,590
-Sure. Let's say it did.
-Meow.

264
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,590
Meow.

265
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,390
Gracious in defeat. I respect that.

266
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,350
I'll take that victory handshake.

267
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,640
-[faint creaking]
-Huh?

268
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,680
[gasps]

269
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,350
Boss!

270
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,190
[Tim] Hey, the stupid contest is over.

271
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,020
My baby brother won.

272
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,030
Cats are anarchists.
They don't play by rules.

273
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,990
Bootsy Calico never wanted
to take me out of the house.

274
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,870
He's here to take me out!

275
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,040
[Boss Baby] Jimbo, stop that.

276
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,790
I can't help it. He's so soft.

277
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,040
-Meow!
-[claws ring]

278
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,880
Scramble and regroup!

279
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,970
-Boss, what do we do?
-I have an idea.

280
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,840
-[thumps]
-Ow!

281
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,180
Vengeance!

282
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,270
That felt good. Thanks for waiting.

283
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,060
Now, what do we do about the cat?
One time when I was in daycare,

284
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,940
a boy kept chasing me, so I told him
to meet me at the slide.

285
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,900
But when he went, I wasn't there.

286
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,860
I was back in his cubbyhole,
filling his lunchbox with centipedes.

287
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,240
[chuckles]

288
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,660
-That's unhelpful, and you terrify me.
-I love that story.

289
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,120
Templeton, you like imagining things.
Imagine me a solution.

290
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,540
Ooh, good idea.

291
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,130
[Tim] There we were, underground,

292
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:09,340
stalked by the king of the space jungle,
the star tiger.

293
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,590
-[growls]
-[Tim] No weapons, no tools.

294
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Oxygen supply running low.
Only one way out.

295
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,100
Space Mom, Space Dad, can you help us?

296
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,940
[parents] Sure, boys.

297
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
[growls]

298
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,400
-That's your plan?
-We have to get Mom and Dad.

299
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,910
-Why?!
-Because that's what kids do.

300
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,990
And you are just a baby!

301
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,910
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

302
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,170
Staci, Jimbo...

303
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,460
-[Staci howls] Ai-yah!
-[thuds]

304
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,710
-[clicks]
-[sighs] I'm sorry, Templeton.

305
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,880
I should never have involved any of you.
This is my fight.

306
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,010
Staci, Jimbo, thank you for your service.
Vaya con baby Dios.

307
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,140
Wait! What are you doing?

308
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,020
I'm gonna bag the tiger. [grunts]

Templeton!

349
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,580
You were right.
Sometimes you can't run to Mom and Dad,

350
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,460
and then you do it yourself,
and it feels awesome!

351

[groans]

352
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,260
That crash made my brain slippery.

353
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,390
I'm proud of you, Timmy.
I thought I had him,

354
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,890
but I'm glad at least one of us--
[gasps]

355
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,430
[Boss Baby] He's still coming!

356

-Hey! Hey! He's not part of this.

358
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,650
-Your beef is with me.
-[moans]

359
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,610
[Boss Baby] Oh, you win. What do you want?
Just leave the kid alone.

360
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,950
Hello, meow-meow.

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,630

368
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,130
[crying]

369
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,970

370
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,220
-The cat! It scratched the baby.
-[surprised yowl]

371
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,890
-That one was definitely profanity.
-[Mom] Oh, my poor sweet baby.

[hisses, snarls]

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,940
And, um...

375
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,200
the cat also cuffed me to this couch

376
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,780
and pulled the couch downstairs,
which was weird, right?

377
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,660
Adrenaline, I guess.

378
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,250
Boys, we are so sorry.

379
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,500
I guess our family wasn't ready
to foster a kitten.

380
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,880
Ah, poor fella. We'll have to call
and break the news to Dr. Calico.

381
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,800
What?

382
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,010
There's an extra "a" in the second "gaa."
Mommy just butchered the pronunciation.

383
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,220
Not "gaa." It's "gaaa."
That changes the whole meaning.

384
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,520
-It doesn't say Bootsy Calico?
-That's not the full message.

385
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,020
It says, "A gift from Bootsy Calico."

386
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,110
Bootsy was never the kitten. He's the vet!

Well, howdy hey, Boss Baby.

390
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,670
[gasps] I thought adults weren't
supposed to know about Baby Corp.

391

You said it snaps their brains.

392
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,430
The man is surrounded by kittens.
Does he look sane to you?

393
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,930
I hope-- ow!
I hope you enjoyed my present-- ow.

394
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,890
But I know you must be--

[chuckles]

you cat-loving psychopath.

-I think it's just a tape.
-I know. Let me have my anger.

That couch thing really did light a fire
in your belly. [chuckles]

409
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,980
Good.
You should act for yourself more often.

410
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,980
And you should tattle
to Mom and Dad more often.

411
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,780
Forget your dumb CEO.
Family doesn't make you soft.

00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,610
-It does a little.
-Fine.

413
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,200
But it also means someone's
always got your back.

00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,830
Templeton,
if you try to hug me right now...

415
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,500
-[chuckles] No. Ew!
-Great. Yay. We learned, we bonded.

Plus side: now we know who our enemy is.

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,050
And we walk away
with all this used kitty litter.

418
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,180
How is that a plus side?

Don't care. Too busy being amazing.
