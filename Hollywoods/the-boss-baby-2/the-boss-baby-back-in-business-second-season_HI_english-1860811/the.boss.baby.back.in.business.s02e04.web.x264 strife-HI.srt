Higher, Templeton. No holding back.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,430
You don't want me to go full rocket boost.

17
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,183
It's too risky. I'm amazing at it.

18
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,662
[Boss Baby] I'm sure you'll have
a long, lavishly paid career

19
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,926
as a professional trampolinist,

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,107
but, for now, I need a new hiding place
for the stinkless serum.

21
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,835
- What was wrong with the basement?
- We have to keep it moving.

22
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,571
I've got Frederic Estes out there
plotting who knows what,

23
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,824
a suspicious grandmother
who won't leave me alone for five minutes,

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,202
and this vial is like a nuclear missile
made out of the crown jewels!

25
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,163
So you're hiding it in a tree
in our backyard.

26
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,042
Hidden in plain sight.
Our enemies will never suspect it.

27
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,337
They don't have to suspect it.
It's in plain sight.

28
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,631
- Just rocket boost me, man.
- Fine!

Oh, my tree.

00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,559
[yells, grunts] My ribs.

00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,269
Oh, my bad.

35
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,479
Whoa... [gasps]

36
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,482
- My serum again.
- [grunts] My head!

37
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,971
- [Boss Baby] My face!
- My back!

You've got six seconds
to come up with a plausible cover lie.

46
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,548
- I believe in you.
- What?

47
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,792
- Timmy!
- [Boss Baby babbles]

48
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,093
Are you okay? What happened?

49
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,973
The baby ran away, but I saved the baby,
and I'm a hero probably.

50
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,850
Really?

51
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,518
[Gigi] Ran away, Ted.

52
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,271
Your baby's been out of control
since I got here.

53
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,275
I can't take my eyes off him for five
seconds before he's getting into this,

54
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,111
causing trouble with that,
disappearing into who knows where.

55
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,032
- Tim was never like this.
- Yes! Still the good kid.

56
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,784
Sorry.

57
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,619
I panic around authority figures.

58
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,038
Noted. If you'll excuse me...

59
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,207
Ixnay, runaway. Baby stays put.

60
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,084
Timmy, pin him down if you have to.

[groans]

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,090
How am I supposed
to keep babies number one in the world

63
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
if I can't even get out in the world?

64
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,803
She's all over me like ointment on a rash.

65
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,680
Why would you purposely be the rash
in your own story?

66
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,016
Focus, Templeton. I need Gigi off my back.

67
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,019
You're good with old people.
How do you get rid of one?

68
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,856
- Temporarily.
- You heard her.

69
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,235
She feels like she can't leave you alone,
and can you blame her?

70
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,070
You fight her on everything.

71
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,947
[chuckles] Of course I do.

72
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,032
How else is she supposed to learn
I'm the boss?

73
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,827
- You want Gigi off your back?
- I literally just said I did.

74
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,328
Then you back off.

75
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:27,582
You and Gigi are my two favorite people
younger than me or twice as old as Dad.

76
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,376
Just try being good for her.

77
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,170
I'd rather drink a bottle of spiders.

78
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,758
Okay, your dad tells me the library
does a tiny tots story hour.

79
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,636
Some bright-eyed college kid
reading picture books about,

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,305
I don't know, magic bears and crap. Ugh.

81
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,225
I guess your parents think
baby needs some stimulation.

82
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,601
I don't know.

83
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,228
What do you think, Timmy?

84
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,188
I think it's a great idea.

85
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,648
You get an hour of quiet,

86
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,193
and baby gets a chance
to prove how good he can be.

87
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,488
Plus, they have comic books.

88
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,073
- [Boss Baby screaming]
- [Tim groans]

89
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,950
Ow!

90
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,997
- Oh, no, you don't, mister. Get... No!
- Hey!

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,040
- Head him off, Tim.
- [crying, grunts]

92
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,585
- I got that baby!
- [Gigi] Hooah!

93
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,670
This will never be forgiven.

94
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,575
[Gigi] You got room for one more?

95
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,009
There's always room in story hour.

96
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,387
Just find baby a place
on the magic carpet,

97
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,224
and we'll get started in two shakes
of a unicorn's tail.

98
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,601
[babies babbling]

99
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,397
She seems nice. Behave.

[giggles]

101
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,486
Comics!

102
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,405
We're getting farther
from the goal here, Templeton.

103
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,199
How does this get me back
out in the field?

104
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,826
Easy. You want Gigi
to leave you alone for a while,

105
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,579
show her you can be good for a while.
Like an hour.

106
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,041
Like a story hour.

107
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,043
Yes, Templeton, I got it.

108
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,212
- Come on, who's a big boy?
- [laughing]

109
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,047
Who's a big boy?

110
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,925
- Krav Maga finger lock!
- [Tim yells]

111
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,010
I am a big boy.

112
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,055
[sighs] Understood.
I'm gonna go read comics.

113
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,766
- [chuckles]
- [Staci] Boss?

114
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,979
- Since when do <i>you</i> come here?
- Since when do <i>you</i> come here?

115
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,149
Ah, got hooked when I did my stretch
in daycare.

116
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:20,362
The sweet mellow bliss of story hour
was the only thing that kept me sane.

117
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:25,450
So to be clear, the person I deal with
on a daily basis is sane Staci?

118
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,452
[laughs maniacally]

119
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,370
Yes.

120
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,915
And I love picture books
and human companionship.

121
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,458
Oh, happy for both of you.

122
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,002
What's the fastest way
to ditch this dog and pony show?

123
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:40,215
- The sooner I get out of here...
- Where did baby's bottle go?

124
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,466
The better.

125
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,590
- Why is that child missing his bottle?
- [shushing]

126
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,221
Is it under his pillow?

127
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,028
Makes sense.
Sometimes mine rolls under...

128
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,474
No.

129
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,309
[groans] Well, now it's a mystery.

130
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,562
Is it under his crib?

131
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,397
Nope. Just Teddy.

132
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,483
Question the bear. He knows something.

133
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:03,280
Is it under the rhinoceros?
Ooh, I hope not.

134
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,158
[laughs] That's absurd.
Why would it even be there?

135
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,287
Hmm. Where is baby's bottle?

136
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,581
Come on, woman, quit giving the hard sell.

137
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,459
Mommy has it, all warmed up.

138
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,087
- Oh, thank goodness.
- [babies giggling]

139
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,756
Sure you wouldn't rather drink spiders?

140
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,761
I suppose, if it'll keep Gigi off my back,

141
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,556
I could sit and be good
for one more story.

142
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,892
Boom went the cannon,
sploosh went the ship

143
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:37,147
and down went the dirty, surly,
scurvy pirate.

144
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,190
Ha-ha! Arrgghhh.

145
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:45,447
And when little lost gorilla
looked around, he was all alone.

146
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,701
Dinosaur, you don't wear pajamas.

147
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,786
[laughing]

148
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,670
And when the kindly old leopard told
the little lost gorilla, "You <i>are</i> home"...

149
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,090
[gasps, stammers]...I felt something.
I mean, right here.

150
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,761
Well, look who sat and played nice
for a whole hour.

151
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,512
What a surprisingly good boy.

152
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,765
Yeah, I think he really liked it.

153
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,142
Can the baby and me go play
in our room for a while?

154
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,020
Sure. He seems well-behaved today.

155
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,480
Thanks, Gigi.

156
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,690
Well, look at that.

157
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,069
You played nice for a while,
and now you're free to go do business.

158
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,199
You really want me to say you were right,
don't you?

159
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,951
- I do.
- [Gigi] What do you think, Timmy?

160
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,578
- Story hour again tomorrow?
- Sure.

161
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm so glad we found something you like,

162
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,254
and I had a great time reading
trashy magazines with the other seniors.

163
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,925
In fact, I was telling Frederic
how lucky it was to find something

164
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,718
the babies all enjoy so much.

165
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,303
You told Frederic?

166
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,515
Frederic Estes,
and these are my associates,

167
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,017
the Consortium of Ancients.

168
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,560
[all grunt]

169
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,771
It's lovely to meet you.

170
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:04,901
Would I be correct
if I called this place a library?

171
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,029
Yes, of course you would.

172
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:14,577
And this library is a place
where everyone is supposed to... shh.

173
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,248
It's our most important rule.

174
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,458
Well, then,

175
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,045
- I'd say these babies don't belong here.
- What?

176
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,006
Do they?

177
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,758
But... this is story hour.

178
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,013
And you go on and read
your hippy-dippy picture books.

179
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:37,976
But rules is rules:
any baby makes any loud noises...

180
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,061
pfft! Outta here!

181
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,437
Uhh...

182
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,232
Courtesy of local law enforcement.

183
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,279
I literally have nothing better to do
right now. I hate crime.

184
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,531
It's an old-fashioned turf war.

185
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,950
Estes and his gang
are trying to muscle us out,

186
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,910
take this library for themselves.

187
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,787
They can't take story hour!

188
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,290
I need my stories, man. Lookit.

189
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,125
My shiv hand is getting antsy.

190
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,920
Well, my tiny tots, rules are rules.

191
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:11,134
No noises, or the nice policeman
will have to take you bye-bye.

192
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:15,597
I'm sure you can all be
on your very quietest behavior. Right?

193
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,309
[giggles]

194
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,352
[man grunts]

195
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,481
[Officer Doug] I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm sworn to uphold the law.

196
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,232
[seniors grumbling]

197
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,987
[grumbling]

198
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,699
This library is baby territory.
We are not giving it up.

199
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,202
Stay strong, stay silent.

200
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,788
Can you see the puppy?

201
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,625
[giggles, grunts]

202
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,977
- [Officer Doug] Sorry.
- Wha...?

203
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,379
Uh-oh, Badger spilled his applesauce.

204
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,091
[giggles, gasps]

205
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,176
Caterpillar.

206
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,469
[squeals]

207
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,098
[librarian] Upside down!

208
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,891
[babbling]

209
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,352
[Officer Doug] Sorry. Sorry.

210
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,231
Boss, I can't.
My mouth keeps wanting to say things.

211
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,983
Hang on, Jimbo. Don't let the oldies win.

212
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,320
Who could it be? Boo!

213
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,072
[shrieks]

214
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,199
Uh-oh.

215
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,372
[chair scraping]

216
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,250
[senior grumbling]

217
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,337
Gigi, Frederic Estes is being evil again.

218
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,423
The "no loud noises" thing?
It is a library, Tim.

219
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,591
Maybe we should just go.

220
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,761
You kidding? This place is the first peace
I've gotten since I moved in.

221
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,598
Your brother's been on his best behavior.
He'll be fine.

222
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,231
Okay, who wants to read a book
about kittens?

223
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,650
[Staci growls, squeaks]

224
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,363
Throwing up wherever he pleases?
Is that how Janice raised your boy, Ted?

225
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,615
He got kicked out of the public library.

226
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,993
[groans] How bad was the fallout
after I got the boot?

227
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,911
Timmy, of course, was a perfect angel.

228
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,914
Yes! Still the good kid.

229
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,917
- I assume no more story hour.
- Even worse.

230
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,004
Estes got them to turn it into
"no babies" hour.

231
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,507
If they even see a baby in there
between 11 and noon,

232
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,720
all babies will be banned
from the library, any time, forever.

233
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,513
Ugh, Estes!

234
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,933
And Gigi's probably never gonna trust you
out of her sight again.

235
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,727
- Ugh, Gigi!
- [monitor chimes, vibrates]

236
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,728
[Jimbo] <i>Boss.</i>

237
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,811
Uh, Jimbo?

238
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,441
<i>- Uh, we got a situation.</i>
- Yeah, sorry about story hour.

239
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,776
We'll take our library back,
don't you worry.

240
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,237
- How you holding up, big guy?
<i>- I'm fine, thanks.</i>

241
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,322
[Staci screaming]

242
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,867
<i>- Staci's not.</i>
- [ragged panting]

243
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,662
<i>I told you, boss. I need my stories.</i>

244
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,289
<i>They keep me in my happy place,</i>

245
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,750
<i>and you do not want me
in my unhappy place!</i>

246
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,836
Stay happy, stay happy. I'll fix this.

247
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,505
[grunts, clears throat]

248
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,925
Templeton,
you've got a basic public education.

249
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,510
How'd you like to fill in
for emergency story hour?

250
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,305
Better idea.

251
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,642
So if you read the stories,
it's a win for everybody.

252
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,768
I don't follow.

253
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,395
He gets stories,
you get him calm and quiet.

254
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,023
Why can't you just read him the stories?

255
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,651
Because I want the two of you
to get along,

256
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,814
and then you learn to trust the baby
and won't have to watch him all the time,

257
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,699
and everybody stays completely sane.

258
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,283
[sighs]

259
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,955
Aw. I could never say no to my Timmy.

260
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,207
Yes! Story hour with Gigi.

261
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,793
I'm gonna go invite the baby's friends.
Love you.

262
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,711
That baby has friends?

263
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,384
[Staci squeals quietly]

264
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,467
[giggles]

265
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,012
- How does this work?
- You just read.

266
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,347
Pick anything.

267
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,353
Hmm. <i>The Sassy, Gassy Crocodile.</i>

268
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,023
Nope, nope, and nope.

269
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,776
[gasps, grunting]

270
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,866
"'Oh, no, ' said Hippo sadly.
'All my friends forgot my birthday.'"

271
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,161
Ugh. Don't tell me.
They're planning a surprise party.

272
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,248
Yep, there it is. Shocker.
[blows raspberry]

273
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,583
I did not see that coming.

274
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:17,130
Does this family own any storybooks
that aren't flaming garbage?

275
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,881
[whimpering]

276
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,512
They're babies, Gigi.
They like this stuff.

277
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,807
I'm not cut out for soft
and fuzzy nonsense.

278
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,225
I'm from steel country.

279
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,561
Spent my life in the mill,
turning fire into metal

280
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,480
and beating down any goon squads
who tried to break our union.

281
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,357
[babies giggle and coo]

282
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,610
Goon beating,
that's what gets your attention.

283
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,657
- If it works, it works.
- All right, kiddos.

284
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,826
We're playin' this Gigi style.

285
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,120
"Union," we'd shout.

286
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,790
And oh, boy, did we give 'em what for.
Boom!

287
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,375
[fighting grunts]

288
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,002
[babies giggling]

289
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,296
I can't believe this is actually working.

290
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,631
Another win for bonding with Gigi.

291
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,428
And as Henry the boilermaker
lay there, two words escaped his lips.

292
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,474
"Avenge me."

293
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,435
[angry grunts]

294
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,105
Well, if you've ever been hit with brass
knuckles, you know how that feels.

295
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,441
[growling]

296
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,234
This kid gets me.

297
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,029
You better believe we stood our ground.

298
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,282
Somebody tries to take something from you
in this life, what do you do?

299
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,950
You take it right back!

300
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,370
[combat scream]

301
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,246
Oh, my, is she okay?

302
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,873
[growling and snarling]

303
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,459
[Tim] Staci!

304
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,170
Did you see which way she went?

305
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,964
And there goes Gigi's story time.

306
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,177
- [Tim] Babies, no.
- What in the world?

307
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,720
Don't worry. I'll go after them.

308
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,597
Timmy! What?

309
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:00,941
[whistles]

310
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,290
[grunts, laughs]

311
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,751
[howls]

312
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,255
Oh, no.

313
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,298
What is that place?

314
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,385
[Boss Baby] The public library.

315
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,681
"Hollywood, the government
and young people.

316
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,684
Are they plotting
to steal your silverware?

317
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,351
Yes."

318
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,020
- Oh, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

319
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,065
- [vent cover slams]
- [Staci chuckles]

320
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,945
I should probably see what's going on.

321
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,989
[groans]

322
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,590
[gasps]

323
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,967
What are you doing here?

324
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,969
Your grandma was right.

325
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,098
Frederic and his old people gang took
this library from us, so what do we do?

326
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,935
We take it back. [shrieks] Union!

327
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,533
[groans, grunts]

328
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,454
This place is crawling with seniors.

329
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,548
I would love to take back our library
from them, but we need a plan.

330
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,883
Got one.

331
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,388
- [groans] Dagnabit!
- Sir, this is a library.

332
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,891
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

333
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,560
Horse apples. I pay my taxes.

334
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,523
Miss Summer's right.
You're outta here, Mister Loud Noise Man.

335
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,942
Wow, good thing I never leave this place.

336
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,360
This could actually work.

337
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,278
[Tim] Are you insane?

338
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,696
It's grown-ups only hour.

339
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,867
If they spot any of you here, they'll ban
babies from this library forever.

340
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,538
Well, then I guess we'd better
not get caught. Right, Staci?

341
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,499
[chuckling]

342
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,545
Babies!

343
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,339
Shh. That's not a baby, ma'am.

344
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,258
That's a big boy,

345
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,427
and you're gonna need to take
that yelling outside.

346
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,887
March.

347
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:39,267
Keep the librarian distracted.
We'll take care of the old people.

348
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,402
Here, little baby. Did you get lost?

349
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,822
This is Consortium of Ancients turf now.

350
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
[Staci giggles]

351
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,374
[loud grunt] Gosh-all hemlock!

352
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,462
[echoing giggle]

353
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,762

[whispering] Mama.

356

357
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,829
- [Boss Baby and Jimbo giggling]
- Huh?

358
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,295
Sorry to keep distracting you
for absolutely no reason involving babies,

359
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:53,257
but are you telling me
there's now a fiction and a nonfiction?

360
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,508
- Mm-hmm.
- [woman grunting]

361
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,511
And what would you say is the difference
between the two?

362
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,139
Well, one is fictional,
and the other isn't.

363
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,641
Fascinating.

364
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,560
Might you direct me
to some of your nonfiction-iest books?

365
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,770
Of course.

366
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,522
And aren't you the most polite
young man I've ever...

367
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,899
[woman] Thunderation!

368
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,277
There's babies right over there!

369
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,575
Some people have no respect
for library etiquette.

370
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,245
Sorry, Meemaw. Love you.

371
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,873
You're out of the will.

372
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,877
I never felt so alive, sir.

373
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,463
Tell me there's more of 'em. Who's next?

374
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,881
Only one senior left.

375
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,592
The Big Kahuna. Where's Estes?

376
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,935
[chuckles]

377

Steel implants.
Lost both my buttocks in the war.

379
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,784
Wave bye-bye to the library forever,
babies.

380
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,371
[laughs] I feel like such a fool.

381
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,750
Here I was,
calling it the Doody Decimal System.

382
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,003
- [laughs] Doody.
- [Staci screaming]

383
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,105
- [babies babbling]
- What's that noise?

384
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,298
I'm sure it's fine.

385
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,925
Tell me more about these newspapers
on sticks.

386
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,177
[Estes grunting]

387
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,012
I should really look.

388
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,138
I looked for you.

389
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,224
Turns out, nothing there. Whoo!

390
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:13,272
- I'm just gonna turn around for one sec.
- [distorted] No!

391
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:20,237
Where are those babies? [panting]

392
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,364
Shh.

393
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,705
Eww-eww-eww!

394
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,834
That'll be quite enough
from our noisy seniors today, thank you.

395
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,044
The babies!

396
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,296
What about the babies?

397
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,049
Don't worry, Gigi.
I'll get them all home safe.

398
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,259
[whispers] I feel so good about this day.

399
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,385
Nice work, Templeton.

400
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,222
Dodging a police officer
and distracting a librarian?

401
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,308
I'd say you've gotten over your panic
around authority figures.

402
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,811
Hmm. Still one more to go.

403
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,065
I know you're upset they banned you
from the library for life.

404
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,691
Eh, I hate the quiet.

405
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,403
I just thought for a minute there,
I actually was bonding with this one.

406
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,948
What are you talking about?
You totally bonded with him.

407
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,992
He saw a baby in trouble,
and his first instinct was to go help.

408
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:10,079
Sticking together,
just like your union stories

409
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,498
or like a family.

410
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,876
Let's call you a work in progress.

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,086
[Boss Baby coos]

412
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,754
Same to you, Gigi.

413
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,965
Yes! I am calling that a win.

414
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,342
Whoo!

415
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,304
[Summer] The angry seniors were banished,

416
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,891
and with no one left to object,
the tiny tots returned,

417
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:35,312
and they all had story hour
happily ever after.

418
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,606
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

419
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,608
That's the good stuff.
