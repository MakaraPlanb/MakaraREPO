Old people. The wrinkled menace.

15
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,262
I agree they're shady, sir,
but how are they a menace?

16
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:57,224
Babies are the most adorable,
lovable things on the planet.

17
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:01,853
Old folks are like the raisins of people,
and we're the chocolate chips.

18
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,190
It's not what they are, Stace.
It's what they want.

19
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:11,029
Mashed food, warm milk, frequent naps,
their family's constant attention.

20
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,365
Quality diaper products.

21
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,118
- I like all those things.
- Exactly.

22
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,036
I can't believe we didn't see it sooner.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,497
Old people
are babies' natural competitors.

24
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,416
- [gasps]
- Indeed.

25
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,044
How long before they come
after babies' share of the world's love?

26
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,921
- Uh...
- Don't answer! Too late.

27
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,758
Because unless I'm mistaken, not possible,
one of these old people

28
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,803
is already looking to take babies down.

29
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,471
Frederic Estes.

30
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,472
[both gasp]

31
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,267
I think he's onto us and after us.

32
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,438
- He could be the next Bootsy Calico!
- Not if we stop him now.

33
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,315
Can you please wrap this up?

34
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,944
Oh, sorry, temporary summertime roommate.
We'll try to keep it down.

35
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,865
We can't sit around and wait for this
crank to blossom into another archnemesis.

36
00:01:54,948 --> 00:02:00,454
No. We're gonna protect Baby Corp's love
and make a splash with our new CEO.

37
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:05,000
- This time, we strike first.
- Yes, yes, yes!

38
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,337
Jiminy Christmas, you guys.
Don't tell Mom I swore.

39
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,380
Strike plan. Ideas by tomorrow.

40
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,051
I want Frederic Estes' head on a platter
for Turtleneck Superstar CEO Baby

41
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,734
- by the end of the week.
- [Staci] Yeah!

42
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,221
Head guts! Let's ride.

43
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,807
- [Jimbo neighs]
- [Staci laughs]

44
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,601
It's a figure of speech, Staci.

45
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,978
We're not severing any actual...
Well, she's excited.

46
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,357
How about you, Templeton?
Any anti-Estes ideas?

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,069
Really not getting involved in this one.
I like old people.

48
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,195
[Boss Baby laughs]

49
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,155
Classic Templeton.

50
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,657
I'm serious.

51
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,117
Bootsy Calico and his cats
were freaky and evil,

52
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,078
but old people aren't either
of those things.

53
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,997
- They make me happy.
- That's mathematically impossible.

54
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:47,459
You're over a thousand percent closer
to baby age than old people age.

55
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,212
How could they possibly make you happy?

56
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,091
- Oh, this is about her.
- [Gigi] Knock, knock.

57
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,803
Is it too late to say good night
to my big grandson?

58
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,805
Not for either one of us.

59
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,808
What in... Did you let him out of his crib?

60
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,978
Uh, I guess that's the only explanation
that makes sense.

61
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:07,938
[Gigi] Unh-unh.

62
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,525
We talked about this, bossy britches.
You don't get to run this house anymore.

63
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,069
Cute and sassy doesn't cut it
with your Gigi.

64
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,737
- [Boss Baby farts, giggles]
- Ugh!

65
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,032
Oh, we are gonna work on that attitude
this summer.

66
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,410
And as for you, young man,

67
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,037
did somebody place an order
at the tickle factory?

68
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,581
Oh, no, I ordered too many.
Send them back!

69
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,500
[Gigi laughs]

70
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,460
Good night, Timmy.

71
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,716
[blows raspberry]

72
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,845
[laughs] She's the best.
You two should try harder to get along.

73
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,098
I like you and I like her,
so, mathematically,

74
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,892
that's like a thousand percent chance
you'll like each other.

75
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,644
[groans] Public schools.

76
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,273
Brass tacks, Templeton.
I'm a baby, she's a senior citizen.

77
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,568
War's coming,
and Gigi and I are in opposite camps.

78
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,321
Sooner or later, you have to pick a side.

79
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,493
- Pick Team Baby!
- [Tim yells]

80
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,830
These are your Frederic Estes
strike plans?

81
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,915
Nunchucks are the only plan I need.

82
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,835
And I brought this thumb
to agree with Staci's plan.

83
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,919
[groaning]

84
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,504
We have to send a message.

85
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,049
Humiliate Estes,
let him know this is a baby town.

86
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,927
You come after our love,
we don't run and hide.

87
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,655
- [Tim and Gigi laugh]
- Ahh! Run and hide!

88
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,766
- You're gonna be on TV?
- [chuckles] Maybe.

89
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,476
Marsha Krinkle's doing a fluff piece

90
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,770
on a charity pinochle tournament
at the senior center.

91
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,605
It was my friend Frederic's idea.

92
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,688
Hmm?

93
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,817
- You wanna come?
- You think I could be on TV?

94
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,696
Who knows? I made the local news once.
Well, my mug shot did.

95
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,115
The boss tried to take away
our dental plan,

96
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,993
so I cracked his tooth with a forearm.
[cracking sound]

97
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,040
- I could make cookies for the old folks.
- Oh, sure. That'd be easier.

98
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,963
Start your baking and we'll head over
in a bit.

99
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,253
I'm gonna be on TV!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

100
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:01,468
- Jimbo, Staci, I have our strike plan.
- [Staci and Jimbo giggle]

101
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:07,057
Hi, I'm Timothy Templeton.
Hello, I'm Timothy Templeton.

102
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,351
- Shalom, I'm Tim...
- Templeton!

103
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,145
Stirring like a real pro.
What you got there, cookies?

104
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:16,358
- I'm gonna be on TV.
- Hey, hey! Check out Mr. Big Time.

Better get Mom and Dad's help
turning on the oven.

Don't wanna burn your eyebrows off
before your big debut, champ. [laughs]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

115

Black pepper, ground extra fine. [sneezes]

116
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,975
Don't worry about it, Stace.
This is for the old people.

Could this be any more adorable?</i>

Meet my grandson.</i>

123
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,667

Hey, I know that kid!

00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,590
Yeah! Go, Tim. Go, Mom!

Whoa, is it allergy season?
What's going around the infirmary here?

134
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,284
[sneezes] My dentures!

135
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,995
Ugh! Roosevelt, something's going down.

136
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,955

Hey, what's happening?

141
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,680
So you baked these cookies yourself.
Hmm.

142
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,349
Roosevelt, smell that news.

143
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,477
I smell bubble gum. Loosens the dentures.

144
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,897
Pepper, makes you sneeze.
And I smell a very big story.

145
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,774
I'm really gonna shake this camera,
Marsha.

146
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,484
Shake it, shake it, shakety-shake.

Age envy? Grampy never hugged you?</i>

<i>What? No! I didn't...</i>

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,660
<i>What's the point in making old people
look super gross?</i>

<i>You! You're watching, aren't you?</i>

00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,836
Can... can he see us?
No, that's crazy, right?

153
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,588
You did this.

154
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,549
What did we do?
Where did we go wrong, son?

[door bangs]

161
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,823
- How could you do that to us?
- Templeton, I did it to Estes.

162
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,534
You made me and our Gigi look terrible.

163
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,329
I'm sorry you were collateral damage,
Templeton, but we had to be proactive.

164
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,790
We can't let old people
cut into our love share.

165
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,210
- Not happening now, am I right?
- Team Baby!

00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,423
Come on, join us. Field team celebration.
You're part of this.

00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,677
I did warn you you'd have to pick a side.

168
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,430
You really gonna throw in
with the flying denture crowd?

169
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,058
I'm not picking sides.
I like babies and old people.

170
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,103
I don't want to be part
of your dirty business.

171
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:45,150
Ha! You can't just walk away from the warm
embrace of Lady Business, Templeton.

172
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:49,154
You've been out there in the sauce.
She's in your veins now.

173
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,698
It'd be like cutting out your own soul.

174
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,367
Then maybe I'll run my own business.

175
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,705
Oh, really?
And what slapdash operation might this be?

176
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,876
- It’s super cool.
- Your business is called "super cool"?

177
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,627
For big kids.

178
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,130
Super cool big kids?

179
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,925
Incorporated. No sides, no enemies.

180
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,929
Just cool people doing fun stuff,
incorporated style.

181
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,475
- That's not a business.
- You're not a business. Boom!

182
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,311
[line rings]

183
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,774
Mmm. Petrosky residence.
A Petrosky speaking.

184
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,443
Danny, it's Tim.
Are you out of summer school yet?

185
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,653
I decided to home summer school.

186
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,282
Oh, well, I was hoping you could come over
and help me start a business.

187
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,618
Love to, but I'm really swamped.

188
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,579
It's called
Super Cool Big Kids Incorporated.

189
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:45,001
Yes! Wait, did you say "super cool"?
I'll be there in one!

190
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,711
[babies laughing]

191
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:53,760
I'm telling you, it was raining dentures.
Estes was, like... [groaning]

192
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,137
- I love that.
- Hey, Double B,

193
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,099
Turtleneck Superstar CEO Baby
wants to see you in her office.

194
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,892
Ah, thanks, Hendershot.

195
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,519
If you'll all excuse me,

196
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,231
I'm off to cleanse myself
in a shower of praise.

197
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,986
[speaks Japanese]

198
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,989
Lots of good news to share.

199
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,119
First and most importantly,
the serum is absolutely secure.

200
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,247
- I guess that isn't so much news as...
- [CEO Baby] Grizzly bears.

201
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,792
- Not where I was going, but...
- When they sleep, do you poke them?

202
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,920
I feel like there's no good answer here.

203
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,881
Frederic Estes. Dangerous? Incredibly.

204
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,008
Ever since you reported him to Baby Corp,

205
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,594
we've had the triplets
on full-time surveillance.

206
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,721
[Triplet 1] <i>Can you see my brain?</i>

207
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,349
[Triplet 2] <i>Just empty darkness
and boogers.</i>

208
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,227
[Triplet 3] <i>I wanna see darkness
and boogers.</i>

209
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,646
<i>- Hey!</i>
- There's about four hours of this.

210
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,148
- But then...
<i>- Give it.</i>

211
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,192
A baby did this!

212
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,443
Uh-oh.

213
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,070
- [sneezes]
- [man shouts]

214
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,700
- Relax, Freddie. Babies are cute.
- I love my grandbabies.

215
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,910
- Do you?
- Yes.

216
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,413
- Do you?
- Yes.

217
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,831
Do you?

218
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,292
Well, now I don't know anymore.

219
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,751
What do babies want?

220
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,338
Mashed food, warm milk, frequent naps,

221
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:17,510
their family's constant attention,
quality diaper products.

222
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,262
I like all those things.

223
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,931
Exactly. We were here first.

224
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,436
Are we going to let these puking punks
take what's ours? No!

225
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,439
<i>Today we start taking it all back!</i>

226
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:36,195
Today, we band together
as the Consortium of Ancients.

227
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,909
- [old woman] Oh, yes!
- Let's teach these babies some manners.

228
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,994
[shouting]

229
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,872
You poked a sleeping grizzly bear.

230
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,167
You started a war
with grandmamas and grandpapas.

231
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,086
You'd better be prepared to win it.

232
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,256
Did you see those dentures flying?
We'll annihilate them!

233
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,842
In market share of love.
No actual homicide.

234
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,802
This ends your portion of my time.

235
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,605
I do have a baby grandson
I'm trying to teach some manners.

236
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,150
<i>- Sure, let's give this a try.
- </i>Gigi.

237
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,945
A great sign is important.

238
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,656
It lets the world know
what we're all about.

239
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,909
Being super cool. No boundaries.

240
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:28,539
I haven't felt this good since my dad
let me eat two whole pies for breakfast.

241
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,500
- [laughs]
- [Boss Baby clears throat]

242
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,254
Excuse me. The baby wants me
to play with him for a second.

243
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,839
[snoring]

244
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,387
Bad news. Gigi's in with Frederic Estes.

245
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,138
Yeah. He's her friend.

246
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,349
Look, I don't have time for enemy stuff.

247
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,019
Danny and I are super busy
just being cool and setting an example

248
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,397
for how everyone else could get along
if they tried.

249
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,316
How is that going to increase
your market share of love?

250
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,277
That's not what
Super Cool Big Kids Incorporated is about.

251
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,197
Your business model is ludicrous!
Sorry, sorry.

252
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,950
Look, I need you to come back
to the field team.

253
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:08,162
- Babies and old people are at war.
- That bad, huh?

254
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,833
I know Gigi's been really mad
since the cookie thing.

255
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,835
You want me to help fix things
between you guys?

256
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,461
No, I wanna win!

257
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,338
There can be only one.

258
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,924
That's what I thought
when you came into this family.

259
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,008
Guess what.

260
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,261
- Uh...
- I was stupid and wrong.

261
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,641
Boom! Super Cool Big Kid style!

262
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,102
[mockingly] "Super Cool Big Kid Style!"

263
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,064
Turns out Estes isn't
the shriveled pushover we anticipated.

264
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,569
We're in for a dogfight, people.
But these dogs are people, people.

265
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,573
Taking candy from a baby.
Sounds easy, right?

266
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,367
Get that outta your heads!

267
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,455
There's nothing easy
about taking back what's ours.

268
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,707
We're gonna bring out their cranky sides,

269
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,334
show everyone that old people

270
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,919
- are nothing but crotchety grumps.
- [whimpers]

271
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,380
We're going to send them
into tantrum mode.

272
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,549
Parents will go nuts.

273
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,510
The world will run back to babies
for the antidote,

274
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,555
adorable giggles and warm snuggles.

275
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,768
The world's gonna need
a lot of quiet afternoons

276
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:17,482
and soothing "back in my day" stories
from their elders.

277
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,859
- [Boss Baby] What do we want?
- Babies number one!

278
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,028
- When do we want it?
- Now!

279
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,988
I don't know, I just like yelling!

280
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,784
So hike up those pants
to action mode because...

281
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,205
- babies are going down!
- Oldies are going down!

282
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,099
- Right after our naps.
- Right after our naps.

283
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,708

00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,712
- To war!
- To war!

00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,131
[old man] Hey, stock boy!

286
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,593
What kind of produce section
only has coconuts?

287
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,430
- We must've sold out!
- [Estes] What? We can't mash these!

288
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,350
What do you think we are,
garbage disposals?

289
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,353
[growls]

290
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:59,399
Please! I have a grandpop.
I like him a lot!

291
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:04,070
Then you should know
he likes bananas, berries, soft foods!

292
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,071
[whimpering]

293
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,991
Nanners, you fool!
What happened to the nanners?

294
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:13,413
We must've sold out!
I don't know, who else likes soft food?

295
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,706
Babies.

296
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:21,671
How is everyone sold out of baby toys?
It's madness. Madness!

[woman gasps]

298
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,218
Hey, she's got a deck of cards. Get her!

299
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,680
Back off! These will give Scooter
two or three minutes of quiet play time,

300
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,223
and they are mine!

301
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,643
What maniac bought all the baby toys?

302
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,019
Old people.

- Oh, my goodness.
- [gasps, grunts]

306
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,199
[gasps] Where did this adorable
giggly baby come from?

307
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,994
I'm sure your mom or dad
will be here soon.

308
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,913
You're too cute to forget about.

309
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,460
Ugh! Ah, forget it!
I flew planes in the war.

310
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,004
- Let's dance, traffic.

- [yells]
- [babies crying]

317
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,111
[man] Somebody turn down the volume
of these babies!

318
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,946
- [shouting]
- [man] Shut up!

319
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,573

Old people!

[groans] Rough night. Look alive, Peg!

325
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,800
We got a war going on.
Where's that morning market report?

326
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,762
Did we crush old people
right off the pie chart yet?

327
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,389
Hang on, still updating.

328
00:16:55,473 --> 00:17:01,062
Okay, see that teeny, tiny sliver in gray?
That is love for old people.

329
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:06,067
Ha! Stay off our turf next time,
you dusty skin racks. Sweet victory.

330
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,862
Hang on.
See that teeny, tiny other sliver?

331
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,573
- That's love for babies!
- What?

332
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,954
How? We're supposed to be...
Wait, who's that big piece of pie, then?

333
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,623
Oh, no. No, unh-unh. No.

334
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,501
[yells, babbles]

335
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,254
- It's okay, he's asleep.
- [sighs]

336
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,631
That kid's really going places, isn't he?

337
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,051
- Okay, Templeton, you were right.
- About what?

338
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,513
Babies made old people look bad,
old people made babies look bad,

339
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,015
and somehow... what are you doing?

340
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,685
Making cool sweatbands
out of shirtsleeves for our business.

341
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,895
- There's a market for that?
- We do our own thing.

342
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,815
That's not a business! Sorry, where was I?

343
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,609
Somehow, by doing your own thing,

344
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,612
big kids like you came out
looking better than all of us,

345
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,030
strictly by default.

346
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,284
- Super cool.
- Yes. Super.

347
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,911
Want some business advice?
Make up with old people.

348
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,081
Learn to be friends with Gigi
and you'll feel so much better.

349
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,164
[gasps]

350
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,296
I guess we have no choice.
We have to get our love share back,

351
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,466
even if that means making friends
with the elderly.

352
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,845
- Really? You promise?
- I promise.

353
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,179
Will you help us?

354
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,805
[Boss Baby] Game day!

355
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,767
Game time? Game o'clock?
I never get into sports metaphors.

356
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,102
Tim, progress report.

357
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,104
Gigi put the word out
to the senior center.

358
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,565
Bocce tournament, three p.m. at the park.

359
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,775
Word traveled fast. She's very gossipy.

360
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,861
One of her many winning traits.

361
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,239
And Danny put up hundreds of fliers
for the big baby playdate.

362
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,033
Three p.m. at the park.

363
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,828
Well, that's babies and old people headed
for the same place, same time.

364
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,331
- I hope this works.
- It's a great plan.

365
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,458
You guys just hang out, be super cool,

366
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,668
and I think you'll see
that old people are, too.

367
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:51,839
Excellent work, Templeton.
Thank you. We'll take it from here.

368
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,927
All clear.
Time to commence Operation Endgame.

369
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,931
[Boss Baby] <i>Bocce, a game played
with brightly colored balls.</i>

370
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:04,810
<i>Old people love it,
and they take it very seriously.</i>

371
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,607
<i>Babies. You know what they love?
Brightly colored balls.</i>

372
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,692
Match, meet fuse.

373
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,611
Marsha Krinkle, Channel Eight News.

374
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,074
I'm standing next to a man who once shot
his teeth at me like a mouth cannon.

375
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,370
- So, where's the news coming from today?
- [chuckles] No news.

376
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:26,624
Just old people enjoying a park
that rightfully belongs to them,

377
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,252
- free from the tyranny of tiny...
- [old woman] Babies!

378
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,089
- [old woman growls]
- [cooing, giggling]

379
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,757
[overlapping exclamations]

380
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,011
- [Staci] That's gonna get ugly.
- Old people yelling at babies?

381
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:43,057
- "Ugly" doesn't cover the half of it.
- Hands off my bocce ball!

382
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,184
[Boss Baby]
They're gonna look like monsters.

383
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,186
[Gigi] Hand it over, kiddo.

384
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,064
What is with the babies in this town?
No manners, no respect.

385
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,483
- Breaking scandal in Dangerous Well Park.
- Aah!

386
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,861
This cranky coot
is taking a toy away from a baby.

387
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,823
Oh, this isn't what it looks like.

388
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,408
[sobbing]

389
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,326
What is wrong with you?

390
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,413
- I didn't mean to...
- Don't back down, Mrs. Templeton.

391
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:09,125
These babies need to learn their place,
once and for all.

392
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,004
For justice, for bocce,
and the Consortium of...

393
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,299
Milk and cookies!
Get your milk and cookies.

394
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:21,429
Free refreshments
from Super Cool Big Kids Incorporated.

395
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,181
What's he doing here?
This isn't part of the plan.

396
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,307
- [Tim] No.
- [all gasp]

397
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,892
It's part of my plan.

398
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,521
I saw you crossing your fingers
in the reflection of Danny's sunglasses.

399
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,857
I promise.

400
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,111
- [Tim] So I'm stopping this myself.
- [gasps]

401
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,865
With one snack
old people and babies can both agree on.

402
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,033
See? You're not so different after all.

403
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,121
- Want some?
- White heaven? Of course I do.

404
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,373
This changes nothing.

405
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,334
Those old people
are still riled up about their bocce.

406
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,629
When the snacks run dry,
it's gonna get ugly.

407
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:01,093
And you'll still have to choose
which side you're... [gasps]

408
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,097
Templeton! This milk is warm!

409
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,770
[yawns]

410
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:16,776
- [slurring] How dare you!
- Night-night, baby.

411
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,570
[slow-motion yelling] No!

412
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,990
[Boss Baby snores, groans]

413
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,033
What happened?

414
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,286
- Why is the park our house now?
- Shh.

415
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,081
<i>An incredible scene
of outrageous adorableness today...</i>

416
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,165
No.

417
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:37,630
<i>...as a group of pudgy babies took
their nappy-nap with these silver seniors.</i>

418
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,217
Wake up, don't look so peaceful!
You're with an old person!

419
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,303
- This can't be happening.
- It already happened.

420
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,139
Timmy, I'm off to protest
a new grocery store opening

421
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,391
at the site of an old grocery store.
Wanna come?

422
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,644
No, thanks. I'm hanging out with the baby.

423
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,481
- [cooing]
- Oh, it's you. Hey.

424
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:57,983
[Boss Baby grunts]

425
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,486
I know this is weird.
You're both new to each other.

426
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,113
But whatever happens
between babies and old people,

427
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,865
it doesn't come into this house.

428
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,452
Family is a circle.
Nobody should have to pick sides.

429
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:14,500
<i>Old and young wrapped warmly
in each other's unnatural embrace.</i>

430
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,628
<i>Cute as a koala on a silk pillow.</i>

431
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:22,967
- Okay. Family's off-limits.
- Pleasure doing business with you.

432
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,052
I think all of us seniors realize

433
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,346
that ain't the way
to raise our grandbabies.

434
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,723
You and me,
we work this out between us.

435
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,518
No more Consortium of Ancients.

436
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,522
Consortium of Ancients forever!

437
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,317
