I'm the new CEO...

19
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,364
What are you people doing in my office?

20
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,492
Frederic Estes kidnapped
Turtleneck Superstar CEO Baby.

21
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,411
Yes!

22
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,039
I mean, obviously,
I'm also worried about her safety,

23
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,000
but don't you see the opportunity here?

24
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,166
Not really.

25
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,879
Leadership.
Every new CEO has to make a big splash,

26
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,090
seize the loyalty of his team.

27
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,302
What better way than a high-stakes
rescue operation?

28
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,387
[laughs]

29
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,680
What's this other one?

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,848
Nothing. It's just...

31
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,600
"To my baby brother." In your handwriting?

32
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,478
A congratulations note.
Templeton, I'm blushing.

33
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,063
Don't read it right now. It's for...

34
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:50,277
- You're quitting?
- No!

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,404
I told you, like, 20 minutes ago.

36
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,908
I already forgot!

37
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,079
- Why?
- It's all in the letter, okay?

38
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,041
But forget that for now.
We have to rescue Turtleneck.

39
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,710
After that,
you can read what I wrote and... Hey!

40
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,545
Resignation not accepted.

41
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,839
But I double-checked my spelling
and everything.

42
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,009
This is it, Templeton!
We're finally in charge.

43
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,511
This is where the real fun starts.

44
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:20,307
Did you know this company has a fleet
of fully-loaded baby assault vehicles?

45
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,017
- I didn't.
- You do now!

46
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,978
- Staci, put in a requisition.
- On it.

47
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,274
- Jimbo, show me your war face.
- [shrieking]

48
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,777
Let's rain down baby fury.

49
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,364
- I'm still quitting after this.
- [chuckles] Sure you are.

50
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,575
Now, how do we locate
a rotten syndicate of old people?

51
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,327
- With an old person...
- No!

52
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,245
[Templeton] Gigi!

53
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,582
[grunts] Templeton,
I'm Baby Corp's new CEO!

54
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,959
I can't go running for help
to our elderly enemies!

55
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,878
Gigi's our grandma.

56
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,838
And she'll know
where we can find Frederic.

57
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,883
[sighs] Just get the info.
Don't tell me where it comes from.

58
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,387
- It will be from Gigi! Oof!
- Ga-ga, goo-goo, cannot hear you.

59
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,639
- [Gigi] Tim!
- She's been turned! Take her out!

60
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,682
I'm so sorry!

61
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,684
I didn't realize you were there!

62
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,355
[giggling]

63
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,192
- How did the baby...?
- Wait. You're leaving today?

64
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,944
It's the End O' Summer.

65
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,707
Heading back home
right after the festival.

66
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,989
- But...
- [Boss coughing, mumbling]

67
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,242
Speaking of talking,

68
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,203
do you know where Frederic Estes is,
for no reason you should ask about?

69
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,373
Well, sure. He's at the festival
like everyone else.

70
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,377
He and his senior friends
even put together their own fun house.

71
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,045
Ha! What a hoot!

72
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,713
[door opens]

73
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,692
That has to be where
they're holding Turtleneck.

74
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,927
Your mom and dad are off rehearsing
for the big festival finale,

75
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,929
so I thought the rest of us
could go together.

76
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,514
- One last...
- Going ahead.

77
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,057
You catch up! Love you! Bye!

78
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,183
[bell dinging]

79
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,022
[gasps] I need backup!

80
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,149
Whoa! [thuds]

81
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,112
There it is: One big fat mousetrap.

82
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,990
- [grunts] What?
- You're killing me, man-baby.

83
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,600
Don't look straight in the camera.

84
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,452
Why is Hendershot filming us?

85
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,621
Leadership, Templeton.
I clawed my way to the top.

86
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,083
Now I show Baby Corp
what a real CEO looks like.

87
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,836
[Hendershot] And... put some mustard
on it this time.

88

<i>Estes' fun house.
It's one big fat mousetrap.</i>

89
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,802
<i>But Baby Corp is a tiger,</i>

90
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,014
<i>and you can't catch a tiger
in a mousetrap.</i>

91
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,683
- Great line!
- Great CEO!

92
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,352
He says I'm a tiger! [roars]

93
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,687
Ow! Quit it!

94
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,232

- [baby] Yeah!

95
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:38,278

- Because I'm the boss, baby.</i>

Aw! How cute! They have baby rides!

101
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:59,174
Go get them, Staci! Yee-haw!
I've never said "yee-haw" before.

102
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,092
I love the new CEO me!

[Boss] Baby steps.
And watch your diapered backsides.

112

Ugh, fine.

[screams, grunts]

174
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,618
The camera makes me feel throw-uppy,
but I think we're winning!

175
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,328
[both] Yay!

176
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,498
Jimbo, Staci! Where are you?
It's the final fight!

177
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,293
- Got stuck in a mirror maze, sir.
- I'll ask this baby for directions.

178
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,378
[screams]

179
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,629
It was me again!

180
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,716
- Save me a shin kick.
- No promises. [gasps]

181
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,676
Peekaboo!

182
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,013
Let go of my brother, bathtub hands!
[grunts]

183
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,518
[belches]

184
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,979
[coughs] Ew! Gross little kid!

185
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,314
- Googah Kai!
- Whoa! [grunts]

186
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,111
I just did what I know.
Still quitting, read the letter.

187
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,448
Beebs, we rescued the CEO. We won!

188
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,074
Gimme the hero shot!

189
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:59,706
<i>Welcome to the future, Baby Corp.
It tastes like mashed victory. Yee-haw!</i>

190
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,458
[all] Yee-haw!

191
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,334
[clapping]

192
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,336
<i>There you have it, Baby Corp,</i>

193
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,841
<i>your new CEO,
a gigantic, ridiculous fool.</i>

194
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,384
Uh...

195
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,303
- Wha...?
- [Estes grunts]

196
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,933
Ma'am, you're working with the old people?

197
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,561
Working with old people? No.

198
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,272
[gasping]

199
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,527
No.

200
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,240
- [all scream]
<i>- I am old people.</i>

201
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,407
[spits] Eh?

202
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,286
Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

203
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:43,541
This whole time you've been
Turtleneck Superstar CE-Old Lady?

204
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,045
And she's my old lady!

205
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,963
Kissy, kissy!

206
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,718
[kissing, moaning]

207
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,805
[all retching]

208
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:04,395
We've been plotting this for years,
a simple two-part plan.

209
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:10,193
One, distract from the outside,
care of my sweet snoogle-mint Frederic.

210
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,402
[all screaming]

211
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,907
<i>Meanwhile, part two,
I sow chaos on the inside.</i>

212
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,327
If you solve the formula
for Stinkless Serum,

213
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,789
you get the job of CEO.

214
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,207
- [grunts]
- [teddy bear squeaks]

215
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,750
[screaming]

216
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,170
Bravo. You only made one mistake:

217
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,090
I did crack the formula
for Stinkless Serum,

218
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,760
a super weapon to change
the balance of love forever!

219
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,555
[both laughing]

220
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,892
Honestly, I expected more cowering.
Let me try it again.

221
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,769
- Stinkless Serum!
- Wait.

222
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,858
[sniffing] I recognize that one.
That's Tsunami Inferno,

223
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,442
our biggest failure!

224
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,444
It smells awful.

225
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,446
No, it... [screams]

226
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,573
Yes, it does!

227
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,200
Why would you lie about...
[gasps] Oh, no.

228
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,328
You never wanted us to re-crack
Stinkless Serum.

229
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,832
You were collecting
all the rotten, stinking failures.

230
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,542
Good baby.

231
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:12,589
<i>An arsenal of stink
to be unleashed on babykind.</i>

232
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,134
<i>What did you call it, Boss Baby?</i>

233
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:20,346
<i>A super weapon to change
the balance of love forever.</i>

234
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,349
[gasps] Every baby in town
is at this festival.

235
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,979
All we need is the perfect patsy
to deliver the stink...

236
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,607
little Timmy Templeton.

237
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,817
What? I don't work for you.

238
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,152
Do you?

239
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,822
[screams] Ragtime brainwashing!

240
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,367
- [playing ragtime tune]
- [whimpers, groans]

241
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,080
Let's play canasta!

242
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,125
Enjoy your End O' Summer Fest, Baby Corp.

243
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,336
You'll love the grand finale.

244
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,379
No!

245
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,967
[screaming, grunting]

246
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,635
One more charge.

247
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,305
We can crush these oldies.
Get up and fight!

248
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,557
- You're no CEO.
- What?

249
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,518
You did kind of win the job
in a fake contest.

250
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,646
So what? I'm a born leader!

251
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:14,025
- You played right into the enemy's hands!
- So did everybody else!

252
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,779
Then I guess nobody's our CEO. Ugh!

253
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,032
Looks like it's back to underground
"got your nose" fights for me.

254
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,575
You are the garbage baby.

255
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,994
- What do I do now?
- This is terrible!

256
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,705
- Talk about failure in leadership!
- No! Wait! Listen to me!

257
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,669
- Triplets!
- I'm not a tiger! [sobs]

258
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,462
Jimbo! Staci!

259
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,798
Sorry, boss, we're still stuck!

260
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,716
You're gonna be okay, Jimbo.

261
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,842
Thanks, Jimbo.

262
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,135
Hendershot.

263
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,430
You broke my camera, Beebs...

264
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,265
and my heart.

265
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,267
[sobbing]

266
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,644
[sighs]

267
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,356
Yee-haw.

268
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,320
[coughing] Oh, that's deep-fried! Ech!

269
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,616
Okay, Templeton, I'll bite.

270
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,161
Why quit the best job
any of us will ever have?

271
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,748
[Templeton's voice] <i>"Dear baby brother,
I'm happy you got the job you wanted,</i>

272
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,752
<i>but I'm not sure
you really even know how to be a boss."</i>

273
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:15,837
Junk mail.

274

286
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,500
He actually wrote that part down.

287
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,753
Tim! Timmy!

288
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,133
Tim! Timothy Templeton!

What did you do with my grandsons,
you monster?

00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,599
Easy! I'm on your side.

by a rogue band of elderly.</i>

Now, I know Frederic Estes is your friend.

295
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,483
Estes can suck a lime
if he's got my Timmy.

296
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,651
- No! [screaming]
- Where's Frederic, prune mouth?

I don't know, I swear! Please!
My bones are the texture of popcorn.

298
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,951
Keep questioning seniors.
We have to find Estes.

299
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,079
Oh, I'll find someone
who knows something

300
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,123
if I have to pry their dentures
out with a wrench.

301

Uh, what's a grandson? [chuckles]

305
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,347
I'd hate to see this hearing aid
run out of batteries.

No! I won't be able to hear gossip.

307
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,062
Oh, all right.
I don't know everything, but...

308
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,745
whatever they're planning with your boy,

309
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,776
it's gonna happen at the final high note.

310
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,486
Final high note?

311
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,905
The grand finale? Of course.

312
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,699
Look up here, everyone.

313
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,828
It's TV's Marsha Krinkle!

314
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,542
Hi. Okay, let's kick off the entertainment
with a warm welcome for our house band,

315
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,419
Cracklin' Bones O'Dell

[joints clicking]

319
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,723
I can't believe
we're finally playing a gig.

320
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:37,061
And with the Cracklin' Bones O'Dell!
I'm so starstruck.

321
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,771
[Marsha] And on guest vocals,

322
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:43,609
here to sing the international anthem
of old people,

323
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:48,531
which is apparently a thing,
Turtleneck Superstar Old Lady!

324
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,700
- [applause]
- [gasps]

325
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,744
Now, the oldies tell me
there's a special surprise

326
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,330
for our town's babies at the end,

327
00:15:56,414 --> 00:16:01,627
so be sure to gather up all those adorable
little bundles of... whatever.

328
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,880
[cooing, giggling]

329
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,676
No, no, no, no, no!

330
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,720
Mrs. Templeton, the final high note!

<i>- I know what it means!</i>
- [Goldfarb panting]

332
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,474
Talk to me.

333
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,810
We only have until the last note
of this song to find Tim.

334
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
What?

335
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,482
I need to know right now, can I trust you?

336
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,277
This is a grandson we're talking about.
I'd do anything for them.

337
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,696
- Even the baby?
<i>- Of course.</i>

338
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,115
He drives me half out of my skull
sometimes,

339
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,994
<i>- and I really don't get the suit and tie.</i>
- It's called respect for the workplace!

340
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,120
Sorry. Continue.

341
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,330
<i>But I'm his Gigi.</i>

342
