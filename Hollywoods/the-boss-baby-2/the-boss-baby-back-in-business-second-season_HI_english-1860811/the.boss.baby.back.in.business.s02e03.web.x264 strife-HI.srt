Our temporary roommate situation
is at crisis level.

There's been enough bloodshed.

17
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,516
Sorry about that, Templeton.
I got a little carried away.

18
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,019
- Our sacred brothership is strong.
- Rock solid.

19
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,938
And I think if we come up
with ground rules,

20
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,314
things can go even better.

21
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,858
I concur. A contract.

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,948
Rule number one:
When I work, I need a quiet, calm space.

23
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,491
A mouse fart should be alarming.

24
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,954
Second rule number one:
Don't touch my stuff.

25
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:23,208
That's actually the only one I need,
but it would be in really big letters.

26
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,668
We're agreed on terms.

27
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,129
So, how will these rules be enforced?

28
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,047
We'll figure that out as we go.

- Spit wad.

31
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,182
I believe there was a rule
about touching my stuff.

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,478
So I said,

- Shh.

36

Quiet work space.
[whispers] Mouse farts.

37
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,157
That was my rule! Ow! [growls]

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,618
How are you so precise
with these spit wads?

00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,498

- I got a little in my mouth.
- Oh, me too.

00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,777
I'm impressed you tried, Tim,

47
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,946
but I'm not sure you can reason
with a baby.

48
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,240
Maybe you can use the room
for the first half of the day

49
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,204
and let the baby play in there
in the afternoon.

50
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,620
Unacceptable. It's my room.

Did you try spit wads
like I've been training you?

53
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,460
Please don't teach him
to spit wad the baby.

54
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,254
Spit wads are a harmless,
long-range way

55
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,256
to keep a kid
on a straight and narrow path.

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,425
How do you think my Ted
turned out so sweet?

57

I'd soak him in the things.

- Finish your dinner.
- Yes, Mother.

61
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,687
Tim, I shared a room with six siblings,
all horrible.

62
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,524
Three of them just passed gas non-stop.
Drove me crazy.

63
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,901
So when spit wads didn't work,
you know what I did?

64
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,736
I got out in the neighborhood
and kept busy.

- I'm good.
- Uh, sorry?

You're starting a business
without my help?

Would you also do surgery
without a doctor,

91
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,008
or go into space without an astronaut?

92
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,719

A gentleman's wager, then.

99
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,612
You and Danny make, say, $20
by the time the streetlights come on.

100
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:43,575
Do that, you get exclusive daytime use
of our room for the summer.

101
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,995
If not, this place is mine.
And no more spit wads.

00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,123
- Twenty dollars before dark.
- The room is the prize.

103
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,627
And some time apart
is the cherry on top. Deal.

104
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,507
[chuckles] Feels nice to come
to an agreement with you,

What's going on?

120
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,754
I think they finally re-figured out how
to make Stinkless Serum.

121
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,840
They've done it?
Then Turtleneck's ready to step down.

I think it's affecting my brain. Brain.

Brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain.

128
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,323
You ever say a word so much,
it doesn't even sound like a word anymore?

Brain. [laughs]

130

142
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,704
[Danny] We sell pizzas,
but only the toppings.

143
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,374
No. Soda pop with just the bubbles.

144
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,711
Wait. The insides of hot dogs.

145
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,839
- I got it!
- Okay, but I got plenty more in the tank.

146
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,592
Look at these people
just walking around the neighborhood.

147
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,844
I bet they'd love to hire a taxi.

148
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,264
But a taxi won't go
from their porch to their mailbox.

149
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:15,310
That's where we come in.
We give the rides too short for taxis.

150
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,188
Yes!

151
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,732
We need a wagon and a chair.

152
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,694
- [gasps] What happened?
- Simmons.

153
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,864
Did she get the formula wrong?
Yes, colossally.

154
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,743
She's made herself
the stinkiest baby on the planet.

155
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,622
I can fix it. Just need brain.

156
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:39,125
Oh. Look how fast my eyes move.
Whoa, whoa. There it goes. Whoa.

157
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,711
No sleep for a week and bad serum.

158
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,840
Totally cuckoo and totally poo-poo.
[chuckles]

159
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,093
Rhymes. How amusing.

160
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,928
I see why music is so popular.

161
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,429
Solution, give me one.

162
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,265
She needs a dose
of original Stinkless Serum.

163
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,226
The vial's still safe. I can bring it in.

164
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,396
No. Spies everywhere.
Serum stays in the field.

165
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,772
Take her to it.

166
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,442
You want me to take her into the field?
Ma'am, that's a huge risk.

167
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,195
My job is making sure people love babies.

168
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,697
What happens when they smell a baby

169
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,074
that stinks like a wet dog
threw up a ham salad?

170
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,203
Solutions haunt us
like the ghosts of our failures.

171
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:20,583
A true innovator, a future CEO,
fears neither.

172
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,503
So fear is a bronco to be tamed?

173
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,424
You're talking nonsense.
It confuses and enrages me. Stop it.

174
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,093
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

175
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,471
[gasping]

176
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,140
You okay? We have work to do.

177
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,350
Too weak to move.

178
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,437
The smell, worse than Jimbo's diapers.

179
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,147
- [coughs]
- [retches]

180
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,900
Oh, no. I just threw up in my mask.

181
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,028
- [Staci groans, grunts]
- [sighs]

182
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,948
Right. Looks like it's just you and me,
loopy, sleep-deprived Simmons.

183
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,534
Oh, I have 13 toes.

184
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,287
[Tim] We're the Picker-Uppers.

185
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,290
We pick you up
so you'll never have to walk again.

186
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:06,004
No trip is too short.
Hop aboard our comfortable chair-agon.

187
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:10,091
- A wagon with a chair on top.
- But not just any chair.

188
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,845
The finest, most comfortable chair
I could find at the dump.

189
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,973
Did I hear you shouting
about giving rides?

190
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,851
[laughing]

191
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,312
Hey, this is kinda fun.

192
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,236
Ow. Ow! Ow.

193
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,572
[grunting] Ow!

194
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,574
My Teflon shinbone!

195
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,951
Sorry. We'll give you a discount.

196
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,622
A half-hour for a tow truck?

197
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,666
Ah! But all the good crimes
are happening now.

198
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,961
[imitates siren blaring]

199
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,963
Let's get that speeder, boys.

200
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,593
Just three dollars? We worked all morning.

201
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,262
Are you kidding? We did great.

202
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,972
That's at least two candy bars

203
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,433
and tons of change left
to throw at squirrels.

204
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,978
But I need to make $20
before the streetlights come on.

205
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,815
- How do we make more faster?
- I have an idea.

206
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,901
Quick, give me a quarter.
I see you, squirrel!

207
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,653
Eat two bits!

208
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,781
Think, Templeton. Gotta win this bet.

209
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,867
More passengers,
faster trips, higher fares.

210
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,246
Ugh. Missed him. But totally worth it
for the life experience.

211
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,457
We need to upgrade our vehicle.
Do you know anyone with a go-kart?

212
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,085
What? No.

213
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:31,464
Why would I know anyone with a...
what did you say? Glo-klart?

214
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,299
- [chuckles]
- Do you have a go-kart?

215
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,136
She's not ready for the road yet!

216
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,428
[sniffs]

217
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,472
Fine. Sheesh.

218
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,349
I hope you like fun.

219
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,435
Well, that's the smell contained at least.

220
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,729
If I go grab the serum,
you'll be good here?

221
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,608
Ooh. I've never been out
in the real world before.

222
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,902
I must see everything! [inhales]

223
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,572
Oh. The trees are calling to me.

224
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,366
Business is booming.
So fun being successful.

225
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,326
Just need to quickly grab a helmet.

226
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,162
- Here I come, trees!
- [gasps]

227
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,956
Templeton, were you born in a barn?

228
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,751
Hey, what's Simmons doing here?
And why is she in a ball thing?

229
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,421
Tell me, what's the worst smell
you've ever smelled?

230
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,839
- Dad's socks.
- Fine.

231
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,091
Now imagine those socks
pulled from the gut of a fish.

232
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,009
Ugh!

233
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,803
That's what Simmons smells like,
times a thousand.

234
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,222
If this thing cracks
and anyone smells her,

235
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,224
baby love may never recover.

236
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,269
But if I fix this,
I'm on the fast track to CEO.

237
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,240
I just need a sec.
Can you watch her for me?

238
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,190
I guess if you really need me to...

239
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,275
Wait.

240
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,652
Watch her until the streetlights
come on, right?

241
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,779
I get what you're trying, Sneaky Pete.

242
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,239
What are you talking about?

243
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,367
The wager we made this morning?
I don't even care about that anymore.

244
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,120
Sure. This is a prank, right?

245
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,749
Nothing is real. Not even my eyes.

246
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,793
Ha! I knew it. You almost had me.

247
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,962
- See ya.
- Templeton, wait! [sighs]

248
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,464
Stay put.

249
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,341
[Gigi] High noon. Time for lunch.

250
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,926
Gah! I forgot about Gigi!

251
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,594
Do not move!

252
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,099
No nap yet, mister. Lunchtime.

253
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,227
You're staying on Gigi's strict
character-building schedule.

254
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,982
Here I come, trees!

255
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,443
- [tires screech]
- [gasps]

256
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,696
That's so amazing!

257
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,199
Me and my dad built her
from parts we found at the dump.

258
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,242
She's my Thunder Dumpling.

259
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,369
Wow!

260
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,620
Even feels fast.

261
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,581
Half horsepower engine.
That's triple the power.

262
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,425
And with the backseat
and the wagon attached,

263
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,502
we've doubled our passenger load.

264
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,880
Watch out, neighborhood.
You're about to get picked up.

265
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,882
Let's be successful.

266
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,217
Yeah!

267
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,385
This baby's touchy.

268
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,846
You gotta punch this
and pull that and twist this,

269
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,723
and then a slap on the dash.

270
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,813
- How do you make it go faster?
- Engage thunder pedal.

271
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,565
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

272
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,779
Wow. Love to see that initiative.

273
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,908
[grunting, sighs]

274
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,619
Come on, tummy. We can do this.

275
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,038
Gotta get back to Simmons
before she bolts.

276
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,209
Timmy! Lunchtime!

277
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,173
[coos]

278
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,842
I'm gonna make a sandwich for Tim.

279
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,302
- Be with you in a minute.
- [giggling]

280
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,930
- [ball thuds]
- [Simmons giggling]

281
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,516
Gah! [gasps, cries]

282
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,144
I hear ya. Nap time it is.

283
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,355
But you're waking up in two hours
on the dot.

284
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,234
No, no, no, no, no!

285
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,200
Serum, serum, serum, serum.
[gasps] There you are.

286
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,414
Hire the Picker-Uppers!

287
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,708
Feel the raw power of Thunder Dumpling.

288
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,170
A registered subsidiary
of Super Cool Big Kids Incorporated.

289
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,923
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
- What is it?

290
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,011
I got a way to billionaire supercharge
our business. Watch.

291
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,845
Hi, Mr. Willis.

292
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,390
How's the garage sale going?
Where are your customers?

293
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,977
Well, I don't know, Tim.
Maybe I didn't put up enough signs.

294
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,984
You know, Danny and I
have a neighborhood taxi business.

295
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,237
We can drive around,
spread the word about your garage sale,

296
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,198
and give customers rides here.

297
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,281
Sold.

298
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,245
You didn't buy anything?
I'm eyeing one of those spatulas.

299
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,833
He's paying us to bring him customers,
who will pay us to bring them to him.

300
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:40,755
By the time the streetlights come on,
you'll be buying every spatula in town.

301
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,424
[giggles]
It's like you're reading my dream journal.

302
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,473
Simmons? Simmons?

303
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,767
Where are you?

304
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,061
[panting] Trees, sidewalks.

305
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,147
[grunts] I love outside!

306
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,529
I don't know if you heard,
but Mr. Willis is having a garage sale.

307
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,408
- [gasps]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! [grunts]

308
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:13,329
Oh, a small fellow. I wanna pet you.

309
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,331
How do I open it? Aha!

310
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,212
No! Don't let them smell you!

311
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,173
[sniffs] Ah! [retching]

312
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,052
What's your name, huh?

313
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,637
[sniffs] Ah!

314
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,097
What's that smell?

315
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,932
Fried throw-up and onions?

316
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,601
Hi, Mr. Fried Throw-Up and Onions.

317
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,856
I'm R&D Baby Simmons. Very tired brain.

318
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,900
Who wants to watch me run? I do!

319
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,152
[panting, laughing]

320
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,779
No! Simmons, you stop right there!

321
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,201
[coins clinking]

322
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,288
So many customers. Golly!

323
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,206
Think you can find more
where they came from?

324
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,960
[laughing]

325
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,296
[gasps] Ha! Whoa! Ha, ha!

326
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,340
Ah! [retches, coughs]

327
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,510
That smell... [coughs]

328
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,596
Hard to breathe.

329
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,473
Goodbye, baby love.

330
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,933
It was nice knowing you.

331
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,351
[Staci] We got her, BB.

332
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,021
Reinforcements! Ha, ha! I love my team.

333
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,939
Oh, wait. Wait. Your masks!

334
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,608
[Jimbo laughs, gasps]

335
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,568
Clam farts! [grunts]

336
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,113
Diarrhea sushi! [grunts]

337
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,116
Oh, fart poop duty.

338
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,161
Whoa! [grunts]

339
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,747
Just a couple more cartloads,
and we'll make our goal.

340
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,249
Stop at Mrs. Dingle's.
She loves a good bargain.

341
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,333
Sure thing.

342
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
- Huh.
- What?

343
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,087
[Danny] Brakes don't work.

344
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,506
- What?

345
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,466
Thunder Dumpling
wasn't ready for the road.

346
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,010
What are we gonna do?
Find a safe place to crash.

347
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,429
I'm not crashing this beautiful machine.

348
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,806
We'll just have to drive
until we're out of gas.

349
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,769
Huh. Funny. Nothing's happening.

350
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,063
What do you mean nothing's happening?

351
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,066
Good news. Something happened.

352
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,152
We're about to go down the steepest hill
in the neighborhood.

353
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,570
Hill Street?

354
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:13,032
Yeah, and it leads down
to the busiest street in town.

355
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,450
Busy Street?

356
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,452
What? No. Main Street.

357
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,538
We'll be crushed! Let's bail.

358
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,540
I'm not bailing on Thunder Dumpling.

359
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,875
It's our lives or your Thunder Dumpling.

360
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,712
If you don't care about Dumpling,
you jump. I'm staying.

361

- I'm not going without you.

Out of gas. Boy, we really lucked out.

369

I almost died and peed.

Psst! Templeton.

[sighs] I need to take a walk.

00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,085
Cool. I'll see if I can fix Dumpling.

373

- Ah!
- This Simmons thing, it's real.

374
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,926
She's out of the bubble, and she stinks.

375
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,012
You stink at lying.

376
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,974
You know what's actually real?
I'm this close to winning our bet.

377
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,685
Room, room. Room, room, room,
room, room, room, room!

378
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,187
- How much have you made so far?
- Around $15.

379
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,522
Already?

380
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,692
Let me hire you.
Five dollars to help me catch Simmons.

381
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,360
- What?
- That gets you to 20.

382
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,987
You win the bet, you get the room.

383
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,698
I thought we were spending time apart,
to save our brothership?

384
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,034
I need your help. You need my help.

385
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,120
What's a brothership good for
if we can't come together in a crisis?

[Danny retches, coughs]

387
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:49,754
Why does this baby smell like a skunk
who eats other skunks' butts?

388
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,173
Oh, it's so sick.

It's like dog poop learned how
to poop other poop.

I told you I wasn't lying, this time.

394
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,019
She slowed down, but she's making her way
to that garage sale

395
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,270
at the bottom of the hill.

396
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,481
How are there so many people
at a garage sale?

397
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,692
'Cause I'm a great, boom, businessman.

398
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,487
I'm impressed,
but that crowd only makes this worse.

399
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,782
If they get a whiff of stinky Simmons,
baby love might never recover.

400
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,451
Forget the CEO job. My career is over.

401
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,205
- Can we take the go-kart?
- I mean, it's totally broken, but...

402

The plan again?

403
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,504
Can't steer or stop.
We need a perfect glide.

404
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,422
If she still stinks, we'll faint.

405
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,883
Then it's all up
to your disgusting talent.

406
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,970
One shot, one chance.
It's stinkless or get stunk.

407
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,765
Trust me.
I can spit wad anything that moves.

408

- Yeah!

In you, I see our future.

Simmons! How's my rock star change agent?

That was CEO-quality risk-taking.

In you, I see our future.

432
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,261
Uh, I thought I was being groomed
to be the next CEO.

433
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,805
Of course you are. As is everyone else.

434

Eating a carrot kills hunger,
but chasing a carrot births innovation.

Cutthroat. I like it.

And I had to pay Mr. Willis our profits.
We just have a few cents left.

I'm really sorry.

442

Maybe you and I aren't meant
to be business partners.

Oh, forget the bet.

You made more money in a half-day
than I thought you could in a week.

You helped me with Simmons
and saved my career.

Certainly, we can figure out
how to share this room.

And away we go!
Fend off the dinosaurs!
