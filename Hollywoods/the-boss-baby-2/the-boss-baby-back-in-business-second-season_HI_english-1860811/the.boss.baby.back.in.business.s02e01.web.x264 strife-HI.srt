I like having my own place
for my own private stuff.

173
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,482
You don't like the color?

174
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,444
I mean, that's literally
all the serum we have.

175
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,778
One vial.

176
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,530
<i>We cracked the formula by accident,</i>

177
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,825
<i>or as I call it,
"coincidental innovation."</i>

178
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,535
[coughs]

179
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,661
[sniffs]

180
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,414
Simmons, how long
were you wearing this diaper?

181
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,957
Um, two weeks.

182
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,544
Success! [chuckles]
Show me the chemical formula.

183
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,255
I was drawing choo-choos.

184
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,758
[Turtleneck Superstar]
R&D babies, very smart,

185
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,510
but still babies.
Not great at taking notes.

186
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,762
Spectacular trains, though.

187
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,305
Can we re-crack the formula?

188
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,849
- Uh...
- Undoubtedly. When? Mystery.

189
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,310
So, until then,
this vial isn't safe here.

190
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,480
If word gets out,
all our enemies will be coming after it.

191
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,732
And if Bootsy Calico could break in here...

192
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,816
Anyone could.

193
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,695
Spies everywhere.
We need the serum off-site.

194
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,157
With you, man in the field.
Can you keep it safe?

195
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,743
- I can find a place...
- La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

196
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,705
Tell no one. Not me, no.
I don't want to know.

197
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,792
Secure, secret. Field-team babies only.

198
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,086
Absolutely. And Tim, of course.

199
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,172
Your brother? Not a baby.
He stays out the loop.

200
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,216
Ma'am, I trust Templeton implicit...

201
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,759
Can we talk about the future?

202
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,136
Uh, I believe you said it's a rocket ship.

203
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,765
I have one job as CEO:
deliver Stinkless Serum.

204
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,519
Legacy, done. After that, I have
no interest in running this company.

205
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,522
- Which means...
- We'll need a new CEO?

206
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,111
Maybe even a certain VP
of field operations,

207
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,029
if he can really show me something.

208
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,616
I still don't feel comfortable
leaving my brother out...

209
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,410
Don't answer with your mouth.
Answer with your future.

210
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,389
[Tim's voice] <i>We're still brothers.</i>

211
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,166
<i>Just maybe we don't have to share
everything.</i>

212
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,583
I'm in.

213
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,756
Hold it tight, Boss Baby.
The future is now in your hands.

214
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,593
- Where you gonna hide it, boss?
- I don't know yet.

215
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,137
We need this out of sight, ASAP.

216
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,722
The longer it's in the open,
the more dangerous for all of us.

217
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,015
Spies everywhere.

218
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,475
When I was in daycare,

219
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,770
we used to take field trips
to this abandoned missile silo,

220
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,274
and I know for a fact
you can lose a whole person in there.

221
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,610
Ha! Try to take my blankie, Brayden.

222
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,612
- No missile silos.
- [groans]

223
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,114
[Tim and Gigi laughing]

224
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,448
Incoming. Scatter!

225
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,038
[gasps] Oh, right, roommates.

226
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,374
- You wanna still play here or... ow!
- [thuds]

227
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,420
This is my room. What is wrong with you?

228
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,380
Not everyone's as sweet as you, Timmy.

229
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,258
You gotta be firm with the pushy ones.
Push right back.

230
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:20,013
If he doesn't wanna hang out with us,
maybe he could play downstairs.

231
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,140
[whines]

232
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,726
- [Gigi] Nope.
- [Boss Baby gasps]

233
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,729
Who's the boss now, kid? Boom. Gigi.

234
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,524
So, Timmy, I lost a pill box
in my purse last week.

235
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,151
Can you find it for me?

236
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,321
Yes! Gigi purse-diving. Watch this, baby.

237
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,616
[inhales, exhales]

238
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,629
Got it.

239
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,547
I don't know how you do it!

240
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,091
I can never find anything in that purse.

241
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:01,262
Well, I'll be. It's full of gummy duckies.
Quack, quack.

242
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,430
Thanks, Gigi.

243
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,973
[munching]

244
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,892
We should hang out all afternoon.

245
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,225
[groans]

246
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,355
- [both chuckling]
- Yeah!

247
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,983
When the tornado hit, it lifted
the entire dump truck into the air.

248
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,777
We flew across three states.

249
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,528
[Tim] This one's for reptile rescue.

250
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,948
And this one's for putting stickers neatly
on my helmet.

251
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,619
[both laughing]

252
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,790
"Though the world can be scary
and life sometimes seems unfair-y,

253
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,543
you can sleep the whole night through.
I'll always be watching you."

254
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,171
Creepy.

255
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,223
That was fun, right? Gigi is so great.

256
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,558
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. Go back to sleep.

257
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,268
- What's in your hand?
- Not important.

258
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,271
- Sleep. Back to it. Go.
- Come on, what's going on?

259
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,524
Don't worry, Templeton.
We're still brothers.

260
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,944
Just maybe we don't have
to share <i>everything.</i>

261
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,572
Hey, you can't use my words on me.
Those are my words.

262
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,575
[Mom] Tim, sweetheart,
it's time to go to sleep!

263
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,495
[Gigi] Challenge authority, Timmy!
Don't let the man keep you down!

264
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,415
- [Dad] Mom!
- [Mom] Nobody comes out of that room!

265
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,375
Sorry. I just wanted to help.

266
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,006
You wanna help?
Tell me you're not a snorer.

267
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,967
How would I know?
I don't share a room with myself.

268
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,428
Swell. Oh, that's lumpy.

269
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,849
[yawns]

270
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,185
Thanks for keeping the snoring down,
Templeton. Huh?

271
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:32,895
Oh, no.

272
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,772
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

273
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,151
Staci, Jimbo, get over here now!
We've got a problem.

274
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,236
[Staci] We're still under the bed, sir.

275
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:45,199
Anyone could've taken it.
Guinea pig assassins, ninja puppies.

276
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,325
Horse pirates.

277
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,244
Miniature horse pirates!

278
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,038
[gasps] Aw!

279
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,581
- [door closes]
- [shushing]

280
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,417
Is this about that thing
under your pillow?

281
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,421
- He took it! Death to traitors!
- [screams]

282
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,756
She's so sharp!

283
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,924
Staci, calm down. Breathe.

284
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,887
Nobody said Templeton
actually took the vial.

285
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,805
Oh. I did.

286
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,059
- [chuckles] Do you know what you've done?
- [yells]

287
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,853
You've ruined Baby Corp. You've ruined me!

288
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,814
Stop shaking me!
I just ate a very milky breakfast!

289
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,028
I didn't steal your whatever it is.
I just hid it better.

290
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,237
Go on.

291
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,490
Never hide anything under your pillow.

292
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,867
If the tooth fairy doesn't get it,
Mom and Dad will.

293
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,869
I once hid a caramel apple under there

294
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,272
- after Halloween...
- Skip ahead.

295
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,332
I know the roommate thing is weird,
but I'm not gonna let you get busted.

296
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,960
What's the point of being brothers
if we can't totally trust each other?

297
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,175
So do you trust me enough to tell me
what's in that vial?

298
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,885
Absolutely.

299
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,764
If you trust me enough to show me
what's in your secret dinosaur drawer.

300
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,558
It's private. None of your business.
You didn't look, right?

301
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,354
Fine, we don't have to share everything.

302
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,648
So, where's my vial?

303
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:04,028
In the one place Mom and Dad
would never dare to look. Gigi's purse.

304
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,532
The serum is in Gigi's purse?
Gigi, our grandmother?

305
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,035
It's perfect. Not even Gigi
can find anything in that purse.

306
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,204
It's like a portal to another dimension.

307
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,499
You put something in there,
it's never coming out.

308
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,126
Unless I get it out.

309
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,673
<i>I've been diving for Gigi's lost stuff
in that purse for the past seven years.</i>

310
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,800
<i>I'm the only one who can crack the code.</i>

311
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,720
- Then crack out my vial and give it back!
- Okay. She's up in the kitchen.

312
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,853
"Hi, Timmy.
A nice elderly gentleman invited me

313
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,480
to check out the local senior center.
Back by lunch.

314
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,984
Give yourself a hug for me, kiddo.
Your brother can stay in his crib."

315
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,111
She is a terrible grandparent.

316
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,530
- Senior center, let's go.
- No.

317
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,117
I can't go into that place! Do you know
what they do to babies in there?

318
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,368
[whimpering]

319
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,744
Whoa, Jimbo.

320
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,331
- It's just elderly people. They're nice.
- Then go get my vial!

321
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,251
You don't think that'd be suspicious?
"Hey, Gigi, just came by

322
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,879
to watch the square dancing.
Can I have your purse?"

323
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,840
I need that vial, Templeton.
My future's in there.

324
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,886
If our being brothers means anything,
you will find a way to fix this.

325
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,139
Okay. If I can't get into that purse,
you are.

326
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,807
I'm sorry, come again?

327
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,102
Welcome to the art of purse diving.

328
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,479
Your training begins...

329
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,814
now.

330
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:22,898
- Shut your eyes.
- Ah!

331
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,735
Find the pretzel. You have ten seconds.

332
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,195
Jimbo, count for me.

333
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,529
One...

334
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,866
Staci, count for me.

335
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,367
Ten, nine...

336
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,578
Okay. Thirteen-inches wide.

337
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,497
- Canvas, maybe faux leather.
- Time's up!

338
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,123
