Well, this day's been a waste.

What fun is being vice president
of field operations

18
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,188
when I can't go out into the field?

00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,568

I'm safe, I'm safe, I'm safe...

Templeton!

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,198
He can't get me. I'm safe in here.
I'm safe...

24
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,033
I'm good, I'm fine. Not scared.

00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,370
I never said you were.

27
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,613
My hands are cold.
I do pretend bongos to warm them up,

28
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,792
and the bongos make me brave...
[hyperventilating]

29
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,880
Sure they do, sport.
Let's just slip these on here.

30
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,383
Better?

31
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,593
- [thunder cracks]
- Ah!

32
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,095
Yes?

33
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,889
Never take a job in sales or gambling.

34
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,033
- [thunder cracks]
- [both] Ah!

35
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,184
- Oh, great. It's contagious.
- [phone rings]

36
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,686
- [Gigi] Hello.
- It's Dad!

37
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,732
Oh, hi, sweetie.
How's your big-boy office job? What the...?

38
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,191
Why aren't you coming home yet?

39
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,568
Oh, hey, Tim.

40
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,613
Well, the storm flooded the bridge
back into town,

41
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,198
so we may not be back
until tomorrow morning.

42
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,201
Tomorrow morning? As in tomorrow?

43
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,663
But don't you worry, big guy.
You've got Gigi there.

44
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,208
And we're fine here.
Office is a little waterlogged, but...

45
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,292
[Mom] Great news.

46
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,172
I found some blue cheese dressing
and deli ham that wasn't underwater yet.

47
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,298
Ooh, la, la.

48
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,008
"Le cuisine française."

49
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,010
Gotta go. Be good. Bye, Tim.

50
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:15,927
Love you, Tim.

51
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,638
- <i>Kiss the baby.</i>
- Not happening.

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,932
Ted, is that my coffee mug?

53
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,728
Your dad and mom stuck at the office?

54
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,563
Then I'd better go prepare.

55
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,858
We don't have much time.
The worst of this is yet to come.

56
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,113
The worst? Are we getting tornadoes?
Hail? [gasps]

57
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,491
- Hail-nadoes?
- Don't joke.

58
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,077
A storm this bad means...

59
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,620
he's coming.

60
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,373
Who? Thunderstorm Santa?

61
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,833
Worse. The Frodarg.

62
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,377
Not a real word. Try again.

63
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,129
The Hartman Bog Frodarg.

64
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,589
[thunder cracking]

65
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,551
When the summer storms roll in,
he awakens.

[grunts]

69
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,101
The head of a giant bullfrog...

70
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,102
[gasps]

71
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,021
...with two glowing red eyes.

72
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,525
Only two eyes?
Pretty lame for a monster, if you ask me.

73
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,608
- Get down!
- [grunts]

74
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,070
- [Tim] The body of a dinosaur.
- [snarling]

75
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,489
The spines of a dinosaur.

76
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,575
The razor-sharp claws of a tiger.

77
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,869
Why not the claws of a dinosaur?

78
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,914
[scoffs] 'Cause then he'd just be
a dinosaur with a frog face.

79
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,958
Ooh, don't forget the two eyes.

80
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,336
You won't be joking so much
if the Frodarg is hungry, or...

81
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,965
- [screaming]
- [snarling]

82
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,299
- [Tim snarls]
- [screaming]

83
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,759
I am hungry...

84
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,803
- for babies.
- Templeton!

85
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,513
I just had a three-milk dinner.

86
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,224
Does your make-believe monster
wanna get vomited on?

87
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,684
He's not make-believe.

88
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,270
Everyone in town knows about the Frodarg,

89
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,356
but few have seen him
and lived to tell the tale.

90
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,482
How convenient.

91
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,774
[thunder rumbling]

92
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,197
- [thunder cracks]
- [screaming]

93
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,283
- [panting]
- [knock on door]

94
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,244
I'm no expert in urban legends,

95
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,122
but I'm pretty sure the Frodarg
is totally not real.

96
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,247
Like, at all.

97
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,833
Yeah, well, a year ago,

98
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,211
I was pretty sure that babies
totally didn't talk or run corporations.

99
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,131
- Like, at all. But here we are.
- Touché.

100
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,382
- [thunder cracks]
- Ah!

101
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,426
- [panting]
- [fingers drumming]

102
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,597
You'll be okay.
This storm's like a bear market.

103
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,804
We're all gonna take it in the shorts
for a while, but it can't last forever.

104
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,478
I didn't understand any of that,
but it helps that you're trying.

105
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,772
- Whatever you need.
- Now help me barricade the door

106
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,858
so the Frodarg can't claw through
and drink our brains like milkshakes.

107
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,701
- [baby monitor chimes]
- Sorry, that's work.

108
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,613
If you need further emotional support,
though, maybe try Gigi.

109
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,948
But I don't wanna leave you here
with the Frodarg.

110
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,117
I am confident that's not a problem.

111
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,953
Gigi, I'm scared!

112
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,121
Go for Boss Baby.

113
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,751
<i>Good. You've got your crisis face.
We need that.</i>

114
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,921
- Why? Do we have a crisis?
- <i>Don't you see my crisis face?</i>

115
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,216
Yes?

116
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,052
<i>Someone knows about Stinkless Serum.</i>

117
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,470
What? Which someone?

118
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,223
<i>A dog someone. Puppy Co.</i>

119
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,434
Oh. You know what?
I can totally see your crisis face now.

120
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,019
Wait! Did you say Puppy Co.?

121
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,395
[thunder cracks]

122
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,233
The Frodarg? Oh, Timmy, come here.

123
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,945
I promise,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

124
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,030
Okay.

125
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,701
Because I'm not letting that swamp demon
set one scaly foot in this house!

126
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,079
Eat somebody else's family, Frodarg!

127
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,582
[grunting]

128
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,463
<i>Without human leadership,
Puppy Co. has gone to the dogs.</i>

129
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,590
<i>Pun intended. You may giggle.</i>

130
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,842
[forced giggling]

131
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,135
<i>End giggles now.</i>

132
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,929
An all-puppy organization.

133
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,765
Pure, fluffy, cuddly evil.

134
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,225
I'll secure the serum, ma'am.

135
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,019
I'm not playing fetch
with our company's future.

136
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,731
<i>Pun returned. Mine was better.
Now, clarification.</i>

137
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:02,028
<i>Intel says Puppy Co.'s best agent
en route, Bug, dispatched. Thoughts?</i>

138
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,281
Did you say... Bug?

139
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,784
<i>Tech... failing. Explain your concern.</i>

140
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,746
It can't be <i>the</i> Bug. He doesn't exist.
He's just a legend.

141
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,874
<i>Can't hear... Situation is critical.</i>

142
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,710
<i>He's coming. Be ready.</i>

143
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,304
He's real, right? Totally real.
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

144
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,598
Saw the beast myself
when I was just a little girl.

145
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,681
[shudders]

146
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,393
Hideous. I mean the creature was, not me.

147
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,020
I was stinking adorable.

148
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,106
And you know how much the Frodarg
likes eating cute little children.

149
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,189
[whimpers]

150
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,735
But don't you be afraid.
You're gonna be fine.

151
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,695
As long as you follow the rules
of the Frodarg.

152
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,867
What are the rules?
Hurry up and tell me the...!

153
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,950
One, never take a shower.

154
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,745
The more you smell like a swamp,
the less you'll smell like dinner.

155
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,204
No bath. Way ahead of you.

156
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,998
Two, keep raw liver handy.

157
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,584
Liver to the Frodarg
is like garlic to a vampire.

158
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,920
I always keep some in the cooler
for nights like this.

159
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:00,879
Liver means we live.

160
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,798
And three, never turn out the lights.

161
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,383
It can only see in the dark.

162
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,177
I don't care if we blind the neighbors

163
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,060
and bankrupt your parents
with the power bill.

164
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:13,516
If we're going to survive this night,
you turn on all the lights.

165
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,976
Every single one. Got it.

166
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,065
Mm! [sniffs]

167
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,567
"Fresh Springtime Meadow."
No baby or serum smells here.

168
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,318
Ah!

169
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,322
Help me protect the house.
We've gotta lock the place down.

170
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,950
Good call. We can't let him get in.

171
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,118
- Wait, what are you doing?
- [spray hissing]

172
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,663
Deodorizing the place
to throw him off the scent.

173
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,581
Ooh! Your no-tears shampoo.

174
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,985
Smear that ocean breeze smell
on the windows and doorknobs.

175
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,212
No, we can't make the room
smell like nice and clean me.

176
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,255
That's exactly what the Frodarg likes.

177
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,385
Frodarg? You're chasing nickels
around a $10 bill, Templeton.

178
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,095
We've got real problems now.

179
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,599
Bigger than a tiger-clawed dino-frog
that slurps brain milkshakes?

180
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,600
Way bigger.

181
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,687
Puppy Co. knows about the serum,
and they've sent the best.

182
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,981
Bug the Pug.

183
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,026
A pug? Those little squishy-faced dogs

184
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,028
that look happy and sad at the same time?

185
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,905
Do not take Bug the Pug lightly!

186
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,616
That dog is the stuff of corporate legend.

187
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,953
<i>He's like a ninja, and a wolf,
and a werewolf samurai ninja,</i>

188
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,289
<i>all wrapped up in a muscly,
squirmy pug body.</i>

189
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,043
<i>He attacks without warning
and disappears just as quickly.</i>

190
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,628
- [grunts]
- [whimpers]

191
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,297
- I never clocked out!
- Ah!

192
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,842
[Boss Baby] <i>Nothing is safe
from his slobbery jaws.</i>

193
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,094
- [panting, whimpering]
- [snarling]

194
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,639
[Boss Baby] <i>And you never see him coming.</i>

195
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,474
Ah!

196
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,771
If Bug the Pug is after the serum,
he'll stop at nothing to get it.

197
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,065
- [jingle plays]
- [lid whirs]

198
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,528
He'll destroy this entire house
and whoever gets in his way.

199
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,654
We are not safe.

200
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,823
So Gigi gave me some rules
to stop the Frodarg.

201
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,200
- There is no Frodarg!
- Dogs aren't spies!

202
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,953
Raw liver. Bog monsters hate it.

203
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,371
And dogs love it.

204
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,498
Now's not the time to argue.

205
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,542
No matter what's coming,
which is the Frodarg,

206
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,879
it's up to us to protect the house.
Let's be logical.

207
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,299
You're right. We need real backup
for my real, actual threat.

208
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,550
I'm calling Staci and Jimbo.

209
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,011
What? And set up a baby buffet?

210
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,806
Why not put out a sign?
"All Frodarg can eat!" [grunts]

211
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,851
- Let go!
- Never!

212
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,895
[panting, snuffling]

213
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,782
[panting]

214
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,044
[banging continues]

215
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,339
[barking]

216
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,382
[both grunting]

217
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,677
[baby monitor chiming]

218
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,389
<i>What's up, sir?
Oh! Brother battle to the death, huh?</i>

219
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,642
<i>I always knew this day would come.</i>

220
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,395
<i>If Tim wins, I promise to hunt him down
in your honor, sir.</i>

221
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,147
<i>And if you win,</i>

222
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:10,235
<i>I know a guy from daycare with some
swampland on the Eastern seaboard.</i>

223
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,445
No, Staci. We're both fine.

224
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,655
I'm not. [muffled grunt]

225
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,117
But we do have a crisis.
Puppy Co. knows about Stinkless Serum.

226
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,868
They've sent the best.

227
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,829
<i>- The who?</i>
- Bug the Pug.

228
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,622
<i>Breaking up, sir.</i>

229
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,376
<i>Did you just say Bug the...</i>

230
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,253
Staci?

231
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,380
- [distorted snarling]
- Ah!

232
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,506
[Staci] <i>...Pug?</i>

233
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,924
- The pug is here!
- The Frodarg.

234
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,216
<i>Boss!</i>

235
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,677
[snarling continues]

236
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,345
I think it's inside the house.

237
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,055
Or maybe it's just the wind.

238
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,931
Will you cut it out?

239
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,642
There are no monsters, period.

240
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,562
Except sometimes Gigi.
But old age will defeat her.

241
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,106
Still, you were right. We shouldn't fight.

242
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,860
Whatever's in here, which is Bug the Pug,
we must protect the house.

243
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,445
Yes, we should be ready
for either scenario.

244
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,406
Especially the real one,
which is the Frodarg.

245
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,241
I'll build a trap to lure in the Frodarg.

246
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,909
And I'll make one for the pug.

247
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,662
[horn toots]

248
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,177
I'm no longer afraid of you, Frodarg.

249
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,930
Come get your severance package,

250
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,682
Bug the Pug.

251
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,767
- [thunder cracks]
- [both screaming]

252
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,687
- We got this.
- Totally.

253
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,480
[panting]

254
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,660
[electricity crackles]

255
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,547
- [thunder cracks]
- [shouting]

256
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,900
- [Tim] Sorry.
- [Boss Baby] Shh.

257
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,842
- Do you hear something?
- [Tim] I can't tell.

258
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,677
We should creep around and investigate.

259
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,961
[Boss Baby] Sounds reasonable.

260
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,679
[both screaming]

261
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,807
- Where am I? What is this in my hand?
- [Tim] Soap!

262
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,351
Ew! I'm clean now!

263
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,770
Hands off my grandson, Frodarg!

264
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,480
Or grandsons.

265
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,275
Both of them. I'm just saying,
if you have to pick... Never mind.

266
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,111
- Everyone okay?
- No. Can we call Mom and Dad?

267
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,864
Oh, Timmy, I'm sorry,
the phones are dead.

268
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,410
Listen. I'm gonna check
the circuit breakers in the basement.

269
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,787
I'm sure we just blew a fuse.

270
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,250
But if not, and the Frodarg gets me,
you avenge my death in blood.

271
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,128
No mercy. It's the Templeton way.

272
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,006
Sure. Um... Can I come, too?

273
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,173
I should come.

274
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,760
That's my man of the house.
Grab your brother.

275
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,346
I think he wants to stay.

276
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,016
Alone in the dark?

277
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,269
We've got liver in our fort.
It's the safest place in the house.

278
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,313
Guess it'll build character. Let's go.

279
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,111
[panting] Please be the Frodarg,

280
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,071
please be the Frodarg,
please be the Frodarg.

281
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,843
[stairs creaking]

282
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,929
- [rustling]
- [panting]

283
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,140
[Gigi] We are not alone.

284
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,891
[snarling]

285
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,645
Gigi. Look.

286
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,980
[rattling]

287
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,816
- [snarls]
- [Tim gasps]

288
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,529
It's... it.

289
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,158
Don't run. Fear only makes it hungrier.

290
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,161
Come and get me,
you frog-headed abomination!

291
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,455
Ah!

292
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,538
It came and got me!

293
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,291
[Tim screams]

294
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,292
Frodarg!

295
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,544
Run, Timmy! Save yourself and the baby!

296
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,881
- [screaming, grunts]
- [panting]

297
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,844
[panting, whimpering]

298
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,763
- [door rattling]
- [Gigi] It's locked!

299
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,515
I'm gonna get the lights back on!
Find a place to hide!

300
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,810
[gasps]

301
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,271
Identify yourself!

302
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,440
It's me. I saw it. I saw the Frodarg.

303
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,399
It got Gigi.

304
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,483
Impossible.

305
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,944
It jumped her in the basement.
We've got to go save her.

306
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,795
Think, Templeton, because we need to know
how to fight this thing.

307
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,867
Did you see a bog monster
or a nasty smoosh-faced mutt?

308
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,870
It's... I honestly don't know anymore.

309
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,206
Gah. If it's Bug, he's coming up here
for the serum.

310
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,289
I have to protect it.

311
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,585
If it's Frodarg, I have to go down there
to save Gigi from it.

312
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,230
Just give me two seconds to freak out.

313
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,800
[screams, pants]

314
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,883
Go time.

315
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,804
Templeton, wait.
I know there's no Frodarg,

316
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,182
but, just in case,
you might wanna dress for the occasion.

317
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,853
How do I look?

318
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,359
- Like a marshmallow that's going to war.
- Is that good?

319
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,986
Depends on how much
that thing down there likes marshmallows.

320
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,280
Oh, man, that liver smells terrible.

321
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,408
Ooh, yeah. Don't bring it back.

322
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,992
[panting]

323
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,665
[snarling]

324
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,082
[gasps]

325
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,423
I know you're there. Sh... Show yourself.

326
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,259
[gasps]

327
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,178
[exhales]

328
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,597
Hey, I think he left.

329
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,436
- [gasps]
- Ah!

330
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,187
Ah! Frodarg!

331
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,357
- [Tim] Ah!
- It's real! I'm coming, Templeton!

332
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,275
[Tim grunting]

333
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,193
Leave him alone, you... Eh?

334
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,987
[both grunting]

335
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,238
Uh...

336
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,659
- Monster!
- Ah! Danny?

337
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,453
[coos]

338
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,620
You scared me.

339
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,623
You scared me.
What the heck are you doing here?

340
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,083
The rain flooded our basement,

341
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,419
and my dad and his girlfriend
are barreling it out.

342
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,380
Plus, it drove
all the cockroaches upstairs,

343
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,049
and they took over the kitchen.
So that's a whole thing.

344
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,302
I mean, why'd you scare me?

345
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,511
[chuckles]

346
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,681
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Forgot I was dressed like a Frodarg.

347
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,476
Didn't want the real Frodarg
to come after me.

348
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,438
I also haven't taken a bath in a week.
Pretty crafty, huh?

349
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,773
- [coos]
- But it's only been raining for a day.

350
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:23,857
Never mind.

351
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,653
Danny, listen.
The Frodarg might be in the house.

352
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,031
[chuckles] No way. You see him?

353
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,743
I stared right into those two red eyes.

354
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,786
[chuckles, gasps]

355
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,831
Man, if we could catch
a real-life Frodarg,

356
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,084
we'd be millionaires.
We could get on the news.

360
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,468
Quick. You got any liver?

361
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,430
Then let's bag us a 'Darg.

362
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,271
- Thanks for coming to save me.
- Night's not over yet. Faster!

363

364
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,610

[Tim] No way.

368
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,161
It's Bug the Pug?

369
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,120
[laughing]

370
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,914
He looks hilarious.

371

[whispers] Stinkless Serum!

374
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,506
Let's grab him before he wrecks
the whole house.

375
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,966
[whimpers] Nuh-uh.

376
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,217
No way, man.

377
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,178
Stop waving your arms.
He thinks you wanna play.

378
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,138
Why is he wearing goggles, Tim?

379
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,016
Only dogs with unclean souls wear goggles.

380
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,019
How are you more scared of a Not-Frodarg?

381
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,854
He's got a sweater on.

382
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,357
Animals in people clothes
really freak me out, man.

383
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,943
It's wrong. That's in the Bible.

384

- Ah!

385

00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,159
[Danny] Somebody help me!

387
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,496
He's wearing a shirt!

388
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,788
[both gasp]

389
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,124
- Don't eat me!
- Ah!

390
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,210
Staci. About time you showed up.

391
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:10,006
Sir, it's the middle of the night,
and it's pouring rain, and we're babies.

392
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,799
We're lucky to get here at all.

393
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,176
My diaper absorbed every raindrop.

395
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,641
[Danny] Help me! Please!

396
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,101
- Who's that?
- [Boss Baby sighs]

397
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,228
- Bug the Pug is real.
- [glass shatters]

398
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,356
He's as good as they say
and uglier than you can imagine.

399
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,400
Stole the serum
from right under our noses.

400
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,778
Well, we both got scared,
and you left the door open, and... Ow!

401
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,990
[Danny sobs] Ugh! He's so slobbery!

402
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,365
We'd better help him.

403
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,118
Good idea. You first.

404
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,371
He's just a dog.
He's only scary if you let him be scary.

405
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,581
Easy for you to say.

406
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,583
You're scared of a monster
that's not even real.

407
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,128
The Frodarg is real.
But he's not here right now.

408
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,130
Your monster is,

409
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,549
so let's get him out of here.

410
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,344
But how do we catch
the best corporate thief in the business?

411
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,679
A little bit of liver and a lot of luck.

412
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,599
- Come on, we've got a trap to build.
- What about me?

413
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,727
Simple, Templeton.
You must face the Frodarg.

414
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,020
[thunder rumbles]

415
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,816

Do something!

418
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,281
Stop letting him chase you.
Chase him right back.

00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,270
Get him up the stairs!

430
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,731
[Danny] Get lost, well-dressed pug!

431
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,651
Danny, no! Not outside! Not yet!

432
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,778
Eat light, Frodarg.

433

What is it? Liver?

for one thing.

- Got him?
- Got him good.

Do not let him out of that cooler.

459
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:39,340
Get him to Baby Corp and let the CEO know
that the package is secure.

460

You want the liver back?

461
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,386
Let him eat it.
A gift to a truly worthy adversary.

Is he gonna be okay?

466
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,527
Yeah. He's just wiped
from having to run for a few minutes.

467
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,654
His insides are mostly nacho cheese.

468
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,615
Thanks for the assist, Templeton.

469
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,034
It got way less scary
when we were scared together.

470
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:10,162
And if the Frodarg does show up tonight,
we're ready.

I'm ready for anything.

three hammerhead sharks

with his hind paws while hanging on
to a supersonic jet with his teeth.

Well, the Frodarg once ate 17 farmers
in one night.

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,175
And you know how tough farmers are.

476
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,012
Let's both agree our fears are irrational.
Yours, slightly more so.

And just be grateful the serum's safe.

All in all, a pretty good night.
