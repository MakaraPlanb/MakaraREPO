00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,011
[grunts]

168
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,056
Boss! Estes!

169
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,274
- [Tim playing discordant keys]
- Play it again, Tim.

170
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,611
Grossman's sign-up list of piano students.

171
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,196
Let's go test my theory.

172
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:09,990
[Tim] Fiddlesticks!

173
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:14,995
Dina Namashita?

174
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,204
[babbling]

175
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,164
What do you mean, "What's it to you?"

176
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,084
You think you're the baby pope
or something?

177
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,086
Merely running the numbers on a theory.

178
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,464
You have twin big sisters, Gina and Tina,

179
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,967
taking piano lessons
from old Mr. Grossman?

180
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,845
- [babbling]
- And how's that working out for you?

181
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,805
- [babbling]
- [fingers snap]

182
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,684
Uh-huh. Frequent naps.
They seem distant.

183
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,644
Won't play ponies with you anymore.

184
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,606
My hunch was right!
This is all a Consortium of Ancients plot!

185
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,402
They use piano lessons to get private time
with our big brothers and sisters

186
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,779
so they can turn them against us babies.

187
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,073
That seems needlessly complicated.

188
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,118
- [babbling]
- Yep, got it. Listen, Dina, is it?

189
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,246
We'd love to actually observe
your sisters' changed behavior.

190
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,414
[babbling]

191
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,625
Oh, great. Your grandmothers
will show us where to find your sisters?

192
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,086
[gasps] Dear sweet goodness!
Those <i>are </i>your sisters?

193
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,170
[both gasp]

194
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,175
The Consortium isn't just taking
our big brothers and sisters away,

195
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,595
they're turning them
into junior old people.

196
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,221
[gasps] Templeton!

197
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,308
[playing discordant keys]
Tiddlywinks!

198
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,520
[sighs] Look at my big boy, Beethoven.

199
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,981
Hey, hon, I was taking a trip
down memory lane

200
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,608
with your old college yearbook.

201
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,486
Funny, all the marching band pages
have been torn out.

202
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,615
You're not gonna find anything
worth finding. You might as well quit.

203
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,744
[playing discordant keys]
Horsefeathers!

204
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,581
Mr. G warned me this could happen.
My back's getting sore.

205
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,374
Can you fetch me some liniment, Dad?

206
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:47,087
Uh, let me see what we've got
in the... liniment cabinet.

207
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,632
Templeton, they're turning you
into a mini-geezer!

208
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,094
What? You got a screw loose,
I tell you. A screw loose!

209
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,428
Listen to yourself!

210
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,721
[coos]

211
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,139
[tires screech]

212
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,100
Yo, Tim, hop in shotgun!

213
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,478
My cousin's stepdad just patched up
their above-ground pool.

214
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,856
And they have snakes.
It's like swimming in the Amazon.

215
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,983
Rain check. I have to practice my piano.

216
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,904
Bring it. I'll grab my guitar.
Poolside snake jam!

217
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,156
Why does everyone want to jam with me?

218
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,244
My dance card is full
with piano lessons now, so 23 skidoo.

219
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,412
Bro, we took a "broath."

220
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,999
Never say no to a swimming pool,
even if it's above ground.

221
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,585
I need to practice. Get off my lawn!

222
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,838
You okay? If you need help...

223
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,841
I said, get off my lawn!

224
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,428
[groans] Oh, too far, Grossman.

225
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,682
You want to turn people against me,
take your best shot.

226
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,310
But nobody makes
my fun-lovin' brother grow up!

227
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,772
- Yah!
- Consarn it! What is this tomfoolery?

228
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,151
Whatever you want it to be...
spaceman helmet, robot head.

229
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,070
Let your imagination run wild, please!

230
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,613
We have to snap you out of this.

231
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,616
Fine, but just to prove
you're off your coconut.

232
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,910
And we're off! Where are we, Templeton?

233
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,413
On a shark safari?
In the Martian apocalypse?

234
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,582
[wind whistles]

235
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,208
- Well?
- Well, what?

236
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,628
Why are we standing in the middle
of a field where dreams go to die?

237
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,216
Mmm-mm. Seems like
a nice, quiet place to rest my shins

238
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,218
and think about lunch discounts.

239
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,263
[gasps] What's happening to me?
Who am I anymore?

240
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,140
I'll tell you who you are!
[slaps]

241
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,727
You're Dekker Moonboots, Space Detective!

242
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,395
Urgh!

243
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,648
- I'm...
- You're Centipedeor, unleashed!

244
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,358
Urgh! I'm...

245
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,279
You're Timothy Thrasherton,
Jurassic Rock Star!

246
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,865
I am...

247
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,992
- You're...
- Tim Templeton!

248
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:45,371
What the barf am I doing wasting my summer
on stupid piano lessons?

249
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,748
Yes!

250
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,084
Get this kid 20 ccs
of summertime fun, stat!

251
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,837
[laughing]

252
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,886
[retching]

253
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,304
[laughing]

254
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,015
- Ah-hh!
- Ah-hh!

255
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,475
We better get some sleep.

256
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,603
Got a big day ahead making up
for lost summer fun time.

257
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,147
Tomorrow I'm slapping butter on my hands

258
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,316
and tanking this piano garbage for good.

259
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,777
- Never grow up, Templeton.
- No plans to.

260
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,821
- [sputters]
- [laughs]

261
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:19,989
Good man.

262
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,578
[faint ragtime music playing]

263
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,795
[music continues]

264
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,177
[music continues]

265
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,554
[gasps]

266
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,807
- [music continues]
- [Boss Baby panting]

267
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,186
[gasps]

268
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,731
- Get off my lawn!
- [bangs keys]

269
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,651
- Tim...?
- Gas is <i>how much </i>a gallon?

270
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,362
- Tim!
- Bingo!

271
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,445
[screams]

272
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,994
[Mom] How about some breakfast
for my little early-risers?

273
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,745
Sounds marvelous, Mother.

274
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,504
Did you see the obituaries, Grandmother?
Doris Grabinski died.

275
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,173
97 years old, rest her soul.

276
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,552
She loved to foxtrot. 18 grandchildren.

277
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,846
We can only hope to have such a full life.

278
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,097
Listen up, kiddo.

279
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,726
You're young, it's summer.
Forget that old gasbag Grabinski.

280
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,519
You grab life by the horns.

281
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,938
Do something dumb,
while you can still get away with it.

282
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,441
- Your Gigi's right.
- Break the law if you have to.

283
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,568
Ignore your Gigi.

284
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,654
Humph. Hooliganism.
Mother, Cream of Wheat, please.

285
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,448
Since when do you like Cream of Wheat?

286
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,200
And what's with the glasses?
We doing a costume day?

287
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,286
Ooh! We should make band outfits.

288
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,414
Are you sure you don't want
any Chocolate Cocosplosion

289
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,499
with chocolate marshmallows
in chocolate milk?

290
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,418
Sugar causes glaucoma.

291
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,963
Is that why you're wearing those glasses?
Maybe we should see the eye doctor.

292
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,340
Maybe you should mind
your own beeswax, jack!

293
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,718
Time for my morning constitutional.

294
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,888
Which means my morning poop.

295
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,685
Wow. That kid commits to his costume day.

296
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,230
Maybe he's spending <i>too </i>much time
at the Senior Center with Mr. Grossman.

297
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,734
That old crank Grossman?
I can't stand him.

298
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,194
And his students, ugh!

299
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:25,239
They all wind up crotchety
and way too into that hokey ragtime music.

300
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,533
And you sent my Timmy <i>there?</i>

301
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,498
[TV announcer] <i>A reverse mortgage
is your road to financial independence.</i>

302
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,166
<i>Call today for...</i>

303
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,295
Flibjibbet! I was about to get cash equity
from our home!

304
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,964
[sighs] Okay, Tim.

305
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:46,844
Uh, good news. You graduated
from Mr. Grossman's lessons.

306
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,138
Welcome to T 'N' T.

307
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,682
[Mom] Made it myself! Number-one fan.

308
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,268
I have a recital
at the Senior Center today.

309
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,186
Great.

310
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,146
I'll bring my bass. We'll jam together.

311
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,024
Show those old folks
what rock 'n' roll is all about.

312
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,193
Rock 'n' roll is devil music!

313
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,487
- [gasps] Timothy!
- You take that back!

314
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,616
Your generation's stuck in the past,
but not far enough in the past!

315
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,868
I'm gonna go where people understand me.

316
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,580
No! No! I knew this would happen.

317
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,457
Honey, what? What is it?

318
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,085
He thinks his friends are cooler than us!

319
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,170
He doesn't think we're <i>cool!</i>

320
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,506
[screams] No!

321
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,341
Shh!

322
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,761
<i>Yay! Shooshy stealth mission!</i>

323
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,095
[beeps]

324
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,934
Am-scray, small fry. I'm hoofin' it.

325
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,770
Are you gonna throw
the rest of your summer away?

326
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,231
Kill Dad's dreams of a rock band?

327
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,150
Leave me for the seniors?

328
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,902
I ain't spendin' the rest of my summer
in this hot sun.

329
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,904
Free air conditioning
at the Senior Center.

330
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,408
All-you-can-eat dried fruit.
Good for the constitution. That means...

331
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,827
I know it means poop! Hey! Oh!

332
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:57,165
Let's do imagination again.
Behold, I am Sir Dragonface of...

333
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,001
No more play-acting.
Makes my joints swell.

334
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,962
Old Man Tim is back?

335
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,715
I thought you fixed him
with imagination junk.
