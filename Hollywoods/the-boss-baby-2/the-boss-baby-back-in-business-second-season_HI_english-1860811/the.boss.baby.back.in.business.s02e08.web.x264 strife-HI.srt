your new archenemy made those toys,

174
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,436
and you're not doing anything?

175
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,523
Of course we are.
I said we'd get to the bottom of this.

176
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,192
Full investigation, appropriate vengeance,
standard package deal.

177
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,488
But surely you don't think we should
take this out on our Plushythingies?

178
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,615
Look at these clearly innocent faces.

179
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,325
- But...
- Shh!

180
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,911
Don't listen to the bad man, Bobo.
I know your heart.

181
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,430
- [Gigi] Flip it to Channel 8.
- [all gasp]

182
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,624
That old gossip bag Adele Goldfarb
said Frederic's on the news!

183
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,108
- I was watching commercials.
- [Adele]...<i>plush toy craze...</i>

184
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:27,632
<i>The savvy senior behind the hottest
baby toy in town... Frederic Estes. </i>[yelps]

185
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,718
<i>Hello, television. It's Frederic.</i>

186
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,845
<i>Yeah, I invented your baby's
Plush-a-doodle,</i>

187
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,638
<i>whatever bushwa name we gave it.</i>

188
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,726
<i>So, turns out that toy
has some dangerous design flaws.</i>

189
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,101
<i>Oopsie.</i>

190
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,188
<i>It's just your typical
manufacturing kerfuffles...</i>

191
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,315
<i>rusty nails in the stuffing,</i>

192
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,568
<i>- the fur can give kiddos paper cuts...</i>
- [gasps]

193
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,903
<i>...exposed high-voltage wires...</i>

194
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,155
Oh, my.

195
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,324
<i>...bursts into chemical flame
when exposed to human saliva,</i>

196
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,577
<i>emits an odor that causes hair loss,</i>

197
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,079
<i>prolonged eye contact
makes children go blind.</i>

198
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,205
<i>Blah, blah, et cetera.</i>

199
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,541
<i>Should our viewers feel
like terrible parents</i>

200
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,794
<i>and/or grandparents
for buying such a horrific toy?</i>

201
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,754
[coos]

202
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:10,675
<i>Heavens, no, because my company
is gonna make this right,</i>

203
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,220
<i>by taking them all back.</i>

204
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:15,889
<i>Right now!</i>

205
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,348
- [doorbell rings]
- [gasps] No!

206
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,686
- Mrs. Templeton.
- Mrs. Fardy.

207
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,191
Enough small talk.
I'm here for Plushythingy.

208
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,609
- Ah!
- [all gasping]

209
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,110
There's that death trap.

210
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,655
- Ha! Gimme!
- Hey!

211
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,450
You can't just take
a baby's toy like that.

212
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,035
It's my duty.

213
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,080
And a Fardy takes her duties seriously.

214
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,873
- [crying]
- [laughs]

215
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,375
Fardy duties. Sorry. Not the moment.

216
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,002
So, do we get a refund, or...?

217
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,881
[screams] He's got a taste
for human flesh!

218
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,466
Gigi, do something!

219
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,052
- [crying continues]
- [both grunting]

220
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,137
- [wailing]
- [growls]

221
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,767
Chop, chop, Fardy. Just grab and go.

222
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,394
Take the toys, all the toys.

223
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,564
Don't let them sway you
with their big, sniffly baby faces.

224
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,942
- [knock on door]
- [doorbell rings]

225
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,360
- [cries]
- [Frederic] Faster!

226
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,736
Faster!

227
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,990
Sorry for your loss, little baby.

228
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,119
- Sorry, kiddo.
- [whimpers]

229
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,621
You think this was the plan?

230
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:25,375
Make babies fall in love with the toys
just so he could take them away?

231
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,087
I will avenge you, Bobo.

232
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,174
And then I said,
"I <i>did</i> write my name on it, Steve."

233
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,052
And then Steve said,
"Oh, are you calling me a yogurt stealer?"

234
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,346
So I said, "Yeah, I guess I am, Steve."

235
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,015
Then guess what I did
to his filing cabinet.

236
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,268
[Mom] What's wrong with the baby?

237
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,272
His new toy got recalled,
and he's depressed.

238
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,566
Whoa-oh. [gasps]

239
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,694
You know who feeds on sad babies?

240
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,196
The neck fart monster!

241
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,241
[blows raspberries]

242
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,661
Wow. Nothing. What do we do, Ted?

243
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,831
I don't know. But do you know who would?

244
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,375
Dr. Tickle!

245
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,419
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

246
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,336
[blows raspberry]

247
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,382
Oh, no! Spittle makes Dr. Tickle
melt like a banana splittle!

248
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,759
[chuckles] I love Dr. Tickle!

249
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,429
Glad someone does. Tough crowd.

250
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,098
He'll be fine.
We just need to get his toy back.

251
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,685
Oh, honey, by now, I'm sure
all the toys have been destroyed.

252
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,813
- [whimpers, crying]
- Whoa!

253
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,481
Sounds like a thirsty baby.

254
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,774
You want some milk?

255
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,444
[gasps] My yogurt!

256
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,281
Oh. I gotta call Steve
before he looks in his filing cabinet.

257
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,576
Look at you all. [clicks tongue]

258
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,329
[huffs] Don't you have a TV to watch?

259
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,998
You know, when I lost my slot car track...

260
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,250
Ugh. Again with the slot car track.

261
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,169
I thought I'd never laugh again.

262
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,502
And I never did.

263
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,089
For a long time.
But you wanna know what helped?

264
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,426
Jokes. [clears throat]

265
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,511
What do you call a pork chop?

266
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,806
A pig that does karate!

267
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,683
[chuckles]

268
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,769
Oh, wait. I got it mixed up.

269
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,937
[gasps, grunts]

270
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,104
My comedy career!

271
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,272
Where's Jimbo?

272
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,901
[muffled laughter] Right here,
where I've been the whole time.

273
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,903
- [snorting]
- Is it just me,

274
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,614
or does Jimbo
suddenly seem happier?

275
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,408
What? I'm not happy.

276
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,534
[chuckling]

277
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,079
He's so happy he can't stand it.

278
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,040
- He came from there, behind the sofa.
- [Jimbo] No!

279
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,542
Jimbo, I swear,
if there's a kitten behind that couch...

280
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,088
Yes, it is a kitten.

281
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,631
Meow!

282
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,924
Plushythingy!

283
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,718
But how?

284
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,472
Can I hold it, Jimbo? Jimbo? Jimbo?
Can I hold it?

285
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,475
- Jimbo, can I hold it? Jimbo.
- Turn her off! She's scaring me!

286
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,560
Can I hold it? Jimbo? Now!

287
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,730
Forget her, Jimbo. I'm the boss.
I get first cuddle.

288
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,399
[whimpering]

289
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,776
- Jimbo, I'm ordering you to...
- Ha!

290
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,860
- Oh!
- [cackling]

291
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,861
[yelps, grunts]

292
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,072
- Ha! [panting]
- Oof!

293
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,033
[all grunting]

294
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,118
Stop!

295
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,578
Would you look at yourselves?

296
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,873
Tripping, fighting, hitting...
Spitting, Staci?

297
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,875
I should call the old people right now

298
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,919
and tell them they missed
one Plushythingy.

299
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,003
No! Stop him!

300
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,756
- Ah!
- [all grunting]

301
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Guys!

302
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,653
Gag him! We'll stow him in the basement
till the heat cools off.

303
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,303
Don't you see yourselves? You're...

304
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,848
[muffled grunting]

305
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,059
Wait, wait. Stop. He has a point.
Go on, Templeton.

306
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,812
[grunting continues]

307
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,649
Hmm. Well spoken.
What's worse than no toys for any baby?

308
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,569
One toy that all babies want!

309
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,612
- [grunting continues]
- [Staci gasps]

310
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:45,658
Tim's right! Frederic knew
we'd tear each other apart over this.

311
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,118
What Tim said!

312
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,619
So there's only one solution.

313
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,166
- I should take it.
- But I'll just die without it.

314
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,170
And my ghost will haunt your posterity
for seven generations!

315
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,130
[all grunting]

316
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,133
You're missing the point.
This is exactly what he wants.

317
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,136
As long as this exists,
the team is doomed.

318
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,263
Then, who's gonna fight for babies?

319
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,307
There's only one thing we can do.

320
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,269
Destroy Plushythingy
or it will destroy us.

321
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:17,148
But not at all me. Just the three of you.
It's the toy or the team.

322
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,482
Make the call.

323
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,944
Jimbo, send it off honorably.

324
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
[grunts]

325
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,242
- [grunts]
- You've got to let go, Jimbo.

326
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,704
- [grunts] I'm trying. I can't!
- I got this.

327
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,957
- [inhales, exhales]
- [whimpers]

328
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,544
Just close my eyes,
pretend I'm back in daycare

329
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,506
and Braden just took
the good carpet square.

330
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,553
[yells]

331
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,014
My body won't let me!

332
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,143
I have too many feelings!

333
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,812
Fine. I'll do it.

334
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,318
[yells]

335
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,903
Uh...

336
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,614
Boss.

337
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,911
What is wrong with you babies?

338
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,373
Templeton, what do you think you're doing?

339
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,958
Bon voyage, sailor.

340
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,959
Shh!

341
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,544
- Do you hear that?
- What?

342
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:24,757
The sound of your old Kentucky Outlaw

- [whispers] I can hear it!
- But wait!

344
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,053
What's that rumbling noise? The water!

345
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,139
Templeton, it's so cold!

346
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,183
The basement rats

348
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:43,276
Your toy didn't deserve that,
and neither does this one.

[yells]

350
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,995
Now, if all of us can just come together
and form a rational solution,

351
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,747
- this whole thing...
- Couldn't agree more! Ha!

352
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,501
[all grunting]

353
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,919
- Timmy!
- Gigi!

354
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,546
There's my Bobo back.

355
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,339
BB, hide the toy!

356
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,592
Okay, Dumpy Sad Face,

357
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,012
time to flip that frown
with a Gigi car ride.

358
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,389
Tim, find my keys. You're coming, too.

359
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,641
- [both growling]
- The perfect escape.

360
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:19,645
Together forever,
miles away from any other baby.

00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:20,938
Ta-da!

362
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,857
Look at all these other babies.

363
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,650
I didn't think it was possible,

364
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,694
but she's even worse
when she tries to be nice.

365
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,030
If this joint can't get
your baby spirits up,

366
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,364
I don't know what will.

367
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,992
Have fun, boys.
I'll be in the grown-up lounge.

368
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,786
Templeton, we have to get out of here.

369
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,121
I remember this place.

370
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,625
Free advice: stay away from the ball pit.

- [chomps]

372
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,215
If any baby sees what I've got
behind my back, I'm applesauce.

373
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:52,011
Maybe you should have thought of that
before you, um, got a toy?

374
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,263
No, shoot. There must be a lesson here.

- What? Hey!

381
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,613
He knows everything.
We'll have to take him out.

382
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,240
What? He's a baby.

383
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,699
- [coos]
- Shh.

384
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,910
He'll alert the whole place.
You have to silence him!

385
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,453
Seriously? No!

386
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,497
I just mean put a bottle in his mouth.

387
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,581
Oh.

388
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,376
- He doesn't have a bottle.
- Then create a diversion.

389
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,254

He's very poorly built!

- No way!
- What's worse? Jimbo takes it,

405
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,933

by this drooling, toy-crazed mob?

Hey!

- No, that's fair.
- [Boss Baby grunts]

I was afraid it might come to this,

441
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,405
so I had the triplets bring in
an old friend of yours

442
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,365
to help teach
an important business lesson.

We'll never know sadness, loneliness,
boredom ever again.

448
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,802
Simply hand me Plushythingy,

449
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,389
then you get the car set,
we take the zip-line down to Gigi,

450
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,517
and we leave with everything
our hearts have ever wanted.

Ugh. Who cares? Let's go home.
