00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,974
<i>It's Mega Fat-Not-the-CEO
Just-Regular-Baby-Now, I guess.</i>

174
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,184
Smart play, Turtleneck.

175
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,061
Any progress on proving my innocence?

176
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,023
<i>- Mmmm... Mnh-mnh.</i>
- Keep at it.

177
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,236
Whatever happens, I swear one thing:
I will not take the fall for this!

178
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,029
And I swear one more thing:

179
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,491
I will not be getting new church slacks
from Junior Fancy's!

180
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,369
- Not. This. Day.
- [Staci shrieks]

181
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,914
<i>Church slacks. Junior Fancy's.
Coolie-cool. See you there.</i>

182
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,542
<i>With my bossy posse. Woop!</i>

183
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,168
- Gah!
- [Mom] What do you think, Tim?

184
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,795
Get the worst done first?

185
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,422
Ooh, good call, honey.

186
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,674
First stop on this errand day,

187
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,051
fat stacks of fine slacks!

188
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,262
Now more than ever, we cannot go there.

189
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,807
- Junior Fancy's, here we...
- I have to pee right now!

190
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,890
[Mom and Dad shout]

191
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,237
[chuckles] Whizzing.
Don't have to tell you, right?

192
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,781
Restrooms are for customers only, man.

193
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,123
[smacks lips, hums]

194
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,544
[honks horn]

195
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,509
[gasps]

196
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,393
[bell rings]

197
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,112
[smacking lips, groaning]

198
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,447
Fruit pie?

199
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,201
Mega Fat Regular Baby.

200
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,120
No? We're just doing this now,
without the pie?

201
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,164
[scoffs] Fine. [slurps]

202
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,709
Goo-gah kai?

203
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,711
The baby martial art.

204
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,589
Thought you'd be with your posse
at Junior Fancy's.

205
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,131
How'd you find me?

206
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,509
You're not the only one

207
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,929
who knows his way around
a Chewpie Tracker console.

208
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,057
Gah! Betrayer!

209
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,186
- Your form is exquisite.
- Well, I needed a hobby.

210
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,246
It's amazing, all the free time you have

211
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,566
once you give up
being a professional naughty boy.

212
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,235
Puh-leeze.

213
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,361
And thank you.

214
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,030
I can't tell you how delicious it tastes
in my mouth

215
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,741
to say I'm bringing Boss Baby to justice.

216
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,327
This isn't justice! You know I was framed!

217
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,330
Baby, I don't know nothing
but these sweet moves.

218
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,332
Boom boom, fall-down dropkick!

219
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,000
[slow-motion roaring]

220
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,214
[growls]

221
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,799
[baby fighting noises]

222
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,759
[grunting]

223
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,268
So, how about those politics?

224
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,771
I don't like small talk either, man.
We can just do this.

225
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,981
Oh, thank goodness.

226
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,190
[both grunting]

227
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,778
You're not taking me in.

228
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,947
Take you in, take you out. Whatevs.

229
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,909
I just love being the good guy for once.
[combat yelling]

230
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,290
- [grunts]
- [yelling]

231
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,836
- [Mega Fat grunts]
- What a satisfying...

232
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,046
- [Tim grunts]
- [yells, panting] Huh?

233
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,923
- [gasps]
- [soft groaning]

234
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,841
Back in the car!

235
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,848
I'm buying potato chips.
Why do I have to show ID?

236
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,017
It makes me feel powerful.

237
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,645
Dad, come on, let's go.
Oh, we bought snacks.

238
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,066
[snoring]

239
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,070
[engine revving]

240
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,742
No one escapes me forever, Boss Baby.

241
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,828
Isn't that right, Mr. Fruit Pie?

242
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,372
No!

243
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,251
[chomping, chuckles] Mmm-mmm-mmm.

244
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,964
Hello, evidence!

245
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,008
Let's go clear the boss's name!

246
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,514
All clear. [crunches]

247
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,977
Okay, first stop, slightly delayed,
church slacks!

248
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,232
Umm... After I just ate all those snacks?

249
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,443
They'll be the wrong size if we shop now.

250
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,821
You want me to walk around church
with slacks falling to my ankles

251
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,907
like some kind of holy circus clown?

252
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,828
[sighs] I suppose we could drop off
our water and power bill first.

253
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,455
Re-routing!

254
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,544
[Baby Simmons mutters] Interesting.

255
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,047
You found someone else's fingerprints
on there?

256
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,051
Hmm? Oh, no. Just Boss Baby's.
Nobody tampered with his chewpie.

257
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,013
- Then why did you say "interesting"?
- I just like my work! [chuckles]

258
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,725
Enjoyable! [humming]

259
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,188
Darn it! Come on, think, you guys!

260
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,107
The boss is counting on us.

261
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,984
[brakes squeak]

262
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,988
Water and power bill dropped off.

263
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,739
One errand finally done.

264
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,534
And in record time, for slowness.

265
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,827
But a record, nonetheless.

266
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,912
Celebratory rock!

267
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,873
[loud rock music playing]

268
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,293
What was that?

269
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,014
- Mom, let's go!
- That's the errand day spirit, Timbo!

270
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,807
[car accelerates]

271
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,476
Uhh...

272
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,186
[Boss Baby grunts]

273
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,703
- [yells]
- [gasps]

274
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,748
- [shouts]
- [grunting]

275
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,048
How long have you known me?

276
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,134
When have I ever done anything
against Baby Corp? I'm a company man!

277
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,012
Babies change, Boss Backstabber.

278
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,474
Look at me.
Magnus has me doing daily meditations.

279
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,060
I am at peace with the entire universe.

280
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,311
[deep breath]

281
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,565
But I'm still going to crush you,
for justice.

282
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,275
I was set up!

283
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,319
[mock crying]

284
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,906
"Oh, I'm an excuse baby!" Set up by who?

285
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,449
It's ridicu-cray-cray!

286
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,368
Can we do some doughnuts?

287
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,580
- That's unsafe driving, Tim.
- But the parking lot's empty!

288
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,749
[tires squealing]

289
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,087
- [Dad shouts]
- Whoa! [laughing]

290
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,298
[screams, grunts]

291
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,511
- That stopped being fun seconds ago!
- [brakes squeak]

292
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,844
Whoo!

293
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,056
Kiss me. Right now.

294
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,683
- [Mom] Ohh!
- [kissing noises]

295
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,645
- You okay?
- Fine.

296
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,816
Just thinking about what Mega Fat said.
Set up by who?

297
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,070
Staci, forget looking
for evidence I'm innocent.

298
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,406
We need to focus on finding who's guilty.

299
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,282
<i>Way ahead of you, Boss.</i>

300
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,368
[frightened grunt]

301
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,161
Confess!

302
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,873
Sometimes I eat crayons
just to feel alive!

303
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,000
- Not him. Next!
- [yelps]

304
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,668
[sharp cry]

305
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,129
Confess!

306
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,506
I never understood
what's so great about patty-cake!

307
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,633
It's the camaraderie of it!

308
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,219
- Not her. Next!
- [sharp cry]

309
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,553
Confess!

310
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,516
I enjoy sitting in chairs
and getting yelled at.

311
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,769
Pretty big office, though.
Probably gonna take a while.

312
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,729
Just stay mobile.

313
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,106
<i>Way ahead of you.</i>

314
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,150
Church slacks, ahoy!

315
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,527
Can we make our library run first?

316
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,989
We can check out new books for the baby
so he won't be bored while we shop.

317
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,740
[gibberish]

318
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,118
Honey, that's so sweet.

319
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,957
Looks like Junior Fancy's
is our next closest stop.

320
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,710
Doesn't the bank close early on Saturdays?

321
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,173
Ice cream truck!

322
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,717
Follow it, follow it,
follow it, follow it!

323
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,264
Sometimes I have nightmares
that our house is on fire.

324
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,142
Anyway, hope you guys remembered
to turn off the coffee pot.

325
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,356
Just to confirm. You wanted me
to wear <i>no</i> underwear, right?

326
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,152
I have to pee again.

327
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,987
Grab a cup.

328
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,657
[bell tolling]

329
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,784
Church slacks!

330
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,579
Church slacks!

331
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,332
Church slacks.

332
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,461
4:30 p.m.

333
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,421
High noon.

334
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,764
[growls]

335
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,149
Welcome!

336
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,319
Junior Fancy, incredibly handsome.

337
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,613
- Mwah!
- Oh!

338
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,156
How'd you like to be, too?

339
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,909
No, thank you.
Everything here looks like poop.

340
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,160
Timothy!

341
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,247
We're here for new church slacks.

342
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,792
Right on. Gotta look fly for the Sky Guy.

343
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,629
My man, hope that church has room
for one dapper devil.

344
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,091
Gonna need your savvy eye
for fashion here, too, Daddy-O.

345
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,552
[chuckles] Well, if you really need me.

346
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,314
I just want to talk, Boss Baby.

347
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,650
We can still end this business peacefully.

348
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,861
[gasps] Then, what are these?

349
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,323
Oh. Must be my
"Going Out of Business Sale."

350
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,782
[combative cry]

351
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,535
[grunting and yelling]

352
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,790
[shouts]

353
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,378
- [gasps]
- [war cries]

354
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:12,008
[grunts] They're too tight!
Let me go while you find bigger ones!

355
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,135
[grunts]

356
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,888
We can try a bigger pair. Just hold still!

357
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,392
My dude, looking good
has to start from within.

358
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,810
[yelling]

359
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,646
[combative grunting]

360
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,153
It hurts my feelings
that you make me do this!

361
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:43,623
[groans] I'm so bored.
Will you please just surrender, already?

362
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:44,999
Never!

363
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,710
[exertion grunts]

364
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,089
[grunting]

365
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,758
These ones are even tighter.

366
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,719
They're choking my butt,
and my butt is going to die!

367
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,679
They're two sizes bigger!

368
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,264
[Mega Fat] Oh, my goodness.

369
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,767
That looks shaky-wobbly dangerous
up there.

370
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,436
You should probably jump to safety
into my arms.

371
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,271
Come on, jumpy-jump!

372
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,483
Everything will be fine!
Why don't you trust me?

373
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,068
You're joking, right?

374
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,030
Mad Dog will bring the traitor down, sir.
[barking and snarling]

375
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,282
[stammering] Don't need those.

376
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,452
Boss Baby is innocent.

377
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,578
What?

378
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,871
[disappointed groans]

379
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,956
Wow! Twist!

380
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,250
But... I mean, great, yay, finally.

381
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,169
But when did you realize?

382
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,880
After our happy fun doughnut time
at the power plant.

383
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,841
Then why didn't you say something
before you trapped me

384
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,968
on a dangerously high stack of shoeboxes?

385
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,805
Because it was hilarious! [cackles]

386
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,226
Oh, you should have seen your face
when you thought you were going to prison.

387
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,689
Oh, man, I love being a good guy. [laughs]

388
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,191
Oh, you miserable...

389
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,068
- Whoa!
- No!

390
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,696
- [Mom and Dad] Tim!
- My slacks!

391
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,197
[Tim] Whoa! [impact grunt]

392
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,990
Gotcha!

393
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,158
[pants rip]

394
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,579
I guess they were too tight, huh?
[chuckles]

395
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:09,208
- You're still paying for those.
- But we didn't budget for two new pairs.

396
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,336
Ugh. His old church slacks are fine.

397
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,672
Yes! I mean, amen.

398
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,719
I told you to trust me.

399
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,389
Anywaysies, you seemed
so golly-gee sincere, I thought,

400
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,475
"Well, who even could
have set Boss Baby up?"

401
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,729
- Besides you?
- That's what I'm saying, patsy man!

402
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,314
The Chewpie Tracker system can be altered,

403
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,316
but only by one baby.

404
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,402
The CEO.

405
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,904
But you're not the CEO anymore.

406
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,490
Yes, thank you, I love to remember that.

407
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,285
- That would mean it was...
- [all gasp]

408
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,829
[Boss Baby] Turtleneck Superstar CEO Baby!

409
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,876
Did I set you up? Yes. Reason?
<i>Nollaun Wigi.</i>

410
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,170
The Korean leadership technique,

411
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,298
also known as "Surprise Crisis"?

412
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,468
I went to a seminar.

413
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,139
Precisely. I had to know
if my top candidate for the next CEO

414
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,892
could handle
the most stressful circumstances.

415
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,894
To be clear,

416
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,855
you did just say "top candidate for CEO"?

417
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,899
Yes. You passed.

418
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,195
Uh, ma'am, I'm pretty sure all he did
was run away all day.

419
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,948
But who was back at the office trying
to prove his innocence?

420
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,160
An entire team of allies.

421
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,245
Boss, we got it!

422
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,080
There's a back door
to the Chewpie Tracker,

423
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,708
but it's only accessible by one person!

424
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Guess who?

425
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,046
Dang it.

426
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,507
You can still guess.

427
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,885
Loyalty, inspiring, priceless.

428
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,346
You even won the trust of a former enemy.

429
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,223
That's leadership!

430
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,267
So... [speaks gibberish]

431
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,477
Rewind.

432
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,396
You slipped a tippy-top secret
to Puppy Co,

433
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,817
dibble-dabbled with computer files
to make an underling look guilty,

434
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,528
and all this shenaniganning
was just to test

435
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,656
- if Boss Baby plays well with others?
- Yes.

436
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:08,953
Ooh-wee! New CEO Lady,
you are even more twisted than I was.

437
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,581
And I love it! Call me!

438
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,124
Magnus, let's bounce.

439
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,962
You impress me, Boss Baby.

440
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,422
This ends my praise.

441
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,094
We get promotions
when you're in charge, right?

442
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,429
Private offices with gold-plated potties.

443
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,389
Cool.

444
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,723
[giggles]

445
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,433
[Tim] All good?

446
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,937
Do you see me in baby jail
or you in church slacks?

447
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,730
No, I do not.

448
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,983
Lazy Saturday. Boom.

449
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,821
