[Simmons] Get set, fire!

15
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,426
All right!

16
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,223
I call it "Romper Blaster."

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,225
How do you come up with this stuff?

18
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,896
Ah, I was sick and tired of spending
so much time dressing my dollies,

19
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:07,317
and I figured parents felt the same way
about dressing babies.

20
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,571
So why not blast their clothes on?
[laughs]

21
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,322
Violence is so fun.

22
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,909
As my mentor, Dr. Stubenhaus, always said,

23
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,120
"You'd be amazed how inventive you can be

24
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,497
when you're dang sick of something."
[laughs]

25
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,332
Impressive, Simmons.

26
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,085
But market research
shows only 14 percent of parents

27
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,421
are comfortable firing cannons
at their babies.

28
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,547
This is useless.

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,924
Outstandingly useless.

30
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,846
Brava. The frontier of our dreams
lies at the edge of our nightmares.

31
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,682
- What is happening at this company? Aah!
- That terrible toy

32
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,351
is what this week
in research and development is about.

33
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,564
Stop thinking.
Solve problems that don't exist.

34
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,860
Forget about Stinkless Serum
and anything else that matters.

35
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,322
Now is not the time
to think outside the box.

36
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,283
This week, we <i>smash </i>the box.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,911
And then we rebuild it. Wiser.

38
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,246
- Boss Baby!
- [yelps]

39
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,416
How are you smashing the box?

40
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,835
Mentally? Spiritually?

41
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,505
Eh... sledgehammerly?

42
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,884
You fail to grasp the spirit
of "Smash the Box."

43
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,552
Disappointing.

44
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,723
Ma'am, wait!
Just point me at the box you want smashed!

45
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,806
What's this?

46
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,354
Oopsie Baby Booster,
the Chair Safety Warning System.

47
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,481
It's not quite ready yet.

48
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,942
[Oopsie Baby] <i>Oopsie!
Baby's falling off the chair.</i>

49
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,110
Seems to work fine.

50
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,862
Seems to.

51
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,657
- But if the baby leans too far...
- Simmons!

52
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,993
Turtleneck always loves your work.
Throw me a crumb, anything.

53
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,286
Uh, we're good here.

54
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,747
Maybe you can smash boxes
in your department.

55
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,459
Field operations doesn't have boxes,
just assorted paperwork.

56
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,836
The odd manila file folder and... [gasps]

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,799
Wait a minute! I know how to seize
the inside track on becoming the next CEO!

58
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,716
[Tim] Look at me.

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,927
- I'm an Oopsie Baby.
- [Oopsie Baby] <i>Oopsie!</i>

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,096
- Don't lean too far!
- [Tim shouts]

61
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,264
[Oopsie Baby]
<i>Baby's falling off the chair.</i>

62
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,727
- Still working on the Consequence matrix.
- [Tim yowls]

63
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,398
That was awesome. [spits]
What else you got?

64
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,567
Free business tip:

65
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,612
there's no better way to impress a boss
than being proactive.

66
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,782
Like that time I cleaned my room
without Mom and Dad asking.

67
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,326
[laughs] That never happened.

68
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,995
Templeton, meet the Lonesome Files,

69
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,499
the most frustrating, difficult
company problems you can imagine.

70
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,292
And I'm going to solve them all.

71
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,129
Sounds hard and boring.
We should just invent stuff.

72
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,091
Like this thing Simmons gave me.
No idea what it does, but it looks cool.

73
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,052
- Rain check. This is... ow!
- Whoa! Sorry.

74
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,929
Is your punching box through?

75
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,390
Who's to say?
Mysteries of science, really.

76
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:44,807
Let's see.

77
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,812
Lost toys, anti-baby activists.

78
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,565
- Ah! A classic puzzler.
- [drawer bangs]

79
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,277
Grumpy Baby Grump-Grump,
the baby who will not smile.

80
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,030
<i>He doesn't smile for pictures.
He doesn't laugh from tickles.</i>

81
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,451
<i>He sits in the yard all day
and just growls.</i>

82
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,619
- [weak growl]
<i>- A tragic case.</i>

83
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:09,833
Likes gummy duckies, pat-a-cake.
Dislikes noise, big sister. That's it.

84
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,336
About as helpful as handlebars on oatmeal.
Let's pay him a visit.

85
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,173
- Okay, Grump-Grump.
- [growls]

86
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,301
We need to get you laughing again.

87
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,970
So allow me to present a comedy joke.

88
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,264
He's a baby. They don't understand jokes.

89
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,849
This one has a physical punchline,

90
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,269
therefore a high-yield laughter rate
in babies three to 14 months.

91
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,604
Ahem.

92
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,356
- What do you call a... ow!
- [laughing]

93
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,400
- Templeton!
- That's funny.

94
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,360
- It's... oh!
- [laughing]

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,740
- [grunts] It's not working, Templeton.
- [growls]

96
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,576
If that didn't make him laugh,
nothing will.

97
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,245
Ah, but you didn't let me finish <i>my </i>joke.

98
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:48,871
Ahem.

99
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,167
What do you call "a low-flying waterfowl"?

100
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,251
Duck!

101
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,547
Too intellectual. Noted.

102
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,924
- Ooh!
- [laughing]

103
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,218
- [Boss Baby] Templeton!
- [growls]

104
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,554
"Smash the box"?
That doesn't mean anything.

105
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,972
Or does it mean everything?

106
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,850
Unbox yourself, brain. Gah! [sighs]

107
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,978
Gigi's coming to get you
for a family meeting. Look innocent.

108
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,607
You really don't have to do this, Gigi.

109
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,484
Summer's over before you know it.

110
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,570
I can't go without leaving this family
with one final gift.

111
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,031
A fully potty-trained baby.

112
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,660
- Potty training is the worst.
- Don't you think he's too young?

113
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,996
I potty-trained Ted at this age,
and he turned out great.

114
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,252
- [chuckles] I'm the Pineapple Pro-feth-or!
- [laughing]

115
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,129
Pineapples contain the protein bromelain,

116
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,090
great for tenderizing meat.

117
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,134
- I don't know.
- No, that's really true about pineapples.

118
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,555
- The potty training, Ted.
- Well, might be nice.

119
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,932
Remember how hard it was
to potty-train Tim?

120
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,144
So much. Everywhere.

121
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,899
- All right, if you think you can.
- Oh, I guarantee it.

122
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,818
Got a family method
from the old country.

123
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,612
It puts the baby
in total control of the process.

124
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,030
Just you watch.

125
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,115
[grunts]

126
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,535
It's me, Templeton. As you were.

127
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,037
As I was what? Agh!

128
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,291
- Oh, don't mind me. Please continue.
- Jeez!

129
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,126
Put on some... anything.

130
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,086
No can do, Tim-a-roo.

131
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,590
Gigi's got me on a system.
"The Naked Baby Potty Technique."

132
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,508
How does being naked help?

133
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,177
I set up potty chairs all over the house.

134
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,762
No need for help from grownups.

135
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,181
That way, when it's time for baby to go...

136
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,477
I just crawl over to the nearest potty
and achieve my major milestone.

137
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,894
[thumps]

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,024
Something bothering you?

139
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,026
- You're naked.
- No, I'm not.

140
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,862
I'm not looking again to prove it,
but, yes, you are.

141
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,240
Baby nudity doesn't count.
Totally different from regular nudity.

142
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,577
Your naked butt
is still gonna get all over everything.

143
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,080
[chuckles] Yeah.
But we have bigger fish to fry.

144
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,751
I've gotta knock out these Lonesome Files
if I want Turtleneck to notice.

145
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,170
Here, just put this on
while you're around me.

146
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,087
Pass.

147
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,006
Honestly, I've never felt so relaxed.

148
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,549
I thought you loved diapers.

149
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,302
Who doesn't? But I owe Gigi one.

150
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,388
She bought the Plushythingy toy
when Mom and Dad failed me.

151
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,808
So I put on a little pee-pee pony show,
Gigi looks like a hero,

152
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,811
and when she goes back home,
a few well-timed "accidents,"

153
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,772
I'll be in diapers in a hot second.

154
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,399
I love that you and Gigi
are finally getting along.

155
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,570
But you know what I'd also love?
If your butt wasn't all over everything.

156
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,573
Don't make this about you.
You better hope that's clean.

157
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,868
I am not looking at a naked baby butt.

158
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,286
[sniffs] And I checked.

159
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,374
Wait. If this is for Gigi,
can't you just go on the potty right now?

160
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,625
Presentation.

161
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,337
Gigi needs to feel like she's earned this.
I'll go before bedtime tonight.

162
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,631
Promise? [gasps, retches]

163
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,468
- What?
- Your naked butt is on my Football Mike!

164
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,517
How dare you?
This man was a hero in the football wars.

165
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,728
Ahhh.

166
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,271
All right, Baby Grump-Grump,

167
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,649
let's take a look at you with fresh eyes.

168
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,734
[humming]

169
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:06,987

Oh...

272
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,721

- You okay?
- I'm, uh, not hungry anymore.

341
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,122
Maybe we should try a different technique.

342
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,208
One where, you know,
he can wear some dang pants?

343
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,127
He'll use the potty when he's ready,

344
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,337
even if he has to be naked
for the rest of the summer.

345
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,382
There's gotta be another way.
What if this doesn't work?

Hah! I'm a stubborn old lady, kid.
Nothing outlasts me.

347
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,931
I sat in a protest on the steel mill floor
for three straight days.

348
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,726
Just to get tuna sandwiches
in the vending machines.

349

- We admire our work.

I solved every problem in this room
in a few days.

Imagine what I can continue to do
if I never wear clothes again!

A clean file drawer.

This transforms my mood
from "regular" to "impressed."

356

He was one smart cookie
