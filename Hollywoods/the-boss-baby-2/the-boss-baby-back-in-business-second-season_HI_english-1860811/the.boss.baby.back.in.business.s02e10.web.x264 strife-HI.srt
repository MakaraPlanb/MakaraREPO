I busted out and hid for two weeks
inside a dead tree trunk filled with bees.

after you eat enough bees,

they stop trying to sting you

145
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,299
and just accept
that you're their new queen.

177
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:38,333
I think we should climb up the big slide
so we can see the whole park. Whee!

178
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,419
Oh, or dig an underground maze
and search from below.

179
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,712
We should do everything.

180
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,381
I love being boss!

181
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,715
[yelps]

182
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,342
How am I doing? Great?

183
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,553
[Staci grunting]

184
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,721
- Thank you!
- Ugh!

185
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,265
- [woman] Shh! Sweetheart! Shh!
- [baby crying]

186
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,851
Mommy's gonna find your blankie,
I promise.

187
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,979
I'm sure it's back at home... I hope.

188
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,898
It's right there, stuck on your car!

189
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,067
Uh, that was easy.

190
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,361
She'll probably find it
when they get home.

191
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,363
Show's over, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

192
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,200
Show is not over, <i>mon...</i> Staci.

193
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,288
This is my first job in charge,
and we are going to do it right.

194
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,332
- Come on!
- [huffs]

195
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,666
[seat belt clicks]

196
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,962
[grunting]

197
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,382
- Just leave it, Jimbo.
- I don't want it dragging on the ground.

198
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,967
It could get all torn up.

199
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,177
No blankie deserves that.

200
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,179
Jimbo, it's just a blankie.

201
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,557
[sputtering] Just a blankie?

202
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,810
It's a traveling companion,
a trusted advisor,

203
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,855
a nap facilitator, a best friend.

204
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,858
I'm the boss today,
and we are hand-delivering this blankie

205
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,901
- back to its owner.
- [car engine starts]

206
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,030
Crud!

207
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,950
Double crud!

208
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,705
- [tuning station]
- [banjo music playing]

209
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,958
Banjo, the official soundtrack of camping.

210
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,044
So, how do we do this?

211
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,130
Stop at the fish and pre-toasted
marshmallow vendor for supplies

212
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,090
before we check in at our camping hotel?

213
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,509
Pfft! Have you never been camping before?

214
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,179
Baby... in a business suit.

215
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,056
Look at the picture from last year.

216
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,891
Do you see any fancy stuff?

217
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,936
Dudes' Weekend is about having fun
outdoors the old-fashioned way.

218
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,814
You know what else is old-fashioned?
Smallpox epidemics.

219
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,860
- History is garbage, Templeton.
- [Dad imitating banjo]

220
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,029
It's what the customer wants.

221
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,031
[sighs] Oh!

222
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,575
You don't have to do anything.
You're the baby.

223
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,537
We do the camping stuff, you just smile
and make those noises grown-ups like.

224
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,622
Good call.

225
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,208
I can trot out
some classic baby reactions,

226
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,710
amp up the cute factor to a 9.3.

227
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,419
[Dad] Rocky Peak!

228
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,715
We're really close. Tim, show the baby.

229
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,759
Cute factor, 9.3.

230
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,179
[giggling]

231
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,308
Aww! That's my little man!

232
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,352
Lake Turtlemouth is just around...

233
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,686
- [giggling]
- The heck?

234
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,438
- [tires screech]
- [all grunt]

235
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,147
What is it?

236
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
- Aw!
- [gasps]

237
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,571
- [both panting]
- [Staci grunts]

238
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,575
[car horns honking]

239
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,743
Jimbo, wait!

240
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,995
- [car horn honks]
- No!

241
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,249
Why'd you stop me? I had them!

242
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,584
You were about to run into traffic!

243
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,670
I was following my heart.

244
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,006
Then, buddy, your heart's trying
to turn you into a street pancake.

245
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,508
I'm sorry, Staci.

246
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,427
I... I just don't wanna lose
another blankie.

247
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,805
Not like before.

248
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,683
You're dying to tell me the story,
aren't you?

249
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,853
I left my blankie for just a second,
and when I came back...

250
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,187
[sniffling]

251
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,857
I'm too close to this! [sobbing]

252
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,401
We'll get that kid his blankie back, okay?

253
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,572
You just can't follow every instinct
that hits your mushy parts.

254
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,741
That's what got us into this mess
in the first place.

255
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,995
[gasps] So you're saying
maybe that's what gets us out!

256
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,830
That is not at all what I am saying.

257
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,373
Show us the way, blankie.

258
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,792
Let the wind blow us to your home.

259
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,964
You didn't really expect that to...

260
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,425
[both wailing]

261
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,758
[both grunt]

262
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,344
[giggles]

263
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,306
Is... Is Lake Turtlemouth closed?

264
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,974
How do you close a lake?

265
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,059
It can't be closed. Try the gate.

266
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,978
[grunting]

267
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,229
It's not budging.

268
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,647
Are we in the right place?

269
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,191
I took the right turn at Widow's Gulch.

270
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,651
Or was it a left?

271
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:37,988
[snaps fingers]

272
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,950
- What's the plan, Templeton?
- I don't know.

273
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,911
Maybe Dad can find us
another place to camp.

274
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,496
- It's all the same, right?
- All the same? [sighs]

275
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,373
Templeton, Templeton.

276
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,377
What's your favorite drive-thru hamburger
and French fried potato establishment?

277
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,296
Fatso Phantom's Ghostburger To Go.

278
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,380
Of course it is.

279
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,925
And what would you say
if on your next visit

280
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:00,845
to Mr. Phantom's "restaurant,"
instead of a juicy burger,

281
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,057
they served you an asparagus-beet salad
with lemon vinaigrette?

282
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,058
Ew!

283
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,809
Ew, precisely.

284
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,228
This is the Fatso Phantom Ghostburger.

285
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,149
It's not the finest establishment in town,
but it's proven it works

286
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,443
and it's what makes the customer happy.

287
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,279
Anyplace else is just asparagus and beets.

288
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,492
- We are not going asparagus-beet camping.
- Darn right we're not.

289
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,203
That stupid fence is going down!

290
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,123
[grunting]

291
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,807
- What are you doing?
- Picking the lock.

292
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,045
- You know how to pick locks?
- I saw it on TV, so I assumed I could.

293
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,173
[sighs] Uppies.

294
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,925
You know how to pick locks?

295
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,094
[scoffs] Corporate espionage, Templeton.

296
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,137
If you're not going through
your coworkers' desks,

297
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,681
you're not corner office material.

298
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,560
Hey, it's open!

299
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,270
[Tim] Just needed a good push.

300
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,481
- The baby helped.
- [cooing, giggling]

301
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,358
Aw, I bet he did.

302
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,777
Looks like Lake Turtlemouth is back on.

303
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,654
I love Dudes' Weekend.

304
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,992
Yay! Thanks, blankie!

305
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,326
Thanks for what?

306
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,371
We don't even know
if we're going in the right direction.

307
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,873
If you follow your heart,
you can't go wrong.

308
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,334
[sirens wailing]

309
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,421
Ooh, police cars!

310
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,755
- [thumps]
- [both grunt]

311
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,637
Triple crud!

312
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,181
[birds chirping]

313
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,767
Dudes' Weekend.

314
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,310
Dudes' Weekend.

315
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,942
This has to be mankind's least
efficient method of acquiring seafood.

316
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,194
But if it's what the customer wants...

317
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,528
Hey!

318
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,906
[laughs]

319
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,534
Hey, Dad, I think the baby
wants to fish, too.

320
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,245
[laughs] That is the cutest thing!

321
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,620
Where's my camera?

322
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,208
- [reel clicking]
- Ooh, I think you're getting a nibble.

323
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,545
Fart poop doody, it's alive!

324
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,590
- Say chee... uh... uh...
- [splashes]

325
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,301
Oh. Oh, dear.

326
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,889
Dudes' Weekend!

327
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,349
- [siren wails]
- Ten-sixty-four. Ten-sixty-four.

328
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,476
Crime in progress.

329
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,312
Campground trespassing.

330
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,440
[man] <i>Doug, you know we're chasing
an actual bank robber back in town.</i>

331
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,151
Darn it to heck! I just said I'm busy!

332
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,570
[sirens wailing]

333
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,697
[evil laugh]

334
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,033
Eat tailpipe, Smokey!

335
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,118
I got a tank full of gas

336
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:33,456
and enough stolen cash
to put my baby through Ohio State...

337
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,292
for one full semester!

338
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,545
We're riding getaway
with a bank robber, Jimbo.

339
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,066
The cops are gonna capture her,
and then they're gonna find us

340
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,759
and guess who's back in daycare, huh?

341
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,761
[hyperventilating]

342
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,055
What are we gonna do, <i>boss?</i>

343
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,099
I don't know. I just follow my heart.

344
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,767
And my heart says...

345
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,560
[gasps] Ooh! Garden hose!

346
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,356
[Jimbo in spooky voice] Bank robber!

347
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,902
What the...?
All right, who's in my bank robbing truck?

348
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:07,073
I'm the spirit of your childhood blankie.

349
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,158
I need you to go to...

350
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,412
529 Conklin Avenue.

351
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,622
Or else!

352
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,793
Cool, I won't have to go to daycare
because we'll be dead.

353
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,628
Trust the process.

354
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,297
[mocking] Oh. Terrifying.

355
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,926
But guess what.
I never had a blankie when I was a kid.

356
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,763
What do you think set me on the path
of thievery and moral turpitude?

357
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,306
[grunting] Get... I will...

358
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,893
[gasps] She's got no conscience.
My heart lied to me!

359
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,479
I swear to... Who's really back there?

360
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,898
[Staci] Tiny ghosts, sucker!

361
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,568
- [shouting]
- [tires squealing, crashes]

362
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,779
Well, scratch the fish portion
of the perfect weekend.

363
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,574
Gotta come back strong
with these marshmallow brûlée-kabobs.

364
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,491
How are they coming?

365
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,535
[grunting]

366
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,329
You know how to make a fire with sticks?

367
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,457
I saw it on TV, so I assumed I could.

368
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,750
[grunting] Oh!

369
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,085
What about matches?

370
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,755
Ha! You think I'd bring matches
where a baby could get them?

371
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,964
[gasps]

372
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,885
Sorry, boys. No toasted marshmallows.

373
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,553
I better go pitch the tent.

374
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,599
- What?
- I'm the beet-asparagus salad.

375
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,516
What?

376
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,311
What's different
about this Dudes' Weekend? Me!

377
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,315
It's all going sideways
because of the baby, and I'm the baby!

378
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,733
We have to turn this around.

379
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,735
Can you eat marshmallows without toasting?

380
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,904
- Oh!
- Not when you're camping.

381
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,071
That's a sin!

382
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,948
The happy photograph, Templeton!

383
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,743
We're losing it all.
Fix it, fix it, save me!

384
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,204
We haven't lost all of it.

385
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,873
We just have to get Dad
and me and you there,

386
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,833
the perfect viewpoint.

387
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,044
For the perfect photo!

388
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,463
Time to save Dudes' Weekend.

389
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,673
- [car horn honking]
- [woman groaning]

390
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:48,925
[both groaning]

391
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,302
Blankie, I'm so sorry.

392
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,221
I just wanted to get you home.

393
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,680
I tried to follow my heart,

394
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,767
but everything just took you
farther and farther away.

395
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,684
[sniffles]

396
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,978
I should never have been in charge.

397
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:03,897
Huh!

398
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,108
529 Conklin Avenue.

399
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,486
[gasps] Blankie, you're home!

400
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,572
But, Staci, how did you know
the exact right moment

401
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,699
to make that bank robber crash her truck?

402
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,992
I didn't.

403
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,827
Everything was going doody-side up,

404
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,914
so I just grabbed the blanket
and followed <i>my</i> heart.

405
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,334
My twisted black heart. [chuckles]

406
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,920
You did a Jimbo, and it worked!

407
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,547
Learn from the best.

408
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,674
Lead the way, Boss.

409
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,386
[sirens wailing]

410
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,096
[tires screeching]

411
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,265
Freeze! Step out of your car.

412
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,684
[groaning, murmuring]

413
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,730
Are those babies
climbing up the side of that house?

414
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,233
[man over radio] <i>Debbie, bank robber.
Focus up.</i>

415
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,194
[Dad whistling tune]

416
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,278
Nah, that's not it.

417
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,447
[whistling tune]

418
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,074
[sighs] I used to know this.

419
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,576
It's a classic hiking song.

420
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,705
Ooh, maybe the bass part.
[imitating funky bass]

421
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,707
[sighs] Never mind.

422
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,584
Where is that perfect viewpoint?

423
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,629
Is that the trail? No.

424
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,131
Uh, that one!

425
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,465
No, that's a raccoon.

426
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,802
- Dad, do you know where we're going?
- Of course!

427
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,595
No.

428
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,222
[sighs] Boys, it's getting late.

429
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,516
We... We may have to call this off.

430
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,767
No way, Dad!

431
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,104
This is Dudes' Weekend,
and dudes never give up,

432
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,773
because we're having
too much fun to quit, right?

433
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,275
- [Doug] Wrong!
- [Templetons] Ah!

434
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,609
Dudes.

435
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:31,902
[baby fussing]

436
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,323
[woman] Did we leave Jamie's B-L-A-N-K-I-E
at your place yesterday?

437
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,576
No, not "bonkley!" His blankie!

438
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,745
[wailing]

439
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,664
Shush, shush, shush. It's cool, kid. Shh.

440
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,625
Jimbo, it's your rodeo.

441
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,752
[excited cooing]

442
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,211
Hold it close.

443
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,965
You've got to love your blankie
as much as your blankie loves you.

444
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,634
[woman] Hang on. He just quieted down.

445
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,718
Oh, let me check on him.

446
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,179
You found it!

447
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,848
Oh, sweetie, I told you it would turn up.

448
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,687
And that's the story
of how Jimbo was in charge,

449
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:11,275
and everyone followed their heart,
and it all worked out in the end.

450
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,027
Those are babies up there!

451
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,571
Infinity crud.

452
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,033
Oh, oh, so your climbing babies
can be real,

453
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,411
but my tiny ghost
is just crazy bank robber talk?

454
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,413
You're such a Debbie.

455
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,543
What kind of dad brings his own kids
on a misdemeanor trespass?

456
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,296
[scoffs] What kind of outing is that
for a family?

457
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,674
We're not a family, we're dudes!

458
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:35,883
Tim, shush.

459
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,009
Officer, I'm sorry.

460
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,013
If you'll let my wife come get the kids,
I'm prepared to go quietly.

461
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,683
Wait, so otherwise,
you were gonna fight me right now?

462
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,016
No, sir!

463
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,855
I'm not letting Johnny Law
interfere with a good business plan.

464
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,233
- We're not done here.
- What are you gonna do?

465
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,403
On the field team,
we call it "doing a Jimbo."

466
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,656
[Dad shouting]

467
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,784
Agitated perp! I need backup!

468
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,326
[Dad groans]

469
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,078
[Tim] Hey!

470
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,623
Pssh. Great parenting.

471
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,583
Wonder where they get <i>that </i>from.

472
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,835
Tim, what...?

473
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,962
Answer: Not the mom.

474
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,338
Extra credit: It's the dad.

475
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,382
- [panting]
- What are you doing?

476
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,676
I can't go to jail. I'm too innocent!

477
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,011
Officer Doug doesn't end Dudes' Weekend.

478
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,431
We do, with a happy dad or bust.

479
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,934
- [both shouting]
- Dead end!

480
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,812
[gasping]

481
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,772
Boys, you gotta stop.

482
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,067
And not just because...
because I'm in terrible shape.

483
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,610
But, Dad, we can't just...

484
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,694
I don't believe it.

485
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,739
Tim, this is it!

486
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,115
The viewpoint!

487
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,827
Whoa, you're right!

488
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,119
[giggling]

489
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,664
Time for one perfect photo?

490
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,999
Let's dude it!

491
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,502
[timer ticking]

492
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,298
Everyone say "Dudes' Weekend!"

493
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,800
- [Dad and Tim] Dudes' Weekend!
- [bird screeching]

494
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,092
Ah!

495
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,556
[Dad sobbing] No!

496
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,891
[splashes]

497
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,893
The Thunderbird.

498
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,311
He got his revenge.

499
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,606
Sorry everything went wrong, Dad.

500
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,233
We just wanted to have a fun weekend
with you.

501
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,278
You know, so you'd be happy.

502
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,238
[Dad chuckles]

503
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,242
[laughing]

504
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,499
- [Doug shouts]
- [Dad grunts]

505
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,084
- [door slams]
- [harmonica blues playing]

506
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,340
Harmonica,
the official soundtrack of jail.

507
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,424
[keys jingle]

508
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,596
Um, Mr. Templeton, you are, thankfully,
not my problem anymore.

509
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:51,560
- Uh, h-h-hi, hon...
- Nope.

510
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,941
What do we do about them?

511
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,403
Code Bink-Bink too much to handle,
Jimbo?

512
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,157
Actually, sir, the blankie was returned,
no problem.

513
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,659
Jimbo did great.

514
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,246
Getting arrested was all part of the plan.
Right, buddy?

515
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,455
[nervous laugh] Mm-hmm!

516
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,706
Glad to hear it.

517
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,959
Guess you won't need me
to pick the lock then.

518
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,752
Boss, don't leave us here.

519
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,630
Brain, not heart, on this one, Jimbo.

520
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,007
You're babies. Just slip between the bars.

521
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:25,885
Oh, yeah.

522
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,100
Looks good to me.

523
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,185
Good? It looks awesome.

524
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,646
Even better than last year's photo.
