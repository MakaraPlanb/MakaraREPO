00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,177
[grunting]

14
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,303
Die! Dead!

15
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,849
And that is the story of my career
as of 30 minutes ago,

16
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:03,272
when I allowed Frederic Estes to steal
Baby Corp's only vial of Stinkless Serum!

17
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,898
Poor little metaphor!

18
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:08,819
So, now we have maybe 15 minutes
to come up with a foolproof plan

19
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,822
to keep Turtleneck Superstar CEO Baby
from firing me.

20
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,532
No wrong answers. Jimbo.

21
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,950
Apology hugs?

22
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,326
Wrong answer! Staci.

23
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,204
I always keep a Plan "B" in my backpack.

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,456
It's spiders!

25
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,251
Oh, what? So you release them
into Baby Corp

26
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,894
and I squash them, looking like a hero?

27
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,839
Why would you kill my babies?

28
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,923
[growls] Templeton!

29
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,758
Sometimes when I mess up
with Mom and Dad,

30
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,095
I do something nice to show I'm sorry,
like extra chores or...

31
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,680
Brilliant, Templeton! Stop talking!

32
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,473
I can see the plan now!

33
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:43,395
Is that Boss Baby up there performing
unselfish service for this company?

34
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:47,065
Please, Templeton,
I don't want recognition.

35
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,526
Doing good is its own reward.

36
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,570
What a virtuous example!

37
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,823
Baby Corp is lucky to have him,
and should never consider firing him.

38
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,992
Hello, work associates.

39
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,078
Who would like to see my new trampoline?

40
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,540
- What?
- How delightful! I will be right down.

41
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:08,128
Oh, no! He's slipping
off the window washing platform!

42
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,772
- [babies gasping]
- [Boss] That is an accurate description

43
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,256
of what is happening.

44
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,216
- [gasping continues]
- [Jimbo] Boss Baby, no!

45
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,261
- [glass shatters]
- [screaming]

46
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:20,223
How could such a terrible tragedy
have occurred?

47
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,310
It no longer matters
what Boss Baby did wrong.

48
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,271
Let us mourn him
in traditional baby style.

49
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,316
[crying]

50
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,069
Wah, wah, wah.

51
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,197
Then I wait three weeks,
show up with a few bandages,

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,158
and everyone's so glad to see me,
all is forgiven.

53
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,910
Ooh! Great plan, Tim.

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,870
That was nothing like my plan.

55
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,040
Yeah, we plussed it in the meeting.
My career's on the line, Templeton.

56
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,207
You in or out?

57
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,752
- We're brothers. Of course I'm in.
- [Mom] Boys!

58
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,256
Your dad and I were wondering
if you could keep all the screaming down.

59
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,801
Um, no one's screaming, Mom.

60
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,554
Well, you're about to be, from excitement,

61
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,682
for end-of-summer
inside-the-house mini golf!

62
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,353
[screaming]

63
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,398
Your dad called dibs
on the front hallway for his hole.

64
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,400
Gigantic rapids.

65
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,693
Honey, do we any bigger canoes?

66
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,948
And I'm cooking up a par seven nightmare
in the kitchen,

67
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,451
so whatever hole you're designing,
challenge me!

68
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,038
Oh, I got your challenge: Magma Madness,

69
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,834
featuring vinegar
and baking soda volcanic explosions

70
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,003
- that will crush your golf ball!
- [clattering]

71
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,093
But, um, first, I'll need time
to let the baby help.

72
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,053
It is his first family mini golf.

73
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,888
We'll build Magma Madness together.

74
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,533
Probably take us a while,
don't check on us.

75
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,767
Why would you? What? Just mini golf stuff.

76
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,685
Aw!

77
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,520
What a good big brother.

78
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,772
Yes, I am.

79
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,649
Tell me this is gonna be quick.

80
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,794
I'm a business baby.
I'll tell you whatever you wanna hear.

81
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,818
Let's do this!

82
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,280
[Templeton] Add vinegar. Baking soda.

83
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,616
Mix 'em up, and I can make it
look like you were so terrified,

84
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,660
your brain exploded.

85
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,912
- [imitates explosion]
- Ooh!

86
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,248
You're suddenly way
too into my fake death.

87
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,125
Whatever gets me back to mini golf.

88
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,169
[elevator dings]

89
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,837
Brain-splosion is cooking.

90
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,940
Just give it two minutes
to build pressure, and...

91
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,841
Babies of Baby Corp!

92
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,343
[gasps] Too late!
She's announcing my firing!

93
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,263
- Templeton, abort!
- But I already did the... [whimpers]

94
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,516
Plan "B." Spider babies!

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,772
Crisis! Our intel indicates Frederic Estes
and the Consortium of Ancients

96
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,568
are plotting something <i>big</i>
for tomorrow's local End o' Summer Fest.

97
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,569
Ugh!

98
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,362
We're already late for family mini golf,

99
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,948
and now Estes
wants to ruin the town carnival!

100
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,075
What is happening to my end o' summer?

101
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,161
Inconceivable as it might seem,

102
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:51,458
we must assume our enemies have decoded
the formula for Stinkless Serum.

103
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,210
- Oh, no! Stinkless Serum!
- Oh, no!

104
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,878
- That belongs to us!
- Already?

105
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,631
Sir, if old people get rid
of their bad smells

106
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,757
and babies still stink,

107
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,259
we're gonna get crushed
on the love charts!

108
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,429
That was gonna be our secret weapon!

109
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,723
How did old people even get it?

110
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,267
Using the stolen vial
that was supposed to be guarded

111
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,814
by our VP of Field Operations, Boss Baby.

112
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,108
- He's over there. You may frown at him.
- [all growling]

113
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:21,655
Solution: If old people plan to unveil
their own Stinkless Serum tomorrow,

114
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,949
we must make today our tomorrow.

115
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,034
- [all] Huh?
- Explanation:

116
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,789
We are re-cracking
Stinkless Serum ourselves, today.

117
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,501
All of you have been transferred
to Research and Development

118
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,004
as of when I finish this sentence.
There. Done.

119
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,631
[whirring]

120
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,799
[flies buzzing]

121
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:45,178
Drool stains. Sweaty little baby booties.
Spit-up.

122
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,181
In total, eight bad baby smells.

123
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,849
Baby fatty roll crust?

124
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,894
That's a Category Five baby odor,
weapons grade.

125
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:57,023
Your assignment:
Find a formula that will unstink them all.

126
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,986
So we're supposed to become experts
in molecular chemistry by 5:00 p.m.?

127
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,529
[Turtleneck] And for those of you

128
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,366
worried about mastering
molecular chemistry by 5:00 p.m.,

129
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,785
allow me to sweeten the pot.

130
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,080
Forget about who you are, where you are,

131
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,208
or what you've done to help
or hurt Baby Corp.

132
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,379
If you solve the formula
for Stinkless Serum,

133
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,340
you get the job of CEO.

134
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,883
[gasps] Ah!

135
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,695
- I gotta crack that formula!
- CEO!

136
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,137
I am so gonna crack that formula!

137
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,513
Boss, you could do it!

138
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,475
5:00 p.m.? I can't take that long.
I'll miss mini golf.

139
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,146
Forget 5:00 p.m. With my desperation
and your chemistry skills,

140
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,398
we'll have the serum cracked
in an hour, tops.

141
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,649
What chemistry skills?

142
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,837
You made that vinegar-baking soda thing
that was supposed to go off in two min...

143
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,778
- [explosion]
- [baby screams]

144
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,031
Somebody's brain exploded!

145
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,824
- [whimpers]
- [Templeton chuckles]

146
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,451
Oh, yeah. I'm awesome.

147
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:58,501
Heads up: With the CEO job on the line,
this place is about to get nuts.

148
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,713
Backstabbing, sabotage,
alliances and betrayals.

149
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,508
As of right now, no one is trustworthy,
not even you two.

150
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,886
- What? Shame on me!
- [Staci giggles]

151
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,306
Yeah, I'm pretty much capable of anything.

152
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,809
You want me to use my dark powers
in your unholy service?

153
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:15,977
- Yes, please.
- Cool.

154
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,314
Hey, come on. You don't want to win dirty.

155
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,608
[Staci grumbling]

156
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,891
I thought you were in a hurry
to get back for tiny golf.

157
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,322
I am. But if I'm helping with this,
we do it my way.

158
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,323
Your way?

159
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,201
- Or should I say, the way of...
- [thunder crashes]

160
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,454
Dr. Baron Von Science Fair...

161
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,499
- [thunder crashes]
- the Third!

162
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,668
There's my mad chemist.

163
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,462
Bring me your smelliest challenge.

164
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,091
We will fight its bad smells
with a concoction of good smells,

165
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,844
and science away the stink. [cackles]

166
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,888
Stanky Blankie!

167
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,308
Ground cinnamon,
plus tropical fruit gummi ducks!

168
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,270
[cackles]

169
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,730
[sniffing]

170
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,065
- [retching]
- [Staci] Mm-mm.

171
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,027
Bring me your second smelliest challenge!

172
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:07,821
[Jimbo] Goopy chupie!

173
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:12,075
Fresh popcorn, plus those markers
that smell like hot dogs!

174
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,995
[giggles, cackles]

175
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,163
[sniffs, shudders]

176
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:21,209
It makes me want to cry and barf
and go doody all at once!

177
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,335
[Boss grunts]

178
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,628
We're getting nowhere!

179
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,132
Your concoctions smell like wet dogs
and Southern dumpsters!

180
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,175
Keep cracking, Baby Corp.

181
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:34,347
Cast out your smelly missteps
and point your noses achievement-ward!

182
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,434
You're right.
We'd have to be mad to continue!

183
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,727
[cackles]

184
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,811
Again!

185
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,271
Fresh-baked bread!

186
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,732
Candles from that store at the mall!

187
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:47,485
- Ginger ale burps!
- [belches]

188
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,990
Behold my creation: Werewolf Hot Rod!

189
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,117
Uh, Werewolf Hot Rod?

190
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,578
Every invention works better
with a cool name.

191
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,540
That's a mad science fact.
Now put it to the test!

192
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,375
[cackles]

193
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,629
[flies buzzing]

194
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,007
- [dings]
- [Boss gasps]

195
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,090
- [dings]
- Yes!

196
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,343
[buzzer blares]

197
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,803
Werewolf Hot Rod!

198
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,347
It destinkified drool stains and spit-up!

199
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,641
- That's two bad smells down!
- [monitor beeping]

200
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,186
- [baby 1] What? No!
- [baby 2] No!

201
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,812
- Boss Baby got two already!
- But...!

202
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:28,401
Nothing to see, people!
Eyes on your own work! Come on!

203
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,195
- Darn it!
- Why "darn it"?

204
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,572
You've cracked two out of eight
bad smells already.

205
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,326
I thought we'd be done by now.
This is gonna take forever!

206
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,161
You're on a roll, Dr. Baron.

207
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,222
- Just keep your head in the game.
- Don't say "game!"

208
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,249
I'm trying not to think
about the mini golf game back at home,

209
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,127
and now I'm thinking about
the mini golf game back at home.

210
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,255
Hoo-hoo! I solved spit-up smell!

211
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,926
Look out, CEO job, I'm coming for you!

212
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,345
The others are catching up.
Faster, Templeton!

213
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,765
Think, think! We need a hole in one.

214
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,518
Ugh! I can't stop thinking
about mini golf!

215
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,436
You gotta unleash me, sir.

216
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,939
I can slow down the competition
like molasses.

217
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,942
Sorry, I meant with molasses.
Or spider backpack.

218
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,319
Just so you know,
that option's still on the table.

219
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,072
Hey! I said we don't have to win dirty.

220
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,157
But I really wanna!

221
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,828
Jimbo can handle mixing
Tim's science junk by himself.

222
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:20,829
Don't make me!

223
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,374
I already got werewolf smell
all over my fingers, and it's scaring me!

224
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,834
Everybody calm down.

225
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,877
Staci, you know
I love your twisted handiwork,

226
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,754
but Templeton says he's got this.

227
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,339
Go make a supply run. Cool down.

228
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,883
Fine!

229
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,255
Jimbo, let's hose that werewolf stink
off your hands.

230
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,470
Yay!

231
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,596
[sniffs, screams]

232
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,183
- Templeton.
- Ten-minute golf break?

233
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,518
- Sure.
- Yes!

234
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,354
If you'll solve one more smell for me
before you go.

235
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,438
Deal!

236
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,523
[Jimbo mumbles]

237
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,446
[Chip] Ah, come on!
You're killing me, spit-up!

238
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,574
- Worker Baby Chip, right? What's wrong?
- [sniffs]

239
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,118
Just can't seem to un-stink
the grossed-out bib.

240
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,244
[yells]

241
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,414
My serum works on the booties,
the sour milk bottle...

242
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,040
You cracked sour milk bottle?

243
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,959
Oh, yeah, that one was tough.

244
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,461
But I hear you solved the drool stains.

245
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,673
[chuckles] Yeah. Now, that one was... Wait.

246
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,633
If I've got drool stain beat,

247
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,636
- and you've got sour milk...
- Swap formulas?

248
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,012
Nuh-uh!

249
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,764
I don't want to give your team
an advantage

250
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,767
when you're just a putt away
from the winning shot.

251
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,271
[echoing] <i>Putt away! Winning shot!
Putt away! Winning shot!</i>

252
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,689
Mini golf.

253
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,442
We have to swap formula secrets.

254
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,736
It would help both of us.
That's fair, right?

255
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,781
That should fix sour milk for you.

256
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,617
And there's your drool-proof solution.

257
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,078
Oh, and real quick,
can I borrow your stinkiest formula?

258
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,456
This one smells like asparagus farts!

259
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,709
Perfect! Finally, it's tee time for Tim!

260
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,170
What's this?

261
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,631
The solution for sour milk. Golf break!

262
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,717
Send me three beeps on the baby monitor
if you have an emergency!

263
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,679
- You boys good to golf? Tim?
- [toilet flushes]

264
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,599
- [parents groaning]
- Don't go in there!

265
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,018
Bad asparagus sickness.

266
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,064
Wait. I haven't bought any asparagus
since... [gasps] That explains so much!

267
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,733
Your mom and I are ready to putt
whenever you are!

268
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,027
- How's Magma Madness?
- Fine. Baby's sleeping.

269
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,213
We shouldn't talk about it anymore.
It might wake him.

270
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,132
Can we golf a different hole
while we're waiting?

271
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:25,286
Oh, well, sure,
if you think you're ready to face...

272
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,957
the Labyrinth of Red-Footed Death!

273
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,752
If you can sink it in the red shoe
in less than three putts,

274
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,671
you get double dessert for a week.

275
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,048
Triple desserts if I sink it in two.

276
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,050
[chuckles] It's on!

277
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,223
[clinking]

278
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,816
- Yes!
- One more putt to hit the red shoe.

279
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,903
Triple desserts on the line.
To the victor, fudgy glory.

280
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:03,282
Will Tim Templeton's parents be dealing
with bedtime hyperactivity all week?

281
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,575
[Tim sighs]

282
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,720
- [baby monitor chiming]
- [gasps]

283
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,912
What's that beeping?

284
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,456
One of my toys is out of batteries.
Don't worry about it.

285
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,960
- [chiming continues]
- [growls]

286
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,669
- Whoops!
- [clattering]

287
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,339
Shoot! That leads downstairs.

288
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,758
I'm gonna have to go find that ball
in the basement.

289
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,803
I might be a while, but don't come
help me. This is my responsibility! Bye!

290
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,805
Way to play with honor, son!

291
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,933
I was one putt away from triple desserts!

292
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,309
This better be important.

293
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,145
Ugh! What's that smell?

294
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,314
- That's the stink of betrayal!
- What?

295
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,692
That formula didn't solve sour milk!

296
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,903
Expired cottage cheese, plus clam juice?

297
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,114
Who thought that was gonna work?

298
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,868
- But I traded with...
- Chip, of all babies?

299
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,162
Chip who steals copy machines?

300
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:54,876
I told you we couldn't trust anyone,
but most of all, never trust a Chip!

301
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,962
I did it! De-stunked another one!

302
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:02,759
Sour milk, spit-up, sweaty baby booties,
and drool stains!

303
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,343
[monitor beeping]

304
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,180
- [baby 1] Drool stains?
- [baby 2] Impossible! How did he get that?

305
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,431
Whoa!

306
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,266
Four down, four to go.

307
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,769
Sniff my inevitable victory, loser babies!

308
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,728
[Turtleneck] Bravo, Chip!

309
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,021
[sniffing]

310
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,065
Do I smell a future CEO?

311
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,816
[chuckles]

312
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,693
Not yet. Keep working, babies.

313
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,321
We had a deal! It was fair!

314
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,199
Don't cry over sour milk! [chuckles]

315
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,451
I tried to warn you, Templeton.

316
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,119
You're in the corporate jungle now.

317
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,580
The only thing you can trust
is your own success,

318
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,957
and even that can stab you in the back.

319
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,292
Try it, Success!

320
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,503
[both sigh]

321
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,837
Don't feel too bad.

322
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:44,008
I'm sure your back wasn't the first one
stabbed today, and it won't be the last.

323
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,720
Chief Exec! Chief Exec! Chief... Hey!

324
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,015
Chip, you rot! All your work was mine!

325
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,767
We had an alliance, bro!

326
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,650
Since when are you alliance buddies
with Chip?

327
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,729
I thought we were working together.

328
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:57,980
Not cool, Amal!

329
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,109
- [Amal] See? It wasn't just me!
- [Chip] Don't blame me for everything!

330
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,443
[all arguing]

331
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,362
It has begun.

332
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,364
[panting]

333
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:11,327
Boss Baby! My partners all betrayed me,
but they didn't take my notes.

334
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,498
- Maybe you and I could form an...
- No! Scat! Get out of here, Simmons!

335
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,809
We're still high up on the leaderboard,

336
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,671
and all the corporate zombies
are gonna want a piece of our brains.

337
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,006
Don't let them eat my shot at being CEO.

338
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,592
Templeton, double time
on the stinkless chemistry.

339
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,886
And get me back to mini golf.

340
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,763
Staci, take Jimbo with you.

341
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,807
- The moment has come.
- [Staci cackles]

342
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,890
[Jimbo gasps]

343
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,767
Wait. What is Staci...?

344
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,979
Just making sure you and I
can work without interference.

345
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,940
Keep them fighting, keep them panicked.

346
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,359
Just keep them away from the Boss and Tim.

347
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,213
- Come on, now! We had an agreement.
- You started it!

348
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,637
- How could you?
- [blows raspberry]

349
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,742
Staci. Hey. I see Double B's
riding second right behind Chip.

350
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,786
I'm thinking,
if your team partnered up with me...

351
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,705
No! Your team and me!

352
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:56,997
[snaps fingers]

353
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,333
[gasping]

354
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,421
[gasps] Chip's stealing your work again?

355
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,050
What? I did not! But I totally would.

356
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,427
Eat chemistry, Chip!

357
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,137
[grunting]

358
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,767
- [Templeton] Yes! We got three more!
- [monitor beeping]

359
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:21,189
What? Boss Baby's team solved
Dirty Diaper and Stanky Blankie?

360
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,900
I am still stuck on my second stink!

361
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,359
I must know his secrets!

362
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,530
Mad Dog Phil smells an opportunity
to piggyback on others' success!

363
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,615
[gasps]

364
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,702
They're hungry for ideas,
and have none of their own!

365
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,079
It's a corporate zombie invasion!

366
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,164
[both gasp]

367
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,875
[all groaning, snarling]

368
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,546
How do we stop them?

369
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:52,470
What? All of you want me to sabotage
the hard work of Security Baby Katja?

370
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,265
I will teach you the price of betrayal!

371
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,475
[all gasping]

372
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,268
Uncle's breath!

373
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,313
[retching]

374
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,568
I claim all your research
as the spoils of war!

375
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,029
- Hey!
- No fair!

376
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,698
You just made the mad dog rabid!

377
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,825
[howls]

378
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,704
[screaming]

379
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,997
[panting] Ha!

380
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,373
[grunts]

381
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,585
- [roars] I'm angry!
- [gasps]

382
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:25,836
[grunts]

383
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,004
[yells]

00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,467
- [yelling]

[all yelling]

387
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,099
Are you sure you want to win like this?

388
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,727
Trust me,
it'll all be worth it once I'm CEO.

389
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,521
It's been too long.

390
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,856
I need to check in at mini golf,
and you should too.

391
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,776
It's the final 40 minutes.
Everything's on the line.

392
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,445
And Mom and Dad aren't going to believe
you're napping forever.

393
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,573
I'm telling you, we need to do this.

394
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,199
Do you not even trust me anymore?

395
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,535
[sighs] Five minutes.

396
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,912
Whatever we need to do,
you get us back here, ASAP.

397
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,100
- [Mom] There you two are!
- [baby coos]

398
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,794
Did-did you not work
on your golf holes at all?

399
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,546
I guess we were too busy playing.

400
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,549
Well, Gigantic Rapids is ready to swing.

401
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,802
Come on, grab your club.
We'll do Magma Madness later.

402
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,639
Is it a long course?

403
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,976
[chuckles] If I know your dad,
it's gonna be brutal.

404
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,730
The Gator Moat of Croco-Death alone
is a solid 20 minutes.

405
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,025
I rented a real iguana.
Fair warning, he's a biter.

406
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,652
What if I only have five minutes?

407
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,570
[laughs]

408
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,574
You're a kid. You've got nothing
but free time. Let's golf!

409
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,746
[growls]

410
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,332
Mom, Dad.

411
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:51,464
- I... I don't want to play mini golf.
- [Dad] What?

412
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,090
I thought you loved it.

413
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,969
I do love spending time with you guys.

414
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,889
And I know you both love mini golf.

415
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:05,353
But I guess maybe I outgrew it.

416
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,856
Sorry, Tim. I wish you'd have told us.

417
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:13,361
Okay. No more inside-the-house mini golf.

418
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,072
I guess we'll find other traditions.

419
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:19,950
Thank you, Templeton.

420
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,827
You're the one person
I can always count on.

421
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,163
I told them I hated mini golf.

422
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,083
I love mini golf!

423
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,294
- Templeton, I... I didn't intend to...
- Let's go crack your stupid serum,

424
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,880
so I never have to think
about this day again.

425
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,343
[whimpering]

426
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,719
[babies shouting]

427
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,264
[timer beeping]

428
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,101
Pencils down. No time to test it.

429
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,435
What do we call this one?

430
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,062
Golf Slayer.

431
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,855
Templeton.

432
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:59,073
It's no inside-the-house family mini golf,
but it's the best I can do.

433
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,910
Come on, I guarantee you a hole in one.

434
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,377
[Boss] Boom, baby.

435
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,129
I hope you get the job.

436
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,802
This day was a rollercoaster ride,
right down to the fear, the adrenaline,

437
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,097
and the flying chunks of goop everywhere.

438
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,476
But my fears have been allayed
and my hopes rewarded.

439
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,396
I am over the moon with excitement,

440
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:37,445
bursting at the seams because Baby Corp
once more has its Stinkless Serum!

441
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,904
- No way!
- [all gasping]

442
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,364
[baby] Amazing!

443
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,202
Do you think it was us? No, probably not.
Impossible. Maybe? Gah!

444
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,162
Just spill it!

445
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:53,085
Congratulations to our winner,
the next CEO of Baby Corp...

446
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,212
Boss Baby!

447
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,049
Boss! You're the boss, Boss Baby!

448
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,718
I'm the CEO?

449
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,388
- I'm the CEO! [laughs]
- [cheering]

450
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,556
I did it!

451
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,726
- I'm happy you got what you wanted.
- [laughter continues]

452
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,937
[Turtleneck] Celebrate today, Boss Baby!

453
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,149
We'll make it official
with the Board of Directors tomorrow.

454
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,484
[cheering continues]

455
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,071
Sorry, buddy. You know it's my nature.

456
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,656
Hey, I respect the game.

457
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,203
- You're not partying with us?
- I had to write a letter to my brother.

458
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,580
- Want me to give it to him?
- Nah.

459
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,082
I'll just leave it
on his new CEO desk for tomorrow.

460
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,626
Don't want to step on his big day.

461
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,587
- You're a good brother, Tim.
- Thanks.

462
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,381
It's been fun working with you, Jimbo.
Maybe I'll see you around.

463
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,635
- Huh? Where are you going?
- I'm quitting the field team.

464
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,263
What?

465
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:52,812
Hello? Miss, um, Turtleneck Superstar CEO
Still-For-Now Baby?

466
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,273
I'm just leaving something for my brother
to read when he moves in.

467
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,358
Huh?

468
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,863
Intervention! [yells]

469
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,032
You are not quitting our field team!

470
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,826
We don't accept this letter!

471
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,702
That's not my letter.

472
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,955
It was already on the CEO's desk.

473
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:17,503
"Come and get her. X-O-X-O..."
[gasps] "Fred"!

474
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,922
I think Estes kidnapped Turtleneck!

475
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,340
But what does it mean?

476
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,883
It means war.

477
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,430
Yeah! [laughs]

478
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:33,394
[sings tune]

479
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,731
Inappropriate for the moment.

480
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,692
Yes, I can see that now.
