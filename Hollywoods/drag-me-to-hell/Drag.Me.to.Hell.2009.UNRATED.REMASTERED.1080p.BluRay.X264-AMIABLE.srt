1
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,515
No!

2
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:28,482
No!

3
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,217
Repeat
the following phrases

4
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,636
precisely as spoken.

5
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:48,098
There is no friction
with the proper diction.

6
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,601
There is no
friction with the proper diction.

7
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,605
Good sounds
abound when the mouth is round.

8
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:59,319
Good sounds abound
when the mouth is round.

9
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,572
Round.

10
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,345
I think we can make this work.

11
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,472
I'll call you this
afternoon and let you know.

12
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:29,556
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

13
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,017
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

14
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,310
- Thank you.
- Have a great day.

15
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:34,144
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you, too.

16
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,103
Have a good day.

17
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,314
Thank you. Bye.

18
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,410
Here you go, Mr. Jacks.

19
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,372
Thank you.

20
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:55,333
Mr. Jacks?

21
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,336
I was wondering if you'd
made any decision regarding

22
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,380
the assistant manager's position.

23
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,090
Oh, well, I'm still deciding,

24
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,884
and right now, it's
between Stu and yourself.

25
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,177
Stu Rubin, the new guy?

26
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,011
Well, I know he's new,

27
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:11,056
but he's also quite
aggressive, and we like that.

28
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,516
You know, Stu's someone who's not afraid

29
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:15,727
to crunch the numbers and
make the tough decisions.

30
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,355
I'm perfectly capable of
making the tough decisions.

31
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,774
I'll let you know as soon as I decide.

32
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:21,567
Okay?

33
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,777
In the meantime, take him through

34
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:28,281
our loan qualifying procedures,
just in case, all right?

35
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,075
Okay.

36
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,452
Oh, and
would you mind taking

37
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,995
your lunch break now?

38
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:34,996
Sure.

39
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,039
And maybe on your way back,

40
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,208
you could pick me up a turkey club?

41
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,544
Turkey club, excellent choice.

42
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:41,628
You mind picking one up for me?

43
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,422
Thanks.

44
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,091
And spicy mustard.

45
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,717
- What have you got?
- Get your approval on this?

46
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,094
This is the loan we talked

47
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:49,928
about before.
- Oh, the loan.

48
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:50,721
Exactly.

49
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:52,889
Big one, huh?

50
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,723
1.5.

51
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:57,103
Absolutely, it'll be one of many.

52
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,063
Well, Professor,

53
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:02,566
congratulations on making
it through your first week.

54
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,609
Thank you very much.

55
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,861
Mm.

56
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:08,029
Thought you'd
have a full beard by now.

57
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,072
So did I.

58
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:10,615
I'm a little disappointed.

59
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:11,783
Oh, man, this thing.

60
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,452
That's it. I'm done.

61
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:14,245
I'm out.

62
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:17,914
Chris, don't even bother.

63
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,374
I gotta get a new one.

64
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,709
I'm telling you, you're
gonna drive yourself nuts.

65
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,839
It's completely broken.

66
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,884
Was broken.

67
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:32,346
You are cocky and sexy and unbelievable.

68
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,266
I almost forgot.

69
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,268
Found it at the bank.

70
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,479
What is this?

71
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,439
No way!

72
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,524
Wow, it's a 1929 Standing Liberty,

73
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,568
and it's almost fully struck.

74
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,445
You found this in regular
circulation at the bank?

75
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,488
I did.

76
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:53,617
I'm gonna add this to
my nerdy coin collection.

77
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:54,910
- Okay.
- Thank you, baby.

78
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,329
Thanks for thinking of me.

79
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,122
All right.

80
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,081
- Bye.
- Bye.

81
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,628
- See you later.
- I'll see you later, okay?

82
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:05,462
Dr. Dalton.

83
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,714
- Hello, dear.
- Oh, hi, Mom.

84
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,090
What are you doing?

85
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,675
Christine just came
over, brought some lunch, and

86
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:11,885
I'm correcting some papers.
- Christine?

87
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,220
Oh, the one from the farm?

88
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:14,888
Yeah, Mom, the
girl I've been dating

89
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,766
for almost a year, the girl
who's coming for dinner.

90
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:18,725
We're still on for dinner?
- I'm sure she's

91
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:19,643
a very sweet girl.

92
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:20,477
She is.

93
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,561
I can't wait for you to--
- But, you know, your father

94
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,855
and I just have certain
expectations for you.

95
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:24,689
I can't really do

96
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,815
the expectations.
- I understand Amy Kulick is

97
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,567
looking for someone to play tennis with.

98
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,902
- Yeah, I.
- You know, she graduated

99
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,612
from Yale Law with honors,

100
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,864
and she's a very successful attorney now.

101
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,366
I know. You told me.

102
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,617
Yeah, that's the kind of girl

103
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,494
I would love to see you with.

104
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,787
- Mother--
- She's the kind of woman

105
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:41,706
who could really help you socially

106
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,625
and, as a result, in your career.

107
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,501
And that's the kind of thing

108
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,794
you should be thinking about now.

109
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:46,836
Mother, I don't wanna--

110
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,171
You can't be playing around

111
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,798
with little girls off the farm.

112
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,632
I think you're
really gonna like--

113
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:54,428
It's time to
really find a partner.

114
00:09:57,557 --> 00:10:01,434
Mm, Christine, you messed up my order.

115
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,061
No, I didn't.

116
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,939
Yeah, I said no mayo.

117
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,693
You never said that.

118
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:12,195
Know what? Don't sweat it.

119
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:12,989
It's okay.

120
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,840
Mr. Jacks, by the
way, aren't you a Laker fan?

121
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:32,882
I am a Laker fan.

122
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,426
My mom is having this thing on Sunday.

123
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,385
I can't use these.

124
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:36,553
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

125
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:37,804
Absolutely, you want them?
- These are great seats!

126
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:38,680
They are great seats.

127
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:39,514
This is where they bring

128
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:40,682
the hot dogs right to you.
- Yes, it is.

129
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,142
You are gonna hobnob with celebs.

130
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,101
You sure that's okay?

131
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,227
Absolutely, it's okay.

132
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,228
Yeah.
- Well, thank you, Stu.

133
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,813
Take them. Absolutely.

134
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,692
Say hey to Kobe for me.
- Of course.

135
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,905
Will you help me?

136
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:56,656
Of course.

137
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:57,699
What can I do for you?

138
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,993
Your trucks are at my house.

139
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:04,331
The men are packing all
my things, private things.

140
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:06,708
Please, make them stop.

141
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:13,381
Mrs.--

142
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,341
Ganush.

143
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,137
Mrs. Ganush, the bank is
informing you of their intent

144
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:22,849
to repossess your property
at 325 Brandon Street today.

145
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,728
But this is my home for 30 years.

146
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:30,983
And I make every payment until
the sickness took my eye.

147
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,652
I hope to have more money soon.

148
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:36,321
I just need a little more time.

149
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,572
You--
- I don't think my manager's

150
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,367
going to extend you any more credit.

151
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:41,409
Oh.

152
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,870
Please.

153
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:44,997
Won't you try?

154
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,503
Okay.

155
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:52,463
Bless you.

156
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,882
Bless you!

157
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,264
We have an elderly woman
asking for an extension

158
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,350
on her mortgage payment.

159
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,351
She's on a fixed income,

160
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,937
and she's had some medical problems.

161
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:12,983
There's gotta be something
we can do to help her.

162
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,407
Well, apparently, we've already granted

163
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,158
her two extensions.

164
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,868
And, you know, on this
type of foreclosure,

165
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,037
we seize the trapped equity

166
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,665
and the bank makes a
sizable amount in fees.

167
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,917
We would have to throw
her out of her house.

168
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,878
It's a tough decision.

169
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:34,839
Your call.

170
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,575
I'll take care of it.

171
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,220
Mrs. Ganush.

172
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,555
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ganush,

173
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,391
but another extension on the
loan is out of the question.

174
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,309
What?

175
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,102
I would like to help,
but it is in the bank's--

176
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,355
No, please, this is my home.

177
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,816
Where will I live?

178
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,526
You list your
granddaughter as a reference.

179
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,652
Maybe you could stay with her.

180
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,697
I would not burden her.

181
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,241
And there are several fine
assisted living facilities

182
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,368
for the elderly.
- A nursing home?

183
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:51,165
No, I would never live
in one of those places.

184
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,959
I'm really sorry.

185
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,070
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

186
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:25,115
and never have I begged for anything.

187
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,078
But now, I beg for you.

188
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,956
I humble myself before you.
- Mrs. Ganush, Mrs. Ganush,

189
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,917
please, please stand up.
- I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

190
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,546
On my mother's grave, I beg you!

191
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,463
Please let go.

192
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,422
Let go!

193
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,507
Security!

194
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,383
Stop!

195
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,302
Over here, Billy!

196
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,763
Over here!
- We're coming.

197
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:57,857
You shame me.

198
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,953
I beg you, and you shame me.

199
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,624
I think your business
is finished here, ma'am.

200
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,418
Let's go.

201
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,383
Mrs. Ganush.

202
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,771
Go, ma'am.

203
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,316
Let's go.

204
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,489
I never saw anything
quite like that before.

205
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,533
Are you okay?

206
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:55,122
You handled that just right, you know.

207
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,132
Good night.

208
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,133
See you tomorrow.

209
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,344
Okay.

210
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,432
You know, I just finished
going over this McPherson loan.

211
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,101
This is very impressive work.

212
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:17,936
Thanks.

213
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,479
Would you mind taking this home tonight

214
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,438
and finishing it up?

215
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:21,731
Because I would like to show it

216
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,775
to the regional veep in the morning.

217
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:24,943
I would love to.

218
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,945
- Great.
- Thank you.

219
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:31,449
Oh, and as far as that
assistant manager's position goes,

220
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,869
you're at the top of the list.

221
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:28,901
You shamed me.

222
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,196
I beat you, you old bitch!

223
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,017
No!

224
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:36,713
Lamia.

225
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,109
Soon it will be you who
comes begging to me.

226
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:29,932
She's right over there.

227
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,435
Thank you, thank you.

228
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,228
Hey.

229
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,401
Once they send some officers
over to have a talk with her,

230
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,902
she's not gonna be
bothering you anymore, okay?

231
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,404
So don't even think about her.

232
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,989
And I'm gonna call Mr.
Jacks and just make sure

233
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,283
he can have somebody walk you
to your car every night, okay?

234
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,201
Okay.

235
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,871
Just thank God you're okay.

236
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,789
You are okay, right?

237
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,666
I'm fine.

238
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,835
What?

239
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,837
What's the matter?

240
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,131
It's just that

241
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:04,633
maybe I could have gotten her
another extension on her loan.

242
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,010
Chris, no, don't do that.

243
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,011
You said the bank granted

244
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,347
this woman two extensions already, right?

245
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,639
I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage,

246
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,474
you lose your house.

247
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,808
What does this woman expect?

248
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,101
It's not your fault.

249
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,394
You can't beat yourself up over it.

250
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,546
What is it?

251
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,672
What's wrong?

252
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,883
Did you hear that?

253
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,093
What?

254
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,804
Really? You didn't?

255
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
No.

256
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:51,973
What?

257
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,561
I know this is gonna sound weird,

258
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:00,398
but I wanna get my fortune read.

259
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,401
Now?

260
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:04,694
Are you kidding?

261
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:06,987
Come on, Chris.

262
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,823
I'll read your fortune for you.

263
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:11,242
Mm, in the near future, we
are gonna get in the car,

264
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,076
go home, and relax.
- Clay, I really want

265
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:12,953
to do this.

266
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,206
Why, because of what
happened with that old woman?

267
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:21,336
Chris, I really think we
should just get you home now.

268
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,964
Can you do this for me?

269
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:36,183
Pray to God none of
my students see me here.

270
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,685
The only class I'll be able to teach is,

271
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,312
like, Hypocrisy 101.

272
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,108
Hm, so many things to choose from here.

273
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,609
Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,

274
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,945
which is a weird little dried monkey head.

275
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,697
Oh, wait, no, never mind, he's got one.

276
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,825
Shh.

277
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,619
I am Rham Jas, seer.

278
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,205
I'm Christine and this is Clay.

279
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,498
You probably already knew that, right?

280
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,336
Just kidding.

281
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,504
How can I help you?

282
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,882
I would like to have my fortune read.

283
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:09,258
Can you do that?

284
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,261
I have the ability to
see certain energies.

285
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,973
Sometimes these energies are
a foretoken of things to come.

286
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,308
$60, please.

287
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,434
Seriously?

288
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:19,268
Yes.

289
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,769
60.

290
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,938
Doesn't that seem a little
steep for this sort of thing?

291
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,817
If you're not serious, please go.

292
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:27,818
All right. Come on, Chris.

293
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:28,777
Wait, wait.

294
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,446
I'll pay.
- Oh.

295
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,447
No, you know what?

296
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:32,781
All right. I got it.

297
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:33,575
I got it.

298
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,368
There you go.

299
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,536
Platinum card.

300
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,829
Very good.

301
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,420
Thank you.

302
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,421
Here. Here.

303
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,715
- Thanks.
- Sure.

304
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,093
Ah, ah.

305
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:53,887
Please.

306
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,850
So, you wish to know
something of your destiny.

307
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,143
- Yes.
- Very good.

308
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,770
Let's see what the fates have in store.

309
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,230
You know, Freud
said destiny was not

310
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,148
an act of fate, but
rather something created

311
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,692
by our subconscious to
control our conscious choices.

312
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:09,944
That's true.

313
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,153
But we cannot attempt to understand

314
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,864
the world by intellect alone.

315
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,407
Oh, Carl Jung.

316
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:19,120
Yes, from his treatise
Psychological Types.

317
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,913
So--

318
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,457
Jung, New Agers' favorite psychologist.

319
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,876
Because he wasn't afraid to
bring God into the equation.

320
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,336
Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God--

321
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:28,629
- Clay, Clay, come on.
- Let's do it.

322
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,797
I know. Come on.

323
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:30,714
Let's start.

324
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:31,674
Shall we?

325
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:32,800
I'm ready.

326
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:35,553
Well, please, give me your hand.

327
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,554
Okay.

328
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:37,388
This way.

329
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,181
Okay.

330
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,731
You work with money.

331
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,067
That's right.

332
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:54,947
And you've
recently lost something.

333
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,740
No, I don't think so.

334
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,284
No.

335
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:01,370
No, you haven't lost anything.

336
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:04,707
But something's been taken from you.

337
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,500
No.

338
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:07,626
A button.

339
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,836
Oh, my God.

340
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,296
Yes.

341
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,006
Well, anyone can see
she's missing a button.

342
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,465
So what?
- Clay, it was really strange.

343
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,093
The old woman today, she
took a button from my sleeve.

344
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,136
Why would she do that?

345
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:20,265
You would both please just be quiet.

346
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,421
I think that's enough for tonight.

347
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:35,798
What's wrong?

348
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:39,301
I'm tired, and I see
it's become quite late.

349
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,470
I will, of course, refund your money.

350
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,554
Wait, wait, wait!

351
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,349
Did you see something?

352
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,184
A dark spirit has come upon you.

353
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,310
What do you mean?

354
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,645
- Well, he's--
- Did you blaspheme the dead

355
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,896
while visiting a graveyard?

356
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:51,730
No!

357
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,856
Did you play with a Ouija board

358
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,775
or consort with those who
practice the black arts?

359
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:55,776
All right, take it easy, man.

360
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:56,860
Come on.
- Wait, Clay, Clay, Clay.

361
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,238
No. No, I didn't.

362
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,198
Perhaps someone has cursed you.

363
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,540
Then how did he know all that?

364
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,167
Know what, that you lost a button?

365
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,794
And by the way, he didn't
really know that much.

366
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,170
He makes a couple of good guesses,

367
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,463
then he stirs you up,

368
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,799
and then he leaves you
with all these questions

369
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,427
and, conveniently, his business card.

370
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:25,013
Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.

371
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,515
But he didn't want the money.

372
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,225
He tried to give it back, remember?

373
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:29,852
Well, he sort of tried,

374
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,981
but in the end, he took it, didn't he?

375
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:35,984
I guess so.

376
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:01,967
I gotta go meet the guy
that's towing your car,

377
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:02,843
so you gonna be okay?

378
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:03,802
- Yeah.
- All right.

379
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,304
Kitty, take care of her.

380
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,138
I'll see you in about an hour.

381
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,014
Love you.
- Okay.

382
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:07,807
Okay.

383
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,869
Here, put that on your lip.

384
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,745
- Thank you.
- I can't believe

385
00:33:58,746 --> 00:33:59,746
she came to the house.

386
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:00,706
This is so nuts.

387
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:01,748
I'm calling the cops.

388
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,417
It wasn't her.

389
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:05,085
Who was it then?

390
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:07,045
I don't know, I couldn't see who it was.

391
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,296
Of course it was her, had to be her.

392
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:10,424
No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!

393
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,466
It was somebody.

394
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,592
Chris, it had to be somebody.

395
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,136
The lights were out, you
just couldn't see who it was,

396
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,220
but I'm guessing it was--
- Clay, there wasn't

397
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,264
anybody here.

398
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,809
Then who did this?

399
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,730
Who hit you in the face?

400
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,190
Huh?

401
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:31,862
I think it's just a reaction

402
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:33,697
to her being attacked earlier in the day.

403
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:36,116
Yeah, classic symptoms
of post-traumatic stress.

404
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,117
Yeah, she's showing signs

405
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,661
of panic and paranoia, so.

406
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,871
Want me to walk you out, man?

407
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,122
No, no, no, no, I'm fine.

408
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,248
All right.

409
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:47,962
Oh, hey, hey.

410
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,256
How you doing?

411
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,549
- Better.
- Yeah?

412
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,843
Especially after the
doctor explained it to me.

413
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,179
He said that victims of violence, they--

414
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,556
Re-experience their trauma.

415
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:03,894
I misinterpreted it to be
something more than it was.

416
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,479
Happens.

417
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,023
I just, I feel...

418
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,567
- What?
- Kind of embarrassed.

419
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:11,485
Are you kidding?

420
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,611
No.

421
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:16,698
You never have to be embarrassed with me.

422
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:17,492
Okay?

423
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,040
Hey, listen, I was thinking
maybe we could take

424
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,334
a little trip on Saturday,

425
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:29,086
get on the train and go to Santa Barbara.

426
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,212
Your folks' cabin.

427
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:31,338
Yeah, if you're
up for it, the cabin.

428
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,839
Oh, my God, I would love to!

429
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,924
Yeah? Oh, good.

430
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:34,758
That'd be so exciting.

431
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,551
Oh, baby, you're gonna love it.

432
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:37,969
You're gonna love it, I'm
excited for you to see.

433
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,804
There's trees

434
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,430
and it's private.
- That would be great.

435
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:41,264
It'll be great.

436
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,099
It'll be good.

437
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,100
I think we need to.

438
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:46,729
And we can just, we can
just talk and stuff.

439
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,108
What?

440
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,278
What's the matter?

441
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,989
I couldn't wake up.

442
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:03,865
It's okay.

443
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:04,991
Okay.

444
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,201
Come here.

445
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:10,122
Was just a dream.

446
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:20,882
Oh, baby, that's the rental car

447
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,801
they dropped off this morning.

448
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:23,635
Okay?
- Thanks.

449
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,303
Sure.

450
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,263
Love you.

451
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:27,473
Love you too.

452
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:33,312
Hey, baby, try not to piss
off any old ladies today, okay?

453
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,207
Hey, Christine?

454
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,458
What, are you just getting here?

455
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:56,668
What are you, the hall monitor?

456
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,920
Ha, ha, very funny, Christine.

457
00:38:58,921 --> 00:38:59,879
Oh.

458
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,840
What's this?

459
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,883
What do you want?

460
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:07,972
I need you to finish teaching
me the loan procedures.

461
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,015
I've got a lot on my mind.

462
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,975
Can we do this tomorrow?

463
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,435
- Sure.
- Okay.

464
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:14,602
I'll just tell Mr. Jacks

465
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:15,603
that you don't have the time right now.

466
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,814
Maybe he can tell me.
- No, no!

467
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,482
Okay, I'll do it.

468
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,234
Okay.

469
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:25,405
We were going over the
asset-based lending guidelines.

470
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,323
Right.

471
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:27,866
Let's say your client is a company

472
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:30,535
that can't get traditional bank financing.

473
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,839
And?

474
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,801
Uh, and.

475
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,097
And?

476
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:53,434
And.

477
00:39:56,562 --> 00:40:00,191
And get your filthy pig
knuckle off my desk!

478
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,449
Christine Blood.

479
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,825
Brown.

480
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,535
Christine.

481
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,329
Your nose.

482
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,456
Uh, sure, can you hold?

483
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:17,290
Let me help you.

484
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,291
No, no, I've got it under control.

485
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:19,709
Oh, my God!

486
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,586
Oh, my God!

487
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,046
Oh, God!

488
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,047
Oh, my God!

489
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,590
Stop it!

490
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,966
Mr. Jacks!

491
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,009
- Did I get any in my mouth?
- Mr. Jacks--

492
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,303
- Oh, my God!
- Did I get any in my mouth?

493
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,097
Let me take you over here to get clean.

494
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,057
- I'm so sorry!
- Why did you do that?

495
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:35,683
Oh, my God!

496
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:36,643
What was that about?

497
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,269
- It's just a nosebleed.
- Disgusting, ugh!

498
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,938
Did I get any in my mouth?

499
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:40,772
We'll clean you up.

500
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:41,773
We have antiseptic.

501
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,818
There's blood everywhere.

502
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,120
What is it?

503
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:40,748
Hi.

504
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,041
I came to see Sylvia Ganush.

505
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,543
Is she here?

506
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:45,962
Who are you?

507
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,840
I'm a friend of hers.

508
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:50,426
Someone--
- Wait.

509
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:56,139
I know who you are.

510
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,099
Grandma told me you would come.

511
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,603
You are the woman from the bank,
the one who took her house.

512
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:03,313
Actually, it was the
bank that took the house.

513
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,899
I mean, I just work there.

514
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,402
In fact, I tried to help your
grandma get the house back,

515
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,070
but my boss wouldn't let me.

516
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,364
Are you going to stand here on my porch

517
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,909
and lie to my face?

518
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:21,915
No.

519
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:25,628
You used to be a real
fat girl, didn't you?

520
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:32,592
Yeah.

521
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:33,636
I can tell.

522
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:37,514
You are not welcome here.

523
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:38,848
Wait!

524
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:40,433
Wait, I need to see her.

525
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:42,310
I need her to forgive me.

526
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,645
And I'll get her the house back.

527
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:45,730
And you're gonna make
everything all right for her,

528
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:46,606
is that it?

529
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:47,399
Yes.

530
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,152
Come on.

531
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,127
Where is she?

532
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,431
Get her off me!

533
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:02,473
Get her off me!
- Come!

534
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:03,350
Don't look.

535
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,477
Grab her shoulder.

536
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:07,979
No, no, lift her up!

537
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:16,529
Be careful.

538
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,157
Let's roll the dice!

539
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:23,745
Still going to make
everything all right for her?

540
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,205
You deserve everything
that is coming to you.

541
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:37,925
I believe what plagues you is the Lamia.

542
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:40,303
Lamia, that's the
word the old woman used.

543
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:41,721
The Black Goat,

544
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:45,099
only summoned by gypsies
for their darkest deeds.

545
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,225
For the first three days,

546
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:48,436
the Lamia appears as a nasty spirit

547
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:50,647
that torments its victim.

548
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:53,608
After that, it reveals itself
to be a taker of souls,

549
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:56,152
and it comes for the owner
of the accursed object.

550
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:56,986
Accursed object.

551
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:57,820
What object?

552
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:01,950
Something taken from the
victim, cursed and given back.

553
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:05,954
This?

554
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:09,999
What if I just burn it?

555
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,503
I'm afraid no matter what
condition the button is in,

556
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:15,338
you would still be the owner.

557
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:17,423
The Lamia would still come to take you.

558
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:19,050
Take me where?

559
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,183
Then how do I get rid of this?

560
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:30,019
You could attempt to appease the spirit.

561
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,854
The simplest way would
be a blood offering.

562
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:35,942
A small creature could be
sacrificed, a chicken perhaps.

563
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:36,776
No way!

564
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,069
Look, I'm a vegetarian.

565
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,030
I volunteer at the puppy
shelter, for Christ's sake.

566
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:43,241
I don't go around killing animals.

567
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:45,118
You will be surprised
what you'll be willing to do

568
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,496
when the Lamia comes for you.

569
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,625
This will show you how.

570
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:08,726
Hi!

571
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,579
Here, kitty, kitty.

572
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:20,393
Chris?

573
00:50:20,394 --> 00:50:22,812
Chris?

574
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:23,605
Chris?

575
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:27,358
Hey, there you are.

576
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,734
What you doing out here?

577
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,568
Baby, I called the bank.

578
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:30,403
They said you left early.

579
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:32,530
You're not answering my calls.

580
00:50:32,531 --> 00:50:33,657
Is that blood?

581
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:37,910
No.

582
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:39,453
Why would there be blood?

583
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:42,540
Yeah, baby, there's
blood on your sleeve.

584
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:43,541
- Oh.
- Are you bleeding?

585
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:46,544
No, um, it was just tomato juice.

586
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:48,879
I was cutting a tomato in the kitchen

587
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,925
and it must have gotten on my sleeve.

588
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:57,431
Hey, Chris, why don't we
do this dinner another time?

589
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,433
You've had a rough couple of days.

590
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:01,267
I think it's better.

591
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:03,477
No, I want to go to the dinner.

592
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:07,607
I know, but are you sure
you're feeling all right?

593
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,819
Honestly, I haven't been.

594
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:21,204
But I think that everything
is gonna be okay now.

595
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:25,375
I really do.

596
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:31,882
What do you think?

597
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:37,261
You look beautiful.

598
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:42,433
God, it's such a nice day.

599
00:51:42,434 --> 00:51:43,768
It really is.

600
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:47,146
God, it's gonna be nice inside too.

601
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:51,026
They're gonna love you.

602
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:55,488
- Clayton.
- Hello, Mother.

603
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:56,864
Good to see you, this is Christine.

604
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:57,990
That's my mom, Trudy.

605
00:51:57,991 --> 00:51:58,866
Hello, Christine.

606
00:51:58,867 --> 00:51:59,742
Hello.

607
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:01,577
It's very nice to meet you.

608
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:02,536
Oh. Well.

609
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:03,537
Please, come in.

610
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:04,331
Come in.

611
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:06,373
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, son.

612
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:08,584
How are you? Good to see you, sir.

613
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:10,377
This is Christine, Christine,
this is my dad, Leonard.

614
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:11,295
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi, Maria.

615
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,713
Thank you.
- You have a beautiful home.

616
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:16,008
Oh, well, thank you very much.

617
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:16,884
Can I get you a drink?

618
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:17,718
Yeah, wine?

619
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,136
Do you guys want?
- Sure.

620
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,305
Okay, come help me.

621
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,224
- I'll be right back.
- Mm-hm.

622
00:52:23,225 --> 00:52:24,183
I'll take a Chardonnay!

623
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,727
Yes, dear.

624
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:27,686
I hope you don't mind.

625
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,438
Oh, how thoughtful.

626
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:30,272
Homemade?

627
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:31,232
Yes.

628
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:34,151
And what type of cake
would you call that?

629
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:37,364
Uh, it's called a, um, harvest cake.

630
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:42,660
Is that something you
would make on a farm?

631
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:43,453
No.

632
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:47,123
I mean, not anymore.

633
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:50,502
We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.

634
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:52,753
Geese?

635
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:54,421
Well, right around the harvest time,

636
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:58,217
that's when your goose eggs
will make a real dense yolk.

637
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:00,011
Makes for a rich cake.

638
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:02,513
Mm.

639
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:04,307
Well, just, thank you.

640
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:06,517
- Here we are.
- Sorry to interrupt

641
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:07,893
the bonding sesh.

642
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:09,186
Why don't you join
us in the dining room?

643
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:10,020
- Yeah, let's go.
- Yeah.

644
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:10,855
Okay.

645
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:11,939
It's right in here.

646
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:14,275
Whoa, jeez.

647
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:15,068
Hecuba.

648
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,862
Never did understand that damned animal.

649
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:18,779
Hate cats.

650
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,281
That is so strange.

651
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:22,491
Hecuba is usually very sweet.

652
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:23,659
Oh, that's okay.

653
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,493
I had a cat.

654
00:53:24,494 --> 00:53:25,995
I understand.

655
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:28,123
You mean you have a cat.

656
00:53:31,168 --> 00:53:32,334
Unless something happened to him.

657
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,424
Well, how am I supposed to know?

658
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:39,425
I mean, you know how cats are.

659
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:41,219
They come and they go.

660
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:45,974
That's true.

661
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,102
- Well.
- Well.

662
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:52,313
Yes. Yes, please.

663
00:53:52,314 --> 00:53:54,690
So, how's the coin collection, son?

664
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:55,733
That's my dad's way of saying,

665
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:56,984
"So, you're still a huge nerd?"

666
00:53:57,819 --> 00:53:58,736
It's good. It's good.

667
00:53:58,737 --> 00:53:59,695
In fact, Christine just got me

668
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:01,989
a 1929 Standing Liberty
quarter at her bank.

669
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,073
- Really?
- Isn't that crazy?

670
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:04,158
Yeah, it's rare.

671
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:05,201
Oh, I just think the job

672
00:54:05,202 --> 00:54:07,494
of a bank teller must be so difficult,

673
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:09,914
with all that counting and repetition.

674
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:11,373
Must get very tedious.

675
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:14,543
Yes, you're right, but I'm not a teller.

676
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:15,544
- Oh?
- Yeah, Mom, I told you.

677
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:16,545
Christine's a loan officer.

678
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:17,838
- Ah.
- She handles all the loans

679
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,090
for small businesses
and homes for her bank.

680
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,760
And she's up for this big promotion, so.

681
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:23,802
Right, Chris?

682
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:25,846
If I could close this one
account that I'm working on,

683
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,181
it would really help.

684
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:29,225
Well, that must be
a very important loan.

685
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:32,102
It's the biggest that my
branch has ever handled.

686
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:34,605
And how did that come to you?

687
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:37,066
Well, I was reading
the Wall Street Journal

688
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:39,235
and came across this
medical supply company

689
00:54:39,236 --> 00:54:42,738
that was looking to expand,
but didn't have the liquidity.

690
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:45,658
So I met with their CFO
and presented a formula

691
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:48,577
for restructuring some
of their long-term debt.

692
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:51,205
Sounds like you've got a
lot going for you, Christine.

693
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:54,333
Well, your mother must
be very proud of you.

694
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:55,293
I suppose.

695
00:55:01,508 --> 00:55:03,717
Uh, I don't see much of my mother.

696
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:04,551
Why is that?

697
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:07,221
Wow, Mom, that's, it's kind of personal.

698
00:55:07,222 --> 00:55:08,681
I'm speaking to Christine.

699
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:14,979
Uh, well, ever since my dad died,

700
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,107
um, she doesn't talk much.

701
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:19,317
She just, uh,

702
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:24,781
stays on the farm and
keeps to herself because...

703
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:27,366
Because?

704
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:29,493
Because her husband died, Mom,

705
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:31,245
and she just wants to be by herself.

706
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:32,079
Why don't--

707
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,958
Because my mother's an alcoholic.

708
00:55:36,126 --> 00:55:36,918
Oh.

709
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:39,546
I'm sorry.

710
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:44,633
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

711
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:48,721
Have to say, I find your
honesty very refreshing.

712
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:49,847
My father had a drinking problem,

713
00:55:49,848 --> 00:55:53,183
and I was always too ashamed to admit it.

714
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,811
You've got backbone.

715
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:57,479
Unlike that last girl he brought by.

716
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,023
What was her name?

717
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:00,024
- Alice.
- We don't have to--

718
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:00,858
Alicia!

719
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:01,692
- Alicia.
- Oh.

720
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:03,110
She was dreadful, Christine.

721
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:06,572
She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.

722
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:07,656
Well, they met on the internet.

723
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:08,532
There you go.
- Oh, what is that?

724
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:09,533
"They met on the internet"?

725
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:10,826
- Really?
- What does that mean?

726
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:12,161
Am I being too hard on him?

727
00:56:12,162 --> 00:56:13,620
- No, not at all.
- There you go.

728
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:14,705
Thank you very much.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

729
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:16,707
You know, I think I will try
some of that cake of yours.

730
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:17,708
- Toss me under the bus.
- Look at that.

731
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:19,001
It looks great, you're gonna like it.

732
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,837
Looks so interesting.

733
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:25,967
You only dislike it if
you hate delicious things.

734
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:39,104
Harvest cake, huh?

735
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:40,356
We have to get this recipe.
- It sounds so quaint,

736
00:56:40,357 --> 00:56:41,774
doesn't it?

737
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:44,109
Did you hear something?

738
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,110
No.

739
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:46,445
You okay?

740
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:47,654
Tasty.

741
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,573
- I like it a lot.
- I do like it.

742
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:50,908
- Mm-hm.
- Mm!

743
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:53,494
You know, Mom, when you
say we met on the internet,

744
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:54,787
it's a little misleading.

745
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,598
Well, you need to do that

746
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,225
to find a good mate.

747
00:57:16,226 --> 00:57:17,601
- She has a Facebook.
- You can't even trust

748
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:20,104
the things you hear or that
people write about themselves.

749
00:57:20,105 --> 00:57:21,230
- Very nice.
- Even the pictures are

750
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:22,272
false half the time.

751
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,066
Is that true?
- Oh, it's true.

752
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:25,901
I don't think it's a
misconception to think

753
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:28,862
that people of good breeding
and success should be able

754
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:32,866
to meet potential life partners
in a realistic situation.

755
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:44,504
Would you, Christine?

756
00:57:46,923 --> 00:57:47,923
No.

757
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:49,049
No, of course not.

758
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,008
What?

759
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,760
What, but we did.

760
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:53,053
We met at a bar, Chris.

761
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:53,929
What are you talking about?

762
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,556
Oh, my God, that's right.

763
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:57,141
You two better get
your stories straight.

764
00:57:57,142 --> 00:57:59,101
It's not a Klan rally, Mom.

765
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:00,394
It's a bar.

766
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:03,440
Yeah, we met at a bar,

767
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:05,691
and we set up the date on the internet.

768
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:08,861
You okay?

769
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:10,529
You okay?

770
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,613
Want water?

771
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:15,367
Baby, have some, went down the wrong pipe.

772
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,245
Oh, my God!

773
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,382
I'm sorry, I don't, uh,

774
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:32,926
there must be a window open.

775
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:34,386
Chris?

776
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:40,934
Okay, I hear you!

777
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:41,935
Leave me alone!

778
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,770
Just leave me the hell alone!

779
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:44,605
Stop it!

780
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:46,816
Baby, there's no one there.

781
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,028
Okay.

782
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,406
I think I'd better go.

783
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:57,618
Yes, I think that would be best.

784
00:58:57,619 --> 00:58:59,161
- Wait, Chris.
- Don't follow her.

785
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:00,537
She's a sick girl.

786
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:01,955
Mom, she needs my help.

787
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:02,999
Let her go.

788
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:07,669
Wait!

789
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,629
What's the matter?

790
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:12,466
Look, I did what you said!

791
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:14,593
I killed that little kitty!

792
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,428
You're so full of shit!

793
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:19,264
These are elusive and powerful
forces we are dealing with.

794
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:21,226
There are no guarantees!

795
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:42,246
We must speak directly
to this dark spirit.

796
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:47,084
We must dissuade it from
taking your soul, and soon.

797
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:48,627
I know someone who can help us.

798
00:59:48,628 --> 00:59:50,921
And I'm supposed to trust you?

799
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:53,090
Tomorrow is the third day.

800
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:55,300
After that, the Lamia will come for you.

801
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,344
We can't let that happen.

802
00:59:57,345 --> 00:59:59,429
But you must understand,

803
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:03,433
the woman who can help us must
put herself at great risk.

804
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,561
She will not do that for free.

805
01:00:05,562 --> 01:00:07,229
What do you need from me?

806
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,607
$10,000, cash, by tomorrow.

807
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:26,915
Mr. Jacks.

808
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,250
Yeah?

809
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:30,711
This is kind of awkward for me,

810
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:33,505
and I know it's not official yet,

811
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:35,924
but I was wondering if
I could get an advance

812
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:37,259
for the new position.

813
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,720
What, the assistant manager's position?

814
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:40,887
Yes.

815
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:44,349
See, one of my family
members is really sick.

816
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,018
They're not gonna die,

817
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:47,477
but they could.
- Christine, Christine.

818
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:49,271
There's a problem.

819
01:00:49,272 --> 01:00:52,107
The McPherson deal was
canceled last night.

820
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,067
What?
- Yeah.

821
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,028
Right after I informed the regional office

822
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:58,030
that we had this big loan pending,

823
01:00:58,031 --> 01:00:59,489
I find out that they just made their deal

824
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,658
over at First National.

825
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,702
Now, I gotta call in to
see what exactly happened,

826
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:06,288
but right now, this does not look

827
01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:09,166
too good for you or for me.

828
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:13,296
So, this assistant manager
promotion has been delayed.

829
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,048
In fact, you know, I think,

830
01:01:16,049 --> 01:01:17,633
with everything that's been happening,

831
01:01:17,634 --> 01:01:21,845
I think I'm gonna have
to give this job to Stu.

832
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:22,846
Stu.

833
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:23,640
I see.

834
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:25,474
I'm sorry.

835
01:01:25,475 --> 01:01:27,267
Look, if you've got family problems,

836
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:31,397
maybe you should take the
day off, sort them out and...

837
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:40,298
So, how much?

838
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,551
3,800 for everything.

839
01:02:42,552 --> 01:02:44,052
Including my jewelry?

840
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:45,095
Including.

841
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:48,223
But this stuff is worth
so much more than that.

842
01:02:48,224 --> 01:02:49,266
Please.

843
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:50,809
This is all I have.

844
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,103
I'm begging you.

845
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:56,148
Take it or leave it.

846
01:03:04,073 --> 01:03:05,532
Chris?

847
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:06,284
Chris?

848
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:10,246
Baby?

849
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:32,852
Thought you were lactose intolerant.

850
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:34,604
I am.

851
01:03:36,147 --> 01:03:40,234
But then I thought, screw
it, I'm eating ice cream.

852
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:44,113
I paid Rham Jas.

853
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:48,659
What?

854
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:51,787
You're kidding me.

855
01:03:51,788 --> 01:03:52,830
I paid him.

856
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:58,043
Why, I mean, I thought
that you didn't believe.

857
01:03:58,044 --> 01:04:00,837
I don't know what I believe in anymore.

858
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:05,759
I really don't, but I know
that you believe in this.

859
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,511
I know how important it is to you,

860
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:11,224
and I know how much pain
this is causing you.

861
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,227
And, I also remembered,

862
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:19,565
I remembered a promise that I made

863
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:23,193
the night I fell in love with you.

864
01:04:23,194 --> 01:04:27,281
I told myself that I would
always look out for you.

865
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,952
I'd always take care of you.

866
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:33,079
So I paid him.

867
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:39,543
You remember the night that
you fell in love with me?

868
01:04:39,544 --> 01:04:44,256
I remember the second
I fell in love with you.

869
01:04:44,257 --> 01:04:45,299
Oh, my God.

870
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,106
You sure you don't want
me to go in with you?

871
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:02,482
He said I should come alone.

872
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:03,316
Yeah, I know, I know.

873
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,444
He told me the same thing.

874
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:44,274
Christine, if you will
permit me the pleasure

875
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:47,153
of an introduction, Shaun San Dena.

876
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,198
Welcome.

877
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:53,992
How do you do?

878
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:56,411
Shaun San Dena is an experienced medium.

879
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:59,664
Furthermore, she's personally
been touched by the Lamia.

880
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:03,084
I first encountered
this spirit many years ago

881
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:05,378
in this very house.

882
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:07,047
And what happened?

883
01:06:09,342 --> 01:06:12,720
I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.

884
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:21,938
I have waited these long years

885
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:27,109
for a chance at redeeming myself,

886
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:32,072
a chance to destroy the foul thing.

887
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:34,116
And--
- Tetiechko, please.

888
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,958
Tonight, my chance will come.

889
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:47,046
But to summon it, I will need your help.

890
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:50,216
Can you be strong?

891
01:06:53,302 --> 01:06:54,178
I'll try.

892
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,353
My late husband,
Sandor, was also medium.

893
01:07:03,354 --> 01:07:05,397
He chose this site to build a house upon

894
01:07:05,398 --> 01:07:09,193
because he sensed certain
forces at work here.

895
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:13,572
In this place, there is a particular

896
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:25,583
A particular confluence of
forces which allows a doorway

897
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:28,211
to be opened through which we may pass.

898
01:07:32,717 --> 01:07:35,385
And through which others
may pass into our world.

899
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:43,853
Please be seated.

900
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:12,797
What's going on?

901
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:15,175
Everything we're doing
is for your own good.

902
01:08:15,176 --> 01:08:15,968
Please.

903
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:18,429
Christine, please.

904
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:24,977
Thank you.

905
01:08:55,549 --> 01:09:00,011
Once the spirit has entered me,
put my hand upon the animal.

906
01:09:00,012 --> 01:09:01,721
Do you understand?

907
01:09:01,722 --> 01:09:03,223
Yes.

908
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:06,810
I force the spirit of
the Lamia into the goat.

909
01:09:06,811 --> 01:09:09,687
Milos, that's when you strike.

910
01:09:09,688 --> 01:09:10,522
Si, Tetiechko.

911
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,442
I understand.

912
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:26,914
We all must be receptive.

913
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,429
What am I supposed to do?

914
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,640
You must allow the darkness in.

915
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:50,228
You must invite the dead to
co-mingle with your spirit.

916
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,813
I'm scared.

917
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:53,231
Yes.

918
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:57,652
Now repeat these words: I
welcome the dead into my soul.

919
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:03,366
I welcome the dead into my soul.

920
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:05,869
You must believe it!

921
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:08,497
I welcome the dead into my soul.

922
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:13,126
I welcome the dead into my soul.

923
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:23,178
I welcome the dead into my soul.

924
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:31,936
I welcome the dead into my soul!

925
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:42,488
I welcome the dead into my soul!

926
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:43,656
I welcome the dead into my--

927
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,331
Something else is here with us.

928
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:52,374
Yes.

929
01:11:21,195 --> 01:11:23,321
It is not the Lamia.

930
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:27,451
It is the spirit of some
unsettled soul from years ago.

931
01:11:31,497 --> 01:11:35,541
Sometimes the unsettled
ones linger by the door.

932
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:38,254
There are others here, as well.

933
01:11:48,681 --> 01:11:50,765
Begone, foolish spirits!

934
01:11:50,766 --> 01:11:51,975
Begone!

935
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:06,282
She is coming.

936
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:53,639
Who now inhabits the
body of Shaun San Dena?

937
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:57,726
Lamia.

938
01:14:06,068 --> 01:14:08,194
Lamia, what is it you desire?

939
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:11,407
I desire the soul of Christine Brown!

940
01:14:12,825 --> 01:14:16,661
We will feast upon it as
she festers in the grave!

941
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:17,495
No!

942
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:19,247
It was my manager, Jim Jacks!

943
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:21,124
He was the one!
- Silence!

944
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:23,251
Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded

945
01:14:23,252 --> 01:14:25,503
from taking this insignificant woman.

946
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:28,631
Surely she is not worthy
of your greatness.

947
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:38,183
No!

948
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:44,898
I come for you, Christine.

949
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,069
You're mine!

950
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:55,908
No!

951
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:57,869
You tricked me!

952
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:00,455
You black-hearted whore!

953
01:15:00,456 --> 01:15:01,330
Now, Milos, now!

954
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,291
You bitch!

955
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:18,182
Away, unclean spirit!

956
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,823
Lamia!

957
01:15:35,824 --> 01:15:37,783
As one who summoned you to this circle,

958
01:15:37,784 --> 01:15:39,535
I command you to leave this instant!

959
01:15:46,877 --> 01:15:47,836
Christine!

960
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:58,597
I don't want your cat,
you dirty pork queen!

961
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:13,027
Shaun San Dena!

962
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:15,905
- Si.
- You must banish the spirit!

963
01:16:15,906 --> 01:16:17,031
Yes!

964
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:50,232
Milos!

965
01:16:51,108 --> 01:16:52,984
Oh, my God.

966
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:53,818
I'm okay.

967
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:54,986
Thank God!

968
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:55,945
I'm okay.

969
01:16:55,946 --> 01:16:59,532
Unbelievable!

970
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:00,741
You did it!

971
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:02,286
Thank God.

972
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:04,538
I tried.

973
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:06,998
Are you okay?

974
01:17:06,999 --> 01:17:08,124
Oh, my God.

975
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:08,917
Help me!

976
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,507
Call an ambulance.

977
01:17:19,428 --> 01:17:20,971
Is she breathing?

978
01:17:22,598 --> 01:17:23,557
No.

979
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:28,270
Oh, my gosh.

980
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:11,562
It's so sad.

981
01:18:11,563 --> 01:18:13,105
Yes.

982
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:15,441
Strange how things work out.

983
01:18:15,442 --> 01:18:17,693
She waited 40 years for another chance

984
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,488
to overcome the Lamia,

985
01:18:21,156 --> 01:18:25,285
and finally, on the last
night of her life, she did.

986
01:18:26,662 --> 01:18:29,539
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

987
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:33,709
The Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.

988
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,878
This is our lesson tonight.

989
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:36,754
I'm sorry.

990
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:38,047
But I saw her get rid

991
01:18:38,048 --> 01:18:38,881
of the thing.
- No.

992
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:41,509
You saw her drive it from a seance.

993
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:42,802
That is all.

994
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:44,136
It will be back.

995
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,681
The goat was never slaughtered.

996
01:18:46,682 --> 01:18:49,558
When this night is through,

997
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:53,689
the Lamia will come for the
owner of the accursed object.

998
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,694
Unless, of course, you
are no longer the owner.

999
01:18:59,695 --> 01:19:01,571
Do you have the button?

1000
01:19:09,496 --> 01:19:13,583
Make a gift of it and
you've given the curse away.

1001
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,629
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1002
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,256
Because the Lamia will tear the soul

1003
01:19:20,257 --> 01:19:22,383
out of whoever you give that to.

1004
01:19:22,384 --> 01:19:25,178
They'll burn in hell for eternity.

1005
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:30,349
And I would have sent them there.

1006
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,728
I would be your accomplice.

1007
01:19:34,187 --> 01:19:37,733
Whatever you decide,
you have till morning.

1008
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:00,130
Is it over?

1009
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,799
It's over.

1010
01:20:06,887 --> 01:20:08,012
Clay!

1011
01:20:12,684 --> 01:20:14,935
You will burn in hell!

1012
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:17,229
You will burn in hell!

1013
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:20,191
You bitch, you'll burn in hell!

1014
01:20:20,192 --> 01:20:22,485
Your turn's coming!

1015
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:24,028
You will burn in hell!

1016
01:20:24,029 --> 01:20:24,905
You okay?

1017
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:26,782
Holy shit.

1018
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:42,797
Okay, you sure you're still okay

1019
01:20:42,798 --> 01:20:43,756
about the Santa Barbara trip?

1020
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:44,715
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

1021
01:20:44,716 --> 01:20:46,342
And what time should I get you?

1022
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:48,928
It's better if I meet
you at the station.

1023
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:50,846
There's something I've
gotta do on the way.

1024
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:52,598
I can do it, you want
me to do it on my way to--

1025
01:20:52,599 --> 01:20:53,599
No! No.

1026
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,935
I've got it under control.

1027
01:20:55,936 --> 01:20:56,977
Meet at, like, 7:30 at--

1028
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:58,771
Wait! Where's my envelope?

1029
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:00,064
- What envelope?
- It was in my purse.

1030
01:21:00,065 --> 01:21:01,398
I just had it!

1031
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:03,526
It's just an envelope.
- No, it's gotta be here!

1032
01:21:03,527 --> 01:21:06,695
It's here, so we'll find it eventually.

1033
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:08,072
Oh, my God.

1034
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:10,616
- Okay.
- I thought I'd lost it.

1035
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:11,409
Okay.

1036
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:13,244
Bye.
- 7:30.

1037
01:21:13,245 --> 01:21:14,371
Don't be late.

1038
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:35,516
Dad, can we go to the Angel game?

1039
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:37,059
What about the Dodgers?

1040
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,228
We're only gonna be
in town for a few days.

1041
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:41,897
But if there's a home game...

1042
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:45,317
I'm sure if I just tell him
how much I care about you,

1043
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,569
I mean, he's gotta understand.

1044
01:21:51,491 --> 01:21:53,909
Are you sure
you don't want anything else?

1045
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:54,743
No.

1046
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:55,578
So you're just gonna sit

1047
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:58,038
here drinking coffee all night long?

1048
01:21:58,039 --> 01:21:58,832
Yes.

1049
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,333
Maybe! What's it to you?

1050
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:03,586
Honey, I make my money on tips.

1051
01:22:03,587 --> 01:22:05,629
Coffee drinkers don't tip.

1052
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,172
Honey, just keep the coffee coming

1053
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:10,468
or I'll give you a tip you won't forget.

1054
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:52,801
Oh, my gosh.

1055
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:55,846
What a delightful surprise.

1056
01:22:55,847 --> 01:22:58,807
Well, you're the sweetest
person in the world.

1057
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:03,270
Never mind what it's about, Stu.

1058
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:04,271
Just get here in 10 minutes

1059
01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:05,564
or I'm gonna tell Mr. Jacks something

1060
01:23:05,565 --> 01:23:07,650
you don't want me to tell him.

1061
01:23:07,651 --> 01:23:09,234
Oh, yeah?

1062
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:10,235
Like what?

1063
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:13,280
Well, for starters, that you
stole the McPherson loan file

1064
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:16,450
off my desk and gave it to First National.

1065
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:17,826
Now you got nine minutes!

1066
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:23,666
Give me another.

1067
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:24,626
Seriously?

1068
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:35,761
Oh, God, Christine,
please don't tell on me.

1069
01:23:35,762 --> 01:23:37,805
I mean, if my dad ever finds out,

1070
01:23:37,806 --> 01:23:39,098
just tell me what you want.

1071
01:23:39,099 --> 01:23:41,183
I need to give something to you.

1072
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,518
A little gift.

1073
01:23:42,519 --> 01:23:43,311
A gift?

1074
01:23:44,813 --> 01:23:46,146
But I don't understand.

1075
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:47,106
I thought you called me down here

1076
01:23:47,107 --> 01:23:49,108
because I gave that
loan to First National.

1077
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:50,442
Look, you don't need to understand!

1078
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:51,444
Just shut up!

1079
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:55,572
Now, this gift that I'm giving you,

1080
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:56,740
it'll become your property.

1081
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:59,285
You'll be the owner, all right?

1082
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:02,956
Okay.

1083
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:09,462
Okay.

1084
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:13,925
What?

1085
01:24:15,844 --> 01:24:16,803
Forget it.

1086
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:19,471
But I thought you wanted to give it to me

1087
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:20,389
'cause of the loan stuff.

1088
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,433
Just leave.

1089
01:24:24,936 --> 01:24:26,270
Okay.

1090
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:28,648
Thank you so much, Christine.

1091
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:35,863
But you're not gonna tell my dad, right?

1092
01:24:35,864 --> 01:24:36,656
Go!
- Okay.

1093
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:50,211
Who does deserve this?

1094
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:12,149
Well?

1095
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,359
Is it possible?

1096
01:25:14,569 --> 01:25:17,738
There are gypsy blessings
bestowed upon the dead.

1097
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:19,740
They give gifts to their departed

1098
01:25:19,741 --> 01:25:22,242
to curry favor with the deceased's soul,

1099
01:25:22,243 --> 01:25:24,871
for, truly, the soul never dies.

1100
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:27,790
Yes.

1101
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:29,374
I do believe you can give the curse

1102
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:31,460
to someone who has passed on,

1103
01:25:31,461 --> 01:25:32,920
but you must make a formal gift

1104
01:25:32,921 --> 01:25:34,963
of the accursed object to the deceased.

1105
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:36,757
Oh, I'll do better than that.

1106
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:39,384
I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!

1107
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:40,761
I'm gonna get some.

1108
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:29,704
I'm giving it back to you!

1109
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:33,833
You're gonna take this thing!

1110
01:27:35,293 --> 01:27:37,754
Are you gonna take this thing?

1111
01:27:40,173 --> 01:27:40,965
Take it!

1112
01:27:54,812 --> 01:27:58,023
That's the last of my hair you're getting!

1113
01:28:03,112 --> 01:28:04,656
I, Christine Brown,

1114
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:08,116
do hereby make a formal gift

1115
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:11,162
of this button to you, Sylvia Ganush!

1116
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:14,958
Choke on it, bitch!

1117
01:28:30,348 --> 01:28:31,140
Goodbye.

1118
01:30:01,105 --> 01:30:02,064
Hi, it's Christine.

1119
01:30:02,065 --> 01:30:04,816
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

1120
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:07,319
Christine, it's Jim, Jim Jacks.

1121
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,321
I'm sorry I'm calling so
early, but last night,

1122
01:30:09,322 --> 01:30:11,156
I found some troubling information

1123
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:13,575
about our friend Stu Rubin.

1124
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:17,079
Apparently, he stole your
file on the McPherson loan

1125
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:20,624
and then tried to broker his
own deal at First National.

1126
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,501
I guess he thought we wouldn't find out.

1127
01:30:22,502 --> 01:30:25,295
And we wouldn't have, either,
except that an hour ago,

1128
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:30,175
he came by my house and tried
to pin the whole thing on you.

1129
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:31,385
After I confronted him

1130
01:30:31,386 --> 01:30:33,762
about a few inconsistencies in his story,

1131
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:36,139
he broke down crying and, well,

1132
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:39,226
we won't be seeing him around anymore.

1133
01:30:39,227 --> 01:30:42,604
So I just wanted you to know
that, come Monday morning,

1134
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:46,734
that assistant manager's
position will be waiting for you.

1135
01:30:58,329 --> 01:31:00,330
Passenger
Benson, please meet your party

1136
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:02,959
at the concourse ticket counter.

1137
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:07,045
Welcome to Union Station.

1138
01:31:07,046 --> 01:31:08,630
- Cookie, Miss?
- No, thanks.

1139
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:11,383
Train travel as
your mode of transportation,

1140
01:31:11,384 --> 01:31:12,968
and we wish you a pleasant journey.

1141
01:31:27,358 --> 01:31:29,317
Hi. Good morning.

1142
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:32,904
- I'm sorry, we're not open.
- Oh, I just want this coat.

1143
01:31:32,905 --> 01:31:33,780
We're not open yet.

1144
01:31:33,781 --> 01:31:35,031
My boyfriend and I are taking

1145
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:38,161
this really special trip this morning.

1146
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:40,121
Please?

1147
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:46,209
Northbound
Surfliner, service to Van Nuys,

1148
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:49,588
Simi Valley, Oxnard, Santa Barbara, San--

1149
01:31:49,589 --> 01:31:51,214
Clay.

1150
01:31:51,215 --> 01:31:52,132
- Hey.
- Hey!

1151
01:31:52,133 --> 01:31:52,925
Oh, man!

1152
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:55,760
God, I'm so glad you're
here, so many things

1153
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:56,636
I wanna tell you.
- Wait, there's something

1154
01:31:56,637 --> 01:31:58,597
I wanna say while I have
it straight in my head.

1155
01:31:58,598 --> 01:32:00,474
Okay. Go ahead.

1156
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:03,852
You never stopped believing in me.

1157
01:32:03,853 --> 01:32:05,396
Thank you for that.

1158
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:07,606
And there's something else,

1159
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:11,068
something that I couldn't admit to before.

1160
01:32:12,111 --> 01:32:14,446
I could have given Mrs. Ganush

1161
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:18,075
another extension on
her loan, but I didn't.

1162
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:22,788
It was my decision,
and it was wrong of me.

1163
01:32:32,632 --> 01:32:35,009
You have such a good heart.

1164
01:32:37,303 --> 01:32:39,764
You're so beautiful right now.

1165
01:32:41,349 --> 01:32:42,641
Do you like my new coat?

1166
01:32:42,642 --> 01:32:43,808
I do. I really do.

1167
01:32:43,809 --> 01:32:44,809
What happened to the old one, though?

1168
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:45,644
I threw it out.

1169
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:47,145
And I never want to see it again.

1170
01:32:47,146 --> 01:32:48,480
Oh, no.

1171
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:50,649
Oh, that's too bad, 'cause
I, look what I found.

1172
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:52,610
I found this in the car.

1173
01:32:54,654 --> 01:32:57,906
And I thought maybe you could...

1174
01:32:57,907 --> 01:33:00,283
I thought maybe you could sew it back on.

1175
01:33:00,284 --> 01:33:03,620
Yeah, I think you might have
my Standing Liberty quarter,

1176
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:06,414
'cause the envelopes
kind of look the same.

1177
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:08,833
Chris, what's wrong?

1178
01:33:09,877 --> 01:33:13,046
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1179
01:33:13,047 --> 01:33:14,589
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1180
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:15,465
Stop! Chris!

1181
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,301
Oh, God!

1182
01:33:18,302 --> 01:33:19,427
Hey! Hey!

1183
01:33:19,428 --> 01:33:20,387
Hey, hey, no!

1184
01:33:20,388 --> 01:33:21,263
Hey!

1185
01:33:21,264 --> 01:33:22,223
Oh, God, no!

1186
01:33:27,645 --> 01:33:28,770
Hey! No!

1187
01:33:35,027 --> 01:33:36,403
Help me!

1188
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:41,742
Help me!

1189
01:33:43,035 --> 01:33:43,828
Help me!

1190
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:46,414
Help me, please!
