00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,162
Yeah.

185
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,084
I miss Pubba too.

186
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,381
What's your favorite memory of him?

187
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,010
It was on my birthday, when he got me Dog.

188
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,098
Yeah. It's when he got me Dog.

189
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,308
Is that your stuffed animal?

190
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,729
Then when I fell into the purple flowers,
Dog was there too.

191
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:33,693
And I followed him through the forest,
and he brought me to see Pubba.

192
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,238
And Pubba told me that I have to grow up
and trust what's in here.

193
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,242
Can I see him?

194
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:43,952
Dog, I mean?

195
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,629
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- What's wrong?

196
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,674
[Gus] Dog's not in here.
He's lost. I can't find him.

197
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,553
- [Jepperd] What's going on?
- I lost Dog. He's not here.

198
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,864
[Bear] It's okay.
You must've dropped him here somewhere.

199
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,932
We'll check the other cars and find him.

200
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,559
[clattering]

201
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,298
[Bear] You heard that too, right?

202
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,523
[chains rattling]

203
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,650
[lock screeching]

204
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,985
Someone's coming.

205
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,529
Hide. Hide, now!

206
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,864
Come on. Hide.

207
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,366
[ominous music playing]

208
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,681
[tool clanking]

209
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,934
[mouthing] Stop.

210
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,440
[glass clinking]

211
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,025
[music swells]

212
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,109
[man] Who's there?

213
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,948
You're in trouble now.

214
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,368
This ain't no passenger train.

215
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,870
[bottle scraping]

216
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,557
[music builds]

217
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,809
Gotcha!

218
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,727
[Gus screaming]

219
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,811
[Gus] Let me go!

220
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,355
[Gus moans]

221
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,272
Wait a second!

222
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,482
[Jepperd] Leave him alone!

223
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,900
- [Jepperd grunts]
- [man] Ah!

224
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,110
[man grunts]

225
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,445
[man groans]

226
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,948
[man] Ah!

227
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,784
- [weapon clanging]
- [both grunting]

228
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,327
[boxes clattering]

229
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,537
[Bear] Holy shit.

230
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,833
- [Bear inhales]
- [both grunting]

231
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,336
[both grunting]

232
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,796
[man] Ah!

233
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,798
[both straining]

234
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,802
[grunting continues]

235
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,055
[boxes clattering]

236
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,933
- [man] Ah!
- Jimmy!

237
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,602
Jimmy Jacobs?

238
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:17,940
TJ?

239
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:22,194
[Jepperd laughs]

240
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,655
- Oh my God!
- Tommy Jepperd. It is you!

241
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,614
[Jepperd sighs]

242
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,991
It's good to see you, bubba!

243
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,327
Glad I recognized you when I did,
or I might've messed up your pretty face.

244
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,411
Ha! You wish!

245
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,038
What are you doing here?

246
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,582
You know, I thought I'd take a trip.

247
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,458
- [both chuckle]
- Man!

248
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,086
Great. Now there are two of you.

249
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,382
[chuckles] Bear, it's okay. I want to
introduce you to Jimmy "Fat Man" Jacobs.

250
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,717
[Jimmy] Fat Man.

251
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,344
- I forgot about that.
- Jimmy and I played ball together.

252
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:52,182
You're looking at the greatest defensive
end in the history of the Guardians!

253
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,143
[both] Ah-ooh!

254
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,227
[Jepperd laughs]

255
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,314
Only 'cause you took those hits for me.
Made me look good.

256
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,608
My head was harder,
but you took your fair share.

257
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:05,529
Ain't that the truth. I got this funny
sorta static in my head these days too.

258
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,698
Hard to focus sometimes.

259
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,242
I think those are called concussions.

260
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,038
Wait, so you must have
run across those other guys too, huh?

261
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,248
Troy? Rocco?

262
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,542
What about D-Train?

263
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,295
Oh, they're not around anymore, man.

264
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,254
[chuckles]

265
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,381
I wonder how those guys are doing.

266
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,967
We had some good times, didn't we?

267
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,219
[Jepperd exhales]

268
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,182
Yeah, well.

269
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,225
You're working on the train now, huh?

270
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:39,939
Oh, yeah. Been running charters and
hauling supplies to whoever hires us.

271
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,650
Company's got me on maintenance
and crap like that.

272
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,111
Ain't so bad,
but I sure do miss being on the field.

273
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,779
Don't you?

274
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,908
[inhales, exhales]

275
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,326
Where's Gus?

276
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,662
Hey, Gus.

277
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,750
- It's all right. You can come out.
- The one with the antlers?

278
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,668
Sweet Tooth.

279
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,751
Jepp.

280
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,630
- Hey, Gus. I'm not playing.
- Jepperd.

281
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,257
[ominous music playing]

282
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,258
Where is he?

283
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,012
I think he went looking for Dog.

284
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,182
[music builds to a climax]

285
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,603
[sinister music playing]

286
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,691
[Bobby warbles]

287
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,858
What is it?

288
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,610
What does it mean?

289
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,862
This area's been marked.

290
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,781
By the Last Men?

291
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,118
We need to go.

292
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,328
Right now.

293
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,384
Bobby, go check the tunnels.

294
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,803
But whatever you do, stay out of sight.

295
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,138
- Check.
- Okay?

296
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,643
Shouldn't we take the ribbons down?
That would keep the bad men away, right?

297
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,228
[bolt clicks]

298
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,230
They'd know we're here for sure if we did.

299
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,649
Maybe we should hide, then.

300
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,944
I can get the others and I can play
hide-and-seek, like you showed me.

301
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,822
If they already know we're here,
hiding won't do any good.

302
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,074
We wouldn't have time to run.

303
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,161
- [chains rattling]
- [lock clicks]

304
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,747
[Pigtail] Then what do we do?

305
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,001
Mom!

306
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,590
Hey. Everything's gonna be all right,
I promise.

307
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,216
But I wanna help.

308
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,097
Wendy, I promise.

309
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,308
Do you trust me?

310
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,900
- [sniffs]
- [ominous music playing]

311
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,154
Someone's outside.

312
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,453
[metal rattling]

313
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,662
The outer fence.

314
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,885
Who is he?

315
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,553
A Last Man.

316
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,099
[Pigtail] Why is he just standing there?

317
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,352
- He knows we're here, doesn't he?
- [shushing]

318
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,312
Let me think.

319
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,069
Move on, please, move on.

320
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,617
I thought we would have more time.

321
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,703
Are we safe?

322
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,458
[somber music playing]

323
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,842
[indistinct radio chatter]

324
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,719
[glass clinking]

325
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,223
[Johnny] Oh, I can't remember
the last time I saw these.

326
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,641
Mind if I have one?

327
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,062
Rani, you shouldn't be exerting yourself.

328
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,480
Oh, hush, I'm all right.

329
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,649
[exhales]

330
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,736
It'd be easier to pack
if we knew where we were going.

331
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,946
Sorry.

332
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:20,200
Are we going east? That's where
your little Last Men clubhouse is, right?

333
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,284
Rani.

334
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,412
General Abbot says it's classified.

335
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,875
[distant chatter]

336
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,334
So that's Abbot, then.

337
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:30,919
[Dr. Singh] Rani.

338
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,881
I thought he'd be less beardy.

339
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,216
Rani, can you just stop, please?!

340
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,929
[exhales]

341
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,766
- Hey. What is it? What's going on?
- Hey.

342
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,311
- I can't find all the letters.
- Take a breath and relax.

343
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,794
[Dr. Singh] Don't tell me to relax!

344
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,107
We almost just burnt to death,
then Abbot showed up, then you...

345
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,233
[whispers] Okay.

346
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,903
[stammering] And now I can't...
I can't find the tiles,

347
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,071
and that means we can't play anymore.

348
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,741
- I know.
- And w-what we gonna do about Trixie?

349
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,452
They're never gonna let us bring her.

350
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,535
Who's Trixie?

351
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,956
That your kid?

352
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,795
Our horse.
She really helped us out a few times.

353
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Hey.

354
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,258
Can you, uh...

355
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,178
Can you please just wait outside?

356
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,597
Hmm.

357
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
I can't.

358
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,353
Where exactly do you think we're gonna go?

359
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,825
Wait. Wait!

360
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,916
I know you're freaking out,
but just try to breathe. It'll be okay.

361
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,335
No, Rani, it's not going to be okay.

362
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,588
How on earth am I supposed
to find a cure for the Sick?

363
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,882
Everyone's been looking for one
for the last ten years.

364
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,425
I don't know, but what I do know is

365
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,262
we have more time together
than we did this morning.

366
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,224
[exhales]

367
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,561
[whispers] What do you think he's gonna do
when he finds out that we were bluffing?

368
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,440
[stammering]

369
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,564
If I didn't know the truth,
I would've believed you.

370
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,529
Your explanation was <i>very</i> convincing.

371
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm gonna go pack my things.

372
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,163
Adi.

373
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,501
Adi, come on.

374
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,586
[ominous music playing]

375
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,720
[inhales sharply]

376
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,687
[melancholic music playing]

377
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,998
- [Dr. Singh exhales]
- [Rani sniffs]

378
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,505
I remember when the first patient came in.

379
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,430
Her name was Freya.

380
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,308
Oh, Adi.

381
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,019
It didn't seem like
anything to worry about at first,

382
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:38,565
just a strange case of the flu,
something that would pass, and then...

383
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,819
a week later she came back, and this time...

384
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,989
she was worse, much worse.

385
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,366
No matter what I did...

386
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,328
no matter how hard I tried to help her...

387
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,539
it didn't matter.

388
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,250
[scoffs]

389
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,835
Then she died.

390
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,465
[Rani sighs]

391
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,384
[Dr. Singh] I know.

392
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,890
I still see them, you know.
All of them. Their faces.

393
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,768
[ominous music playing]

394
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,897
We said we were gonna take care of them,

395
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,191
so they wouldn't be afraid, you know?

396
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,442
[sniffs]

397
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,823
[Dr. Singh]
But all the while, we knew they would die.

398
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,327
And that more would come
and take their place.

399
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,372
After a while, I stopped caring.

400
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,001
Well, I had to,
just to keep going with it.

401
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,089
It made me feel numb.

402
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,594
Hmm.

403
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,683
That's why I stopped being a doctor.

404
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,060
[inhales, exhales]

405
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,856
And after taking over
the clinic from Bell...

406
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,068
and what we did to Doug and Nancie...

407
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,866
that feeling's back, and for what?

408
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,745
To find a cure.

409
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,831
[chuckles]

410
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,416
You don't honestly believe...

411
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,709
I believe

412
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,628
in you, Adi.

413
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,380
[sniffs]

414
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,007
And so did Dr. Bell.

415
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,344
That's why she gave her journal to you.

416
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,974
You can finish what she started.

417
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,104
You're not alone in this.

418
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,360
We've made it this far together,
haven't we?

419
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,487
[chuckles]

420
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,031
Together.

421
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,574
Hmm?

422
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,581
[indistinct radio chatter]

423
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,170
[train whistle blowing]

424
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,131
Gus, you in here?

425
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,882
[Bear] Gus?

426
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,678
I used to sneak off
and I'd get my ass whooped.

427
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,472
He's a kid. He misses his toy.

428
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:20,018
[Jimmy] Don't worry, T. I know every nook
and cranny of this train. We'll find him.

429
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,521
You guys are hauling a lot of candy bars.

430
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,731
Yeah, part of the same transpo job.

431
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,150
Thought about snaggin'
a couple for myself.

432
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,238
Well, if he isn't in here,
I can't imagine where he is.

433
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,659
Gus?

434
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,412
Sweet Tooth, come on.

435
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,956
Stop playing games.

436
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,208
You'll never guess what they have on here.

437
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,043
A car full of Choc-O-Rockets!

438
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,296
Your boy's quite the troublemaker, huh?

439
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,756
Chip off the old block?

440
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,842
I think Louisa was still pregnant
the last time I saw you.

441
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,806
- Crazy you had one of them animal kids...
- Gus is not my kid.

442
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,853
We should spread out.

443
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,314
I'll check the next car.

444
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,152
- [door closes]
- Dumbass.

445
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,154
What happened, bubba?

446
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,824
To Louisa and the baby?

447
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,367
[somber music playing]

448
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,827
They're gone, Jimmy.

449
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,080
Just like D-Train and the others.

450
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,626
I'm sorry, T.

451
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,753
The Sick get 'em?

452
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,508
What's with the deer kid, then?

453
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,261
He's just a kid, um...

454
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,060
He's just a kid I'm trying to help.

455
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,357
Doesn't sound like the Jepp I remember.

456
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,985
It used to be all about you.

457
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,240
- Mm-hmm.
- [door opens]

458
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,786
Gus! Christ, kid.
Where the hell have you been?

459
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,122
Almost gave me a heart attack.

460
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,250
I can't find him, Jepp.
I... I still can't find Dog.

461
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,337
Hey. Buck up, kid.

462
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,006
There's no crying in the apocalypse.

463
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,634
I'll get you another Dog, I promise.

464
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,968
[Gus] You don't understand.

465
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,679
Pubba made Dog out of his own socks.

466
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,682
It even still smells like him.

467
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,313
[hopeful music playing]

468
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,648
Hey.

469
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,484
Hey. Remember I told you
about reaching Colorado?

470
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,488
When we cross the big river,
we'll be in Colorado.

471
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,782
Well...

472
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,577
Tell me what you see.

473
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,336
Does... Does that mean...

474
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,507
Yeah, Sweet Tooth.

475
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,384
We made it.

476
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,761
We're in Colorado.

477
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,973
[sighs]

478
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,018
We made it to Colorado.

479
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,697
All we have to figure out now
is where the hell GoGro is.

480
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,281
[Jimmy] GoGro?

481
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,952
Did you say GoGro?

482
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,787
Yeah, you know it?

483
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,415
Of course I know it.

484
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,585
Well, where the hell is it?

485
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,837
It...

486
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,172
It's actually...

487
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,299
It's, uh...

488
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,469
Focus, Jimmy.

489
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,513
No. I know I know it, it's...

490
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,724
I hear it all the time.

491
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,853
I'll check my cargo manifest. Yeah, yeah.

492
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,813
[Jimmy exhales]

493
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,735
- [Jepperd] G, as in GoGro.
- [Jimmy] GoGro.

494
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,696
[exhales, chuckles]

495
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,864
[giggles]

496
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,449
I remember.

497
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,867
It's short for Goss Grove,

498
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,661
but nobody calls it that,
everyone calls it GoGro.

499
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,705
It's a neighborhood outside of Essex City.

500
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,249
- [Jepperd] That's the next stop.
- Thanks, other Big Man!

501
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,417
[Jimmy] No worries, kid.

502
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,753
- What's wrong?
- Last Men. On the train.

503
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,297
What? What are Last Men
doing on this train?

504
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,424
It's their charter, T.
I thought I told you that.

505
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,187
You definitely did not
tell us that, Jimmy.

506
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,387
They're moving operations south,
including the Choc-O-Rockets.

507
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,346
General Abbot...

508
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,598
Not important.

509
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,393
- Where are they?
- In the next car, headed this way.

510
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,352
Shit.

511
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,980
Come on, let's take 'em. I'm done hiding.

512
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,691
No. We don't know
how many of them there are.

513
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,027
So what do we do?

514
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,029
[exhales] Um...

515
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,616
Follow me. Yeah.

516
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,869
[suspenseful music builds]

517
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,646
[Bear]
Uh, guys? There's nowhere else to go.

518
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,399
I'll talk to 'em,
you guys stay out of sight.

519
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,860
I'll tell them nobody's here,
they'll believe me.

520
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,030
Jimmy, no offense, but you've never
been able to sweet-talk anybody.

521
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,283
They're coming.

522
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,455
We jump. It's our only option.

523
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,793
[indistinct chatter]

524
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,926
You gotta be shittin' me.

525
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,096
[Gus] Jepp?

526
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,890
What are we gonna do?

527
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,193
We're gonna do something stupid.

528
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,916
Hold it.

529
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,461
[exhales]

530
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,256
What's up, fellas?

531
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,259
What are you doing here?

532
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,430
Uh, you didn't hear? They...
We got a leak out back in the galley.

533
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,348
It smells like gas.

534
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,560
The caboose is off limits
until we can sort it out.

535
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,896
Can't be too careful.

536
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,772
The stove is electric.

537
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,651
