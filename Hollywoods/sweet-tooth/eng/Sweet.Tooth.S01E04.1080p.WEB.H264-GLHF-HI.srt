Did you know that before the virus came,
the water wasn't blue?

184
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,540
That's because
they filled the water with trash.

186
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,629
But once kids like <i>you</i> were born,

You can keep the Earth alive.

190
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,181
And that's why we vowed

191
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,059

no matter what the cost.

But now,

00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,214
I have one last
very important question for you, Gus.

201
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,177

I'm not sure how much longer
we can hold him.

205

You've seen how big he is, right?

206
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,362
We've dealt with worse.

207
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,324
I don't get
why we can't just kill him now.

We've never had a hybrid

No!

Yeah. Is that okay?

Jepp's taking me to Colorado
because that's where she is.

Do you know her? Her name is Birdie.

Birdie?

00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,446
What a fitting name for your mom.

226

Sorry, I don't know her.

227
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,830
But we can maybe find out more.

00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,206
We can?

Would you like to stay?

Well, maybe I can come back and visit

Can I ask you something?

235

If Jepp was supposed
to take you to Colorado,

why aren't you there right now?

237

Before you guys came.

239
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,753

have to go on the train alone?

Sometimes, I'd get so excited
just to see another person,

No, but he doesn't need to.

00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,194
- That won't be necessary.
- You seem awfully sure.

359
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,949
Think we have enough test kits for that?
No, uh, we test when we see symptoms.

360
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,326
We all voted.

361
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,746
There have been
three cases in the past six months.

362
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,832
It's a new wave.

363

We barely survived the last one.

364
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,668
The answer's no.

365
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,130
Well, I'm calling a meeting.

366
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,632
- Maybe it's time we voted again.
- Nancie, please.

367
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,717
I'm sorry.

368
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,927
Let's agree to disagree.

369
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,139
I guess the, uh, community will decide.

370
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,222
[Nancie] Yes.

371
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,851

It was yesterday, right?

Uh.. [titters]

382
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,215
Right. Um, sorry.

Do I need to take

392

What did I say?

393
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,876
- It's only for listening.
- It's only for listening.

394
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,254
Never talking.

395
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,547
I know.

396
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,674
[Aimee] I know how curious you are.

397
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,135

This man is a monster

What about
all the other hybrids he's hurt?

549
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,749
Stand down, Tiger.
