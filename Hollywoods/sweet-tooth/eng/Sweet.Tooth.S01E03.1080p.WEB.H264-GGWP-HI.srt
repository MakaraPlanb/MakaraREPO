Peachy.

Are you pre-gaming without me?

Pre-gaming for what?

204
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,671
Oh, hell, Doug Duncan's party.
We'll have to skip it. We'll have to.

205
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,883
We can't skip Survivors' Day.
They'll never give us a moment's peace.

206
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,302
It's not worth it. You're not 100%.

I'm not contagious. Bell's serum
still hasn't entirely worn off.

You have all the symptoms.
We'll be exposed.

I'm trying everything in Bell's notebook,

I can't go there.

We'll be fine.

We can tell them I didn't feel like it,
I just don't like parties.

221
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,283
Hanson said he just didn't like parties,

222
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,161
and you remember what they did to him.

223
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,627
- No one liked Hanson.
- [scoffs] We'll be okay.

We should have an exit strategy.

- All right, um, "gargoyle."
- What?

227
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,010
If either of us says "gargoyle,"
we say our goodbyes.

How you gonna work "gargoyle"

That's why it's a good code word.

Thanks.
Rani, you are a sight for sore eyes.

You look fantabulous.

And Adi, well,
the pinnacle of class, as always.

You're too kind. You're too kind.

249
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,411
[Doug] And a book? All three?

250
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,163
Everything but an epic poem.

251
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,040
This should be easy for someone, eh?

252
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,834
Nancie, you're flailing like a stuck fish.
Just focus, okay?

253
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,670
- Maybe try giving us a "sounds like."
- [Doug] Okay.

254
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,463
[all] Sounds like...

- Sounds like "Twyla"?

- "There"?
- "Fur"?

260
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,682
- Sounds like "fur," okay.
- "Burr"?

"Deter," um...

262
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,810
- "Blur."
- "Slur."

Do you know what furries are?

00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,105
- Uh...
- It's "fur"!

265
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,149
No, it sounds like "fur,"
it can't <i>be</i> "fur."

266
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,443
"Her"! is the word "her"?

That is, until Kelly walked in my practice
looking for a pair of glasses,

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,420
but finding me instead.

00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,925
Suddenly all those sappy love songs

Well, it's true.

Sh, shh. I hear you.
Let's just get this over with,

337

and then maybe everyone will calm down.

338
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,255
Yeah?

What?

[Doug] No.
