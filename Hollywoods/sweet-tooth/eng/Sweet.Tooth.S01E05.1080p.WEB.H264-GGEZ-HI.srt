Okay.

180
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,173
Except sometimes
people also did it to kill other people.

181
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,801
They called it "war."

182
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,471
[Gus] You guys must think I'm stupid,
'cause if this blanket was so magical,

183
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,141
then why would this person
just leave it hanging in a tree forever?

Not cool.

[Bear] Relax, we're almost there.

[Jepperd] Where are you going, anyway?

190
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:43,994
[Bear] Somewhere.

191

[Jepperd] Define "somewhere."

192
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,156
[Bear] There are people down south
who take in hybrids.

193
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,877
Just 'cause I'm not in the Army anymore
doesn't mean I'll stop helping hybrids.

194
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,088
- What about you?
- [Jepperd] What about me?

Shh!

00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,759
Hey, Gus.

Is that a caramel apple tree I see?

He's got super hearing.

200

All right, he can't hear us. Listen.

201
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,856
It doesn't matter what I believe.

202
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,859
That little dude's got hope
coming out of every pore.

203
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,236
No clue where he gets it from.

204
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,614
Why are you doing this anyways?

205
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,366
Helping Gus.

206
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,493
[Jepperd] I got my reasons.

207
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,996
Well, why don't you define those reasons?

208
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,624
I don't have to define anything to you.

[Gus] It looks pretty happy to me.

the dead here after the Great Crumble.

[Bear]
No one goes close enough to find out.

218
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,165
So how are we gonna get across?

That.

220
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,169
[Jepperd] No way.

221
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,797
No way in hell.

222
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,882
What? You scared?

223
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,803
No, I'm smart. There's no way
that thing's holding our weight.

I think you mean <i>your</i> weight.

- I'm just trying to get to the train.

- [Gus] Guys?
- Back off.

No, no, no, see, you act tough,

229
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,877
like it didn't affect you when
your friends threw you out with the trash.

230

You know, if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here in the first place.

I know it's hard for you to understand,

234
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,703
because you don't care
about anyone but yourself,

I had, and you just blew it all up!

Wait, Gus.

244
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,975
That's too far.
Just wait for us, okay?

- Not if you keep fighting.
- [yells] Gus, get your ass back here!

Do not yell at him.

It helps me. [yells] Gus!

It wasn't until I came here,

354
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,984
and found you, that I finally...

355
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,778
[inhales]

356
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,988
...learned how to just be myself.

357
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,407
How do I learn to do that?

358
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,577
By not thinking
there's anything wrong with you.

359
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,622
Because you are perfect the way you are.

360
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,959
[both giggle]

361
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,670
[Bobby strains]

362
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,004
Bobby, you came back!

363
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,049
Mm-hmm.

364
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,592
What do you have there, Bobby?

365
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,512
[ominous music playing]

366
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,721
Where did you find this?

367
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,266
Mm... fence.

368
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,976
He found it on the fence.

369
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,064
They've found us.

370
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,608
[ominous music builds]

371
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,530

[panting]

373
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,950
Dog?

374
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,204
[Dog panting, barking]

375
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,288
[Gus] Dog?

376
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,791
Wait for me!

377
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,933
[creatures vocalizing]

378
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,481
[Dog barks]

379
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,691
Where are we going?

380
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,236
Dog, slow down!

381
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,201
Dog! Where are you?

382
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,161
[Dog barks]

383
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,625
[Dog barks]

384
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,681
[breathing heavily] Mm.

385
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,557
[sniffs]

386
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,019
Hmm?

387
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:34,524
[fantastical music playing]

388
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,167

[hopeful music playing]

391
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,056
Pubba!

392
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,891
[Pubba] Ah.

393
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,353
[sighs contently]

394
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,980
Gus!

395
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,773
You've gotten so tall!

396
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,150
Oh, hang on.

397
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,821
[Gus straining]

398
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,739
There we go, that's better.

399
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,162
You look tired.

400
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,747
[Pubba] Oh, I came a long way.

401
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,542
I've missed you.

402
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,128
I've missed you too.

403
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,340
I have to tell you something.

404
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,220
And you're going to get mad.

405
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,433
Okay, well, try me,
but we don't have a lot of time.

406
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,688
I broke your rule.

407
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,817
The one rule you told me
never, ever, ever to break.

408
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,445
I crossed the fence.

409
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,405
Yeah.

410
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,074
Are you mad?

411
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,409
Uh...

412
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,538
I knew you'd cross the fence
sooner or later.

413
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,248
You did?

414
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,877
I just wanted you
to stay the way I remembered you.

415
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,130
So I did the right thing?

416
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,301
We don't always know what's right,
that's part of growing up.

417
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,054
You just have to follow what's in here.

418
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,805
Even when it's hard.

419
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,766
I haven't told you the worst part yet.

420
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,849
Tell me.

421
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,146
I left with one of those people
you warned me about.

422
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,232
Okay.

423
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,485
But he's not really that bad.

424
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,278
There's some good in him, I think.

425
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,530
You just gotta look for it.

426
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,617
So, um, you're learning.

427
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,453
Human beings are complicated.

428
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:55,207
- He and Bear are taking me to find Mom.
- There's a Bear too?

429
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,583
Good. Good.

430
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,836
They're my friends.
They're just not good at getting along.

431
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,588
Listen to me.

432
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:06,343
Now that you've left the fence,
you have to keep going. All right?

433
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,346
You have a train to catch.

434
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,265
But I want to stay here with you!

435
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,268
I know you do, bud, I know.
But look, look.

436
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,397
You have more important things to do now.

437
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,441
It's not just about you
and me anymore, all right?

438
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,362
There are other kids like you out there.
They're counting on you.

439
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,658
But you have to be brave, all right?
Even when it's hard.

440
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,827
Okay?

441
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,245
Don't be afraid.

442
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,247
Okay. Now come on.

443
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,294
Let me show you.

444
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,841
You're ready now, Gus.

445
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,553
Just remember what I told you.

446
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,263
Look at me, Pubba.

447
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,807
I see you.

448
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,643
And soon, the world will see you too.

449
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,857
- [Pubba's breath echoes]
- [creatures scuttling]

[ominous music playing]

451
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,608
Pubba?

00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,530
[panting]

453
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,656
Pubba!

454
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,327
[yells] Come back, don't leave me!

455
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,122
[howls] Don't leave me, come back!

456

00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,506
[inhales sharply]

459
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,344
So nice to meet you, Gus.

460
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,263
[creature snarling]

461
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,390
[Pubba] <i>He's coming, don't stop!</i>

462
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,436
<i>Don't be afraid, Gus. You're ready now.</i>

463
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,650
[Jepperd] <i>Gus!</i>

464
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,569
[yells] I'm not afraid!

465
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,738
- [Jepperd]Gus!
- [Bear] Gus!

466
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,008
- [Pubba]<i> You're ready now, Gus.
- </i>[Jepperd] <i>Sweet Tooth!</i>

467
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,992
[Pubba] <i>Remember what I told you.</i>

468
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,871
<i>It's up to you, Gus. Don't give up now.</i>

469
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,790
[suspenseful music playing]

470
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,297
[music builds to a climax]

471
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,423
[all grunt]

472
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,842
[Jepperd breathing heavily]

473
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,094
- [Jepperd grunts]
- [Bear] Get me out of this thing.

474
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,473
I'm not afraid.

475
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,308
Could you have gone any slower?

476
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,144
- I didn't see you carrying him.
- [Bear] I can barely see anything.

477
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,439
- [Jepperd] You wanted to wear the helmet.
- You wanted to wear the parachute.

478
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,066
- Guys!
- [Jepperd] It fit me!

479
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,276
Make a fist.

480
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,236
[Jepperd] Uh...

481
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,821
Make a fist.

482
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,783
Now bump 'em.

483
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,167
Now, let's go.

484
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,046
[melancholic music playing]

485
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,263
[narrator]
<i>And while wickedness crawled the land,</i>

486
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:01,142
<i>happily-ever-after remained
just out of reach for some.</i>

487
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,025
- Oh, Jesus.
- [chuckles] Look like you've seen a ghost.

488
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,820
Just a little jumpy
these days, I'm afraid.

489
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,281
Yeah, you're not the only one, neighbor.

490
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,325
Jeez, Adi. Why don't you just burn it?

491
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,452
Put down some wood chip instead.

492
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,330
We can't solve
every problem with fire, Bob.

493
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,417
Some things we have to deal with head on.

494
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,713
- Speaking of, take extra, for Rani.
- Uh...

495
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,135
What makes you think she's missing?

496
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,928
No one's seen her for three days, Adi.

497
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,805
Three days, huh?

498
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,100
She lives next door. You haven't noticed?

499
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,645
Well, we haven't seen Nancie
since, eh, Doug's party,

500
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,398
but then again,
we haven't been keeping track.

501
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,027
Sure she'll be flattered to see you made
these when she turns up, though, ay?

502
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,612
- Let's hope so.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

503
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,447
How's Rani doing, by the way?

504
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,991
I haven't seen her lately.

505
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,535
Well, you know, since, uh,

506
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,623
Doug's party, she's been busy
sanitizing our entire house

507
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,416
'cause we've got those, um...

508
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,628
Those granite counters.

509
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,673
Oh, you really got
to get in the grout with those.

510
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:18,219
Hey, thanks for the tip, Bob.
You're... You're a good man.

511
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,597
[Bob] We're relying on you, you know.

512
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,224
To keep us healthy, vigilant.

513
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,935
If there's another wave
of this thing coming,

514
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,021
we're gonna need you, pal.

515
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,104
Hey.

516
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,483
[utensil clatters]

517
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,860
- At your service, huh?
- You too. See you.

518
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,742
[door opens, closes]

519
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,372
[Rani sighs]

520
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,834
Promise me, if I ever go missing,
you'll pick a better photo.

521
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,712
It was all I could do
just to keep it together.

522
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,089
You know? I thought he knew.

523
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,715
Adi, we didn't do anything.

524
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,092
Exactly.

525
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,053
That... That's as good as killing her.

526
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,736
[Rani] Did you kick Nancie in the chest?

527
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,182
- No.
- Did I kick Nancie in the chest?

528
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,308
No.

529
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,978
There you go. If you want
