00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,242
Okay, so then
you test the vaccines on the chickens?

178
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,369
No, we need their eggs.

179
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,705
So, we inject the eggs with the microbes.

180
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,206
Mostly viruses.

181
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,586
And then,
if we incubate just the right ones,

182
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,713
then we grow vaccines.

183
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,090
And we save a lot of lives.

184
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,385
Okay, and what happens
if you inject the wrong ones?

185
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,178
[inhales]

186
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,472
All hell breaks loose.

187
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,394
[bartender] Last call, everyone.

188
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,737
[soft piano music playing]

189
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,413
I'll walk you to your car?

190
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,082
I walked here. I live a few blocks away.

191
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,419
Oh, well... I could walk with you.

192
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,505
Just to make sure you get home safe.

193
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,174
Right.

194
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,135
[chuckles] Just to make sure
I get home safe. Okay.

195
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,767

[pensive music playing]

198
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,790
I never thought I'd say this, but...

199
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,210
I don't think I can eat one more piece.

200
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,293
I'll eat it.

201
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,338
No more after that.

202
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,048
Your teeth will fall out.

203
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,341
How many have you had?

204
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,677
One, two, three, four...

205
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,178
I'm capping you at six.

206
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,930
You'll have to catch me first!

207
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,181
Deal.

208
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,058
[Bear] He beats you in a race every time.

209
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,601
[Jepperd] I let him every time.

210
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,977
Sure you do.

211
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,061
[exhales]

212
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,648
I bet my mom'll have food at her place.

213
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,361
And, I know I shouldn't ask,

214
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,321
but are we close?

215
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:42,118
According to this, Goss Grove
should be just about a mile north.

216
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,203
Yes! And what's a mile again?

217
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,621
About 2,000 steps.

218
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,502
[Gus] One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

219
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,462
He thinks
she's gonna feed him dinner tonight.

220
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,506
Yeah, well, keep it down.

221
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,137
So, what's the plan, Big Man?

222
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,514
I don't know, Little Girl.

223
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,936
What are we gonna do when he finds
his mom's house and she's dead? Or worse?

224
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,564
You and me can handle
disappointment and heartbreak,

225
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,858
but Gus is so...

226
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,693
[ominous music playing]

227
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,776
Gus.

228
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,903
You're right.

229
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,697
Excuse me?

230
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,615
What?

231
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,745
I think you just said I was right.

232
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,832
Maybe he ought to go with you
when this is done.

233
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,419
You said you were hooking up
with those hybrid-saving people.

234
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,006
Maybe this is one you should save.

235
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,425
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

236
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,988
[Jepperd] Come on, it's a great idea.

237
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,179
- You like the kid, right?
- Well, yeah.

238
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,096
He likes you.

239
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,765
It's not that simple.

240
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,850
It's...

241
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,229
You're not actually going there, are you?

242
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,731
I knew it.

243
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,317
Do these people even exist?

244
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:57,984
I think so.

245
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,322
I was thinking about looking for them.

246
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,325
Has anything you've said been true?

247
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,869
I hate adults.

248
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,664
- [exhales]
- Look, I didn't know where else to go.

249
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,708
And you guys needed
to get to the train, so...

250
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,295
So what now?

251
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,589
I don't know. I thought you had a plan.

252
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,674
[Jepperd] I'll talk to him.

253
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,052
I'll let him down gently.

254
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,845
You don't do gentle.

255
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,306
Hey, guys!

256
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,474
Look!

There's smoke coming out of the chimney.

259
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,525
There's no way.

260
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,318
- Huh?
- Right?

261
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,369
[birds chirping]

262
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,371
[Pubba] Ah, Orion's out tonight.

264
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,874
[Pubba] Uh, the Mriga.

265
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,958
Says who?

266
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,086
Two and half years of Eastern studies.

267
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,045
A half?

268
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,297
Yeah, I'm not great at finishing things.

269
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,384
It means the deer.

270
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,552
[Birdie] Hmm.

271
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,933
What?

272
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,518
Nothing.

273
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,478
This is me.

274
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,570
Do you want some hot chocolate?

275
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,446
[chuckles] Hot chocolate?

276
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,781
Sure.

277
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,411
I have a real bad sweet tooth.
Don't tell anyone.

Mm-hmm.

- [Pubba] Oh, you look great.
- Mm-mm.

It's my husband's favorite.

Oh, you're married?

290
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:05,987
Was.

291
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,781
Divorced?

No, it's fine.

295
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,707
I mean, it's not fine that he's dead,
but it was a while ago.

296
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,500
- I was still teaching.
- Okay.

00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,168
Sorry. [titters]

298
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,130
Can I ask how it happened?

It only affects one percent of people.

That's when I abandoned
the classroom for the lab.

301
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,183
Thought if I couldn't save him,
then I'd save someone else.

302
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,266
Here.

303
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,561

Yeah.

[Pubba sniffs]

306
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,320
- So what were you drawing?
- Hmm?

307
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,406
At the bar, you were drawing...
You were very into your drawing.

308
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,658
Oh.

309
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,243
I don't know. Some little characters.

310

Creating little worlds
out of nothing, you know?

312
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,461
In another life, I'd probably
be drawing children's books.

313
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,421
What about in this life?

314
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,008
Not sure if it's meant to be. Um...

315
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,803
Besides,
I'm not really great at the story part.

316
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,765
I mean, everyone's got
a good story in them.

317
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,017
Maybe you just haven't found yours yet.

318
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,727
One day.

319
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,357
My job at the lab
was not really part of my long-term plan,

320
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,985
you know, but it pays the bills,

321
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,530
and turns out
I'm naturally gifted at fixing things.

you make great hot chocolate.

It's a science, not an art form.

324
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,663
Yeah.

325
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,964
You have...

00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,675
Sorry. [chuckles]

You can come closer here
if you want. [titters]

329
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,141
What?

330
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,559
You can come closer.

331
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,184
All right.

I'm so sorry. Um...

Hey. Everything okay?

00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,049
What?

340
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,216
Where?

341
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,304
- Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. I'm coming.

Is everything cool?

00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,062
No. The military is taking over the lab
and they are seizing everything.

- When?
- Uh, right now.

346
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,940
So I'm guessing by your expression,
that's bad?

347
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,525
Yes, it's very bad.

348
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:53,280
Judy hid my project in a storage closet,
but I need to get to the lab right now.

Okay. Birdie,
it's almost two in the morning.

I can't get inside.

00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,665
This is bad. This is very bad. Oh, my God.

353
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,292
What am I gonna do?

00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:09,963
Would these help?

356
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,593
- You don't have to do that.
- Are you kidding?

357
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,347
Tonight's been the most exciting thing
that's possibly ever happened to me.

358
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,933
Come on, I'll drive.

359
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,602
Okay.

360
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,062
[music swells]

361
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,188
This is it!

362
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,273
Someone's home.

363
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,275
How many, kid?

364
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,653
Just one.

365
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,447
- [gate creaking]
- [ominous music playing]

366
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,925
- [Jepperd] Hey.
- [Bear] Wait, Gus.

367
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,783
[Jepperd] Gus.

368
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,660
I told you guys she'd be here.

369
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,120
- [Bear] Hold on.
- [Jepperd] Gus.

370
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,203
[Gus] Hello?

371
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,623
Hello?

372
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,168
Gus, listen, you can't
just run up on people and...

373
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,252
- [Gus] Hello?
- Gus.

374
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,254
[woman] Go away!

375
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,922
[Gus] Mom?

376
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,008
It's me. Open up.

377
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,468
[door creaking]

378
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,928
[woman] Get off my porch!

379
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,638
- Hey, lady.
- [breathing heavily]

380
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,391
Lady, we're not here to hurt you.

381
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,312
Your name's not Birdie, is it?

382
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,983
Say that again?

383
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,443
Birdie. She's my mom.

384
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,947
[door unlocks]

385
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,703
Gus?

386
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,081
You...

387
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,215
You're still alive.

388
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,551
[music builds to climax]

389
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,887
- [people clamoring]
- [helicopter whirring]

390
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,680
[suspenseful music playing]

391
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,692
[keys jingling]

392
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,654
[Pubba] I still don't understand why the
military wants to shut this place down.

393
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,698
Remember when I said
hell would break loose?

394
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,118
Wait a minute. What exactly did you make?

395
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,619
You'll see.

396
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,546
[woman] Hope you like blueberry wine.

397
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,965
So how long have you lived here, Miss...

398
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,009
[woman] Ever since things went to shit.

399
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,677
Call me Judy.

400
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,722
How do you know Birdie?

401
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,391
We used to work together.

402
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,560
Oh, and then one day...

403
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,813
she saved my life.

404
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,398
Whoa.

405
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,403
I came back to check on her here
when the Sick started.

406
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,822
Found people ransacking the place.

407
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,407
I tried to stop them, but...

408
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,908
[clears throat]

409
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,119
They left me for dead.

410
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,621
Last Men?

411
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,331
[Judy] It was before their time.

412
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,250
It was the military.

413
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,419
Your mother found me.

414
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,505
Took care of me. Nursed me back.

415
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,341
She let me stay here with her.

416
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,510
So, she's a doctor?

417
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,719
Well, not exactly.

418
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,852
She doesn't live here anymore, does she?

419
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,650
I'm afraid not.

420
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,448
So, where did Birdie go?

421
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,908
[Judy] I honestly don't know.

422
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,413
One night she packed a bag
and she went out to look for you.

423
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,374
I begged her not to go.

424
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,168
But she wouldn't listen.

425
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,671
That was ten years ago.

426
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,550
And I've been alone here ever since.

427
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,221
[church bells chiming]

428
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,897
[suspenseful music playing]

429
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,274
Fort Smith.

430
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,192
Sorry?

431
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,610
The flower holder.

432
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,654
It says "Fort Smith Labs."

433
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,495
- It's the same as Pubba's!
- What's a Pubba?

434
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,830
It's his dad.

435
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,498
What does Fort Smith Labs mean?

436
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,875
[Judy] That's where we worked.

437
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,543
She was a scientist.

438
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,546
So, that means Pubba was a scientist too.

439
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,384
Richard Fox.

440
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,011
You knew my Pubba?

441
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,183
[Judy sighs]

442
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,608
- [keypad beeping]
- [lock clicks]

443
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,534
Thanks.

444
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,455
What's it for?

445
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,873
It's for the attic.

446
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,502
Birdie asked me to keep it safe,
in case anyone came looking,

447
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,587
but I think she'd want you to see it.

448
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,755
Let's go!

449
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,343
Oh, man.

450
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:07,844
[ominous music playing]

451
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,680
Hey, does Fort Smith
sound familiar to you?

452
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,891
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

453
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,143
They closed it
when the virus began to spread.

454
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,687
Rumor was
it was where the virus first started.

455
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,231
[Gus] Hey, you guys coming?

456
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,982
Uh, yeah.

457
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,069
[music builds to a climax]

458
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,278
[whispering] This way.

459
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,280
[suspenseful music playing]

460
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,418
- [people clamoring]
- [machinery whirring]

461
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,973
Oh, no.

462
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,392
[music swells]

463
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,739
[Jepperd] Here.

464
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,415
I'm pretty sure
this is how most horror films start.

465
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,170
[suspenseful music playing]

466
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,423
[whispering] I can honestly say this is
not how I thought this night would go.

467
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,342
You've never had to break into
a laboratory on a date before?

468
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,428
Wait, this is a date?

469
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,512
Keys.

470
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,309
[Pubba] Got it. Got it.

471
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,564
[sniffs]

472
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,151
Mama smells like peaches.

473
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,903
[hopeful music playing]

474
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,070
More like mothballs.

475
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,581
Hey. Did it seem like
Judy knew more than she was telling us?

476
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,291
A hundred percent.

477
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
[Jepperd sighs]

478
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,088
[whispers] I think it's time.

479
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,589
Yeah.

480
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,635
It's her!

481
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,971
Jepp, who's that old guy
in the photo with her?

482
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,348
[Jepperd] It's probably her dad.

483
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,850
Wait, so...

484
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,268
He'd be your grandpa.

485
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,853
My grandpubba?

486
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,438
Jepp, I have a grandpubba!

487
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,814
Yeah, that's nice.

488
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,733
Um...

489
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:31,947
We need to talk.

490
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,368
I heard you talking earlier,
and I know what you're gonna say.

491
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,995
You think this is a waste of time,

492
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,372
but you're wrong.

493
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,165
Look how far we've come.

494
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,460
We're standing
in the middle of my mom's house.

495
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,046
You never thought that we'd get this far.

496
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,713
Admit it.

497
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,135
I know you've given up on a lot of things,

498
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,097
but that doesn't mean
I have to give up too.

499
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,391
None of us should.

500
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,157
Uh, Jepp?

501
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,786
I think you need to see this.

502
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,748
[suspenseful music playing]

503
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,292
[Pubba] What the hell is this thing?

504
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,127
[Birdie] The microbe I told you about?

505
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,795
- [machinery beeping]
- Yeah.

506
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,716
We accidentally made a miracle...

507
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,261
and created this.

508
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,308
[Pubba whispers] What...

509
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,353
My God.

510
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,689
Hey, buddy.

511
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,024
[baby cooing]

512
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,697
[chuckles]

513
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,780
He likes you.

514
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,536
What is he?

515
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,585
[Gus] G-U-S. It spells out my name.

516
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,588
[ominous music playing]

517
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,008
"Genetic Unit Series 1"?

518
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:16,884
What does that mean?

519
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,596
It's nothing. It's probably nothing.

520
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,223
Well, what is it?

521
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,476
What's a genetic unit?

522
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,438
[Bear] It looks like a project
your mom was working on.

523
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,484
What do you mean, "project"?

524
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,448
What is it?

525
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,333
That's me, isn't it?

526
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,086
I think so, kid.

527
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,838
[Gus] Who are all the people with Birdie?

528
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,048
Where's Pubba?

529
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,013
- [heart monitor beeping]
- [heart pounding]

530
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,058
Why are there tubes sticking out of me?
Was I sick?

531
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,143
- [heart rate increases]
- Hi.

532
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,937
Morning, Gus.

533
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,440
Gus, meet Richard.

534
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,900
Hey, Gus.

535
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,318

539
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,579
- [soldier] Okay! Open it up!
- We have to get him out of here.

540
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,915
- They're outside the door.
- You don't understand.

541
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,627
If they get him on that truck,
they'll dissect him and experiment on him.

542
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,586
It's okay, buddy.

543
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,463
Look, I'll distract them. Okay?

544
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,340
[shushing] What are you talking about?

545
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,717
I have a plan.

546
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:41,678
It's okay.

[soldier] Hey, you!

551
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,954
Yeah, you. What the hell are you doing?

552
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,080
What's it look like?

553
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,875
I'm... I'm vacuuming.
These carpets are a lint magnet.

554
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,628
This is a classified area.

555
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,172
You need to leave now.

556
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,049
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know
what would be really great

557
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,552
is if you would stop, like,
walking where I'm cleaning.

558
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,971
Otherwise it's going
to take me twice as long.

559
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,558
All non-essential personnel
must leave immediately.

560
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,561
Okay, okay. You've just got
to take it up with my supervisor.

561
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,145
Who is this guy?

562
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,315
Richard. I'm... I'm Richard Fox.

563

[Gus crying]

564
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,442
Go, now.

[Gus]<i> Where's Pubba?</i>

566
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,078
- Where's Pubba?
- Gus? I want you to listen to me, okay?

567
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,371
No, I need to find Pubba.

568
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,540
[Jepperd] Gus. Listen to Bear.

569
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,335
I never told you this, but I was adopted.

570
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,961
Do you know what that means?

571
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,964
It means that
your parents aren't your parents.

572
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,760
No. No, no, no. It means they were
as much my parents as my biological...

573
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,637
Stop using big words!

574
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,764
It just means that
her parents didn't make her

575
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,099
the same way
other kids' parents made them.

576
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,935
What are you saying?

577
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,816
They're still my parents, right?

578
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,695
Right?

579
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,114
- It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
- [Gus crying]

580
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,201
Everything's gonna be okay, okay? Okay?

581
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,453
Everything's gonna be okay.

582
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,289
We're gonna keep you safe,
all right? All right?

583
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,542
Me and that nice man.

584
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,171
You'll always be...

585
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,923

This way.

589
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,895
Come on! This is the way.

590

[somber music playing]

591
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,690
I have to go back.

592
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:00,984
Are you crazy?

593
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,569
No, you need to take Gus.

594
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,904
- You need to take Gus right now, okay?
- What?

595
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,991
It's okay. I need to go back.
I need to get all of my research,

596
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,701
and I need to burn the place down.

597
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,703
That research and what we've been doing,

598
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,581
in the wrong hands
will kill millions of people.

599

[Gus crying]

600
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,043
- You need to take Gus now.
- Listen, I just met you, all right?

601
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,171
And you seem nice, but I can't do this.

602
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,381
I'm nobody.

603
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:27,719
Exactly, you're nobody, they won't come
looking for you, so you can keep Gus safe.

604
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,846
- Oh, God.
- Did you hear? Keep him safe.

[Gus cooing]

608
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,905
I don't know anything about babies.

609

Don't ask questions
you don't want answers to.

Tell me.

616
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,527
It seems like these scientists

617
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,073
may have created you.

618
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,705
[Bear]
Hey. But this doesn't change anything.

619
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,334
Yes, it does.

620
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,878
It changes everything.

621
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,215
That's why he never talked about her.

622
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,717
Well, maybe he was trying to protect you.

623
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,886
If scientists created me,

624
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,264
I don't have a mom, do I?

625
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,850
Or a dad.

We don't know the whole story yet.

627
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:04,065
But he did raise you on his own
and kept you safe.

Most people wouldn't have done that.
Trust me.

629
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,486
He lied to me! About everything!

630

Gus, come on. Let's get some air.

No! I'm not listening to you anymore.
