Yeah, but why do you think they did it?

that's entirely up to you.</i>

178

<i>Does the name "Laika"
mean anything to you?</i>

179
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,871
She was a lucky dog,

180
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,750
a mutt from the streets of Moscow.

181
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:14,382
The Soviets launched Laika into
outer space in the name of science.

182
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,633
She never made it back.

183
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,259
Bummer.

184
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,637
But had it not been
for our sweet little Laika,

185
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,099
humans would never
have traveled to the stars.

186
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,979
You've collected quite a few Laikas
in your little zoo, haven't you?

187
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,773
I'm gonna stop you right there.

188
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,276
Whatever it is you're selling,

189
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,611

I probably didn't make myself clear.

My friends and I, we're not leaving.

193
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,205
And did I mention
I have brought a few friends?

194
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,667
There are only two goals
when it comes to these little freaks:

195
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,254
extermination and experimentation.

196
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,380
The problem is,

197
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,092
if you're really, really good
at the extermination part,

198
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,178
we find ourselves with
nowhere near the numbers we need

199
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,723
to experiment on these little rodents.

200
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,224
That's where you come in.

201
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,770

You're a dinosaur, Abbot.

They're better than us.

Is... Is it human?

358
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,861
He and his mom are healthy and resting.

359
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,944
Congratulations.

360
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,201
Is it human?

361
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,787
[nurse] Would you like to see him?

362
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,502
They're just running
some last tests on your wife,

363
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,504
and then she can come and join you both.

364
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,841
Take your time.

What kind is it?

376
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,189
Huh?

377
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,066
Your baby, what kind?

378
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,528
I don't know.

379
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,281
It was one of those things.

Hey.

383
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,585
Hey!

384
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,424
You'll be surprised
what you're capable of

385
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,177
when it's for someone you love.

[sighs]

398
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,433
I'm gonna put out these porch lights.

399
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,603
What was really going on at Fort Smith?

400
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,354
That's another lifetime ago.

401
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,899
Why did they make Gus?

402
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,613
How did you do it?

403
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,698
[sighs]

404
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,535
Well, Gus was all Birdie.

405
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,831
But Fort Smith wasn't just about Gus.

406
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,041
I know.

407
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,585
It was about the virus too, wasn't it?

408
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,670
Why does it matter now?

409
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,675
What does the virus
have to do with kids like Gus?

410
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,013
[melancholic music playing]

411
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,060
[inhales] I once heard her say
they were two sides of the same coin.

412
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,105
But she wouldn't tell me
any more than that.

413
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,485
So why have you been
protecting her work for all these years?

414
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,487
[Judy] Because she was my best friend.

415
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,573
She was family to me.

416
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,495
Like a sister.

417
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,331
When she left me here...

418
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,418
Well, I had nowhere else to go.

419
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,800
[exhales] I mean, do you have
any idea what that's like?

420
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,467
Yes.

421
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,097
I know exactly what that's like.

422
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,226
[propeller screeching]

423
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,689
[Gus] I'm not coming back.

[Jepperd grunts]

427
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,682
Hey.

428
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,684
Stick together.

429
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,358
You lose that thing,
you'll regret it the rest of your life.

430
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,154
You broke all your gold men.

431
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,906
And look how I turned out.

432
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,286
I'd keep this stuff.

433
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,372
That's all you got of your dad.

434
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,039
What dad?

435
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,168
I don't have one.

436
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,796
I don't have anyone.

437
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:19,923
Just me.

438
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,515
I never should have crossed the fence.

439
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,560
I should have just stayed in the woods.

440
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,645
None of this would have ever happened.

441
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,730
None of what?

442
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:36,982
[Gus sighs]

443
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,318
Everything.

444
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,073
Everything's stupid.
Everyone wants to kill me.

445
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,075
Everyone lies.

446
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,163
Well, he did his best.

447
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,584
Then why couldn't he
just tell me the truth?

448
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,835
Being honest

449
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,922
is hard sometimes.

450
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:04,594
All that stuff back in the attic, at least
we know one thing he said was true.

451
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,387
You're a special kid.

452
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,475
I don't want to be special.
I want to be like everyone else.

453
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,852
I want to be with kids like me.

454
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,479
You said they were out there.

455
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,151
I'm gonna go to the Preserve.

456
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,655
Because I'm sick of being the weird one.

457
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,658
If there's anyone out there like me,

458
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,035
I wanna meet 'em.

459
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,330
I wanna see what they're like.

460
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,543
You know,

461
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,547
back when everything was falling apart...

462
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,259
I had a little baby.

463
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,389
A lot like you.

464
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,143
When I saw him,

465
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,355
I had no clue what to do with him.

466
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,233
I didn't even know what he was.

467
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,570
I mean, nobody knew
what to think in those days.

468
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,367
I mean, how could I be responsible
for a little, I mean...

469
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,245
So I wanted to run away too.

470
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,583
What happened?

471
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,084
Oh, I thought about it.

472
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,671
[inhales]
And I realized I was just scared.

473
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,757
I wasn't afraid of him.

474
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,428
I was afraid of me.

475
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,352
I think that fear was...

476
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,358
love that I didn't know what to do with.

477
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,989
But he needed me.

478
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,744
<i>So I stopped running.</i>

479
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,414
<i>I turned around.</i>

480
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,501
<i>And I went back to get him.</i>

481
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,837
Him and his mom.

482
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,802
[inhales] But they were already gone.

483
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,766
Someone had took 'em.

484
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,312
And I never saw them again.

485
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,194
[inhales]

486
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,404
I hurt a lot of people, Little Man.

487
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,409
Usually on purpose.

488
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,706
But sometimes I don't mean to hurt 'em.

489
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,044
Sometimes I just make bad decisions.

490
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,215
But you know what?

491
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,594
I think you're one of the good ones.

492
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,518
[inhales, exhales deeply]

493
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,648
Don't make me lose you too.

494
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,196
Come back with me.

495
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,157
And go where?

496
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,034
Anywhere we want.

497
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,662
What would we do?

498
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,248
Anything we want to do.

499
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,041
I could teach you stuff.

500
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,502
You can teach me...
What was that game called?

501
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,461
Pass the Ball?

502
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,921
That's the one.

503
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,881
We'll need a ball.

504
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,259
I think we can find one.

505
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,137
Maybe you can show me
how to make that syrup.

506
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,222
We need maple trees.

507
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,348
We'll find some.

508
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,560
Like, we need lots of them.

509
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,978
[Jepperd] We'll find a forest.

510
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,732
Maybe even live there.

511
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,901
Together?

512
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,156
Why do you think I'm here?

513
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,199
Can Bear come too?

514
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,453
I'll have to think about that one.

515
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,080
[both chuckle]

516
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,585
So, what should we say
to the Preserve when they get here?

517
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,547
What do you mean?

518
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:15,595
Don't get mad, but I kind of called them,
and they said that they were on their way.

519
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,973
Look, I fixed it.

Big Man?

Big Man, wake up!
They're coming! They're here!

[Abbot] He was one of us.

Traitor.

535
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,036
