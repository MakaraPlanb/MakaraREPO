00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,236
[Gus straining]

181
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,529
Uh...

182
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,783
Dad?

183
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,412
[Gus moaning, straining]

184
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,501
- Leave my head alone! You can't have it!
- [ominous music builds]

185
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,795
[glass shattering]

186
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,731
You get many visitors?

187
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,442
Never.

188
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,905
Then you can take off your masks.

189
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,949
I don't have the Sick.

190
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,996
If you've been isolated out here,
then you don't, either.

191
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,876
[woman] Is the virus still out there?

192
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,044
[Big Man] Comes and goes.

193
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,004
- [Gus crunching]
- What about...

194
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,134
[Big Man] Critters don't get sick
and they can't spread it, either.

195
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,429
I don't know why
people still believe that.

196
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,144
We don't get out much.

197
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,942
Rusty!

198
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,821
Not at the table.

199
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,198
Go on to your room.

200
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,159
Hold on.

201
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,540
All better.

202
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,374
Thank you.

203
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,842
Are you Rusty's mom?

204
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,263
- I never met a mom before.
- Don't get him started.

205
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,934
Who taught you to talk?

206
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,270
My Pubba did. He made me do school.

207
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,980
I figure the Sick got him.

208
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,066
- Do you know Birdie?
- Excuse me?

209
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,695
My mama. We're trying to find her.

210
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,033
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know her.

211
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,870
She looks very nice, though.

212
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,538
I tried to tell him,

213
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,125
she ain't out there,
but he's stubborn as hell.

214
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,905
How do you guys know each other?

215
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,795
- We don't.
- He's taking me to Colorado.

216
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,550
How old are you, Gus?

217
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,343
I'm ten, I think.

218
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,554
Isn't that old for one of them?

219
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,637
How old's Rusty?

220
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,015
He's 11.

221
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,975
He's one of the last, uh...

222
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,310
One of the last

223
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,770
human babies before...

224
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,733
Before all kids were born
like you. [titters]

225
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,484
Can I go play with him?

226
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,237
I... I don't know.

227
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,031
Does he bite?

228
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,410
Do you bite?

229
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,998
- Go on, then, Sweet Tooth.
- [sucks fingers]

230
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,708
[whispering] Yeah, okay.

231
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,462
[tense music playing]

232
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,005
[thunder rumbling]

233
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,722
[thunder rumbling]

234
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,901
[gentle music playing]

235
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,529
Did you know
they used to send people to the moon?

236
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,660
My dad said they used to make people
go to outer space and stuff.

237
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,291
Have you ever been to the moon?

238
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,293
No. I went to a mall one time.

239
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,549
Do you poop pellets?

240
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,635
No.

241
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,930
Are your ears soft,
or are they gross like pig ears?

242
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,975
I forget I have them sometimes.

243
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,477
Except when they're itchy.

244
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,689
I had a golden retriever named Snickers,

245
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,567
and I used to scratch his ears,
and his leg would kick a lot.

246
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,777
Do you do that?

247
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,528
Um...

248
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,572
I don't know.

249
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,032
Can I try?

250
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,959
- [both giggling]
- [hopeful music playing]

251
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,085
[chuckles] Super cool.

252
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,380
- Do you know how to play trains?
- [Gus] Yeah. What's a train?

253
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,841
It's like a caterpillar, and it goes fast.

254
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,342
So how do I play it?

255
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,886
Put your hand on it,
and then you push it.

256
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,114
- [Gus gasps]
- [Rusty giggles]

257
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,347
It's so fun.

258
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,431

00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,144

[beer can opening]

261
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,816
Are you who I think you are?

262
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,028
I don't know, am I?

263
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,947
[chuckles] You know, the football guy.

264
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,158
You... you played for the... What was it...

265
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,617
The Gators?

266
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,077
- Guardians.
- Right.

267
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,079
- Timmy Jepperd.
- Tommy.

268
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,289
[man chuckles]

269
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,291
[thunder rumbling]

270
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,217
So, where were you when it all went...

271
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,969
[sighs]

272
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,056
Try not to think about it.

273
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,765
[man] Understandable.

274
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,601
Bev was at work.

275
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,021
[exhales] We both were, actually.

276
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,523
We barely saw each other
back then, really.

277
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,401
Guess in a lot of ways,
everything falling apart

278
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,236
actually brought us together as a family.

279
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,113
Yeah, you're lucky you made it.

280
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,950
That's 'cause no one knows we're here.

281
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,077
Hmm.

282
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,164
What do you want from us?

283
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,127
I wanna spend the night,
wait out the storm.

284
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,880
- I should talk to Bev first.
- I wasn't asking.

285
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,136
We don't want any trouble.

286
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,391
That makes two of us.

287
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,019
[sinister music playing]

288
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,445
[Last Man] Campfire.

289
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,086
Move out and look for him.

290
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,379
[thunder rumbling]

291
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,005
- [Gus] Marco.
- [Rusty] Polo.

[toy gun cocking]

295
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,226
Marco.

296
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,144
[whispers] Polo.

297
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,478
- [bullet whooshing]
- [grunts]

298
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,357
Not Fair! He hears <i>everything,</i> Mom!

299
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,111
He's not like you, honey. You have
to find a game you're both good at.

300
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,363
Why don't you show Gus your records?

301
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,201
- [record player clicking]

- Oh, come on, I have all the vowels again.

- What?

X-I is not a word!

[groans]
I really miss having the Internet.

334
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,374
You miss the Internet
so you can double-check me on Scrabble?

335
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,836
Well, for that and other things,
but mostly...

336
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,921
that. Boom!

I should head to Dr. Bell.

Can you at least
bring me back some french fries?

And an apple pie?

353
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,991
- And a strawberry milkshake.
- Oh, gee.

354
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,284
[both laughing]

355
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,368
Hey.

356
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,953
I love you.

357
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,456
I love you.

358
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,754
Ooh.

359
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,218
[grunts, exhales]

360
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,135
[sighs]

361
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,472
You ready for a ride, Trixie?

362
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,035
- Hey? [smooches]
- [Trixie nickering]

363
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,099
Come on.

364
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,769
[repetitive acoustic guitar music playing]

365
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,040
[whistling]

366
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,422
- Hey, Adi.
- [Dr. Singh] Hey, Bob.

367
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,843
[gate buzzes, creaks open]

368
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,764
- You two stay safe out there.
- Yeah, we will.

369
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,891
You're a good man, Bob.

370
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,601
[door alarm beeping]

371
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,534
[clears throat]

372
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,618
How are you?

373
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,121
Where's Kevin?

374
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,457
Oh, split a few days ago.

375
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,710
He heard they were starting
new safe zones on the east coast.

376
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,421
Didn't know there was
an east coast anymore. [snickers]

377
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,508
Between the two of us,
Kevin was getting suburban cabin fever,

378
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,843
so he'd use any excuse to get out of here.

379
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,638
Are you feeling okay?

380
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,390
Yeah, yeah, just a routine checkup.

381
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,977
You know,
it's easy to lose track of the days.

382
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,104
- Don't I know it. Wrist, please.
- Yeah, sorry.

383
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,357
[machine buzzing]

384
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,901
[beeping]

385
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,486
All good. Take a seat.

386
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,569
Thanks.

387
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,078
[distant coughing]

388
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,753

00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,094
[radio interference]

391
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,054
[box clattering]

392
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,267
[ominous music building]

393
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,352
[receptionist]
Thank you. See you next week.

394
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,669
- [receptionist] Mr. Singh?
- Yes.

395
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,361
The doctor will see you now.

396
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,249
[Dr. Singh] Busy as usual tonight?

397
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,458
Refill?

398
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,087
Yeah. Thanks.

399
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,676
How long have the doses been lasting?

400
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,805
Um, about 28 days
she's in full remission, and then...

401
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,473
And then the Sick comes back?

402
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,392
Yeah.

403
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,186
Any symptoms with this new cocktail?

404
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,148
A small rash on her leg, slight nausea,

405
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,816
but, uh, her energy levels are up.

406
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,651
Must be inching closer to a cure.

407
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,906
It's funny, you've been saying
the same thing for the past ten years,

408
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,785
and I still can't tell if you're
talking to me as a relative of a patient

409
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,869
or as a colleague.

410
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,750
What's this?

411
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,917
All my records.

412
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:12,422
Detailed documentation
of every trial version I've used on Rani,

413
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,424
what has worked and what hasn't.

414
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,094
You want me to help keep track?
You know my medical days are over.

415
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,888
They don't have to be.

416
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,514
[ominous music playing]

417
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:26,478
I prefer it on the sidelines, you know,
less screaming and mass death.

418
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,606
- You know what I went through.
- What we all went through.

419
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,194
I wouldn't be asking you
if I had any other choice.

420
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,449
What aren't you saying, Gladys?

421
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,161
Before everything happened...

422
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:48,958
I used to preach to all my patients that
mammograms have saved countless women.

423
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,502
But since the virus hit,

424
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,464
cancer has been a secondary concern.

425
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,782
The thought of something inside you

426
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,260
and taking you down slowly
seems like a luxury.

427
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,932
How far along are you?

428
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,394
I'm pretty sure it's stage four now.

429
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,312
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

430
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,564
I don't know what to say.

431
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,733
Say you'll continue the work I started.

432
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,568
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

433
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,613
That is what the book is for.

434
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,826
Now, I've had to do
a lot of things that I'm not proud of.

435
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,914
But you, of all people, know that
this new world is all about survival,

436
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,874
no matter the cost.

437
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,958
[sighs]

438
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,962
Rani is alive today because of you,

439
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,215
and, um, we're both forever grateful...

440
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,050
You know, there was a time

441
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,430
when I was convinced my purpose
was to find the cure to the virus,

442
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,432
but now I know I was wrong.

443
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,184
It's yours.

444
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,272
How can you be so sure?

445
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:56,067
Because there's nothing that
you wouldn't do for your wife, Dr. Singh.

446
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,821
And that is exactly
what it's going to take.

447
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,825
[thunder rumbling]

448
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,620
[Dr. Singh exhales]

449
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,710
What's wrong?

450
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,507
Did she run out of medicine again?

451
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,593
No, she's... she's gone.

452
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,262
I don't understand.

453
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,225
She's left instructions.
It's up to me now to make your medicine.

454
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,228
[Rani exhales]

455
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,563
[ominous music playing]

456
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,940
You're acting like this is a bad thing.

457
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,570
I can't think of anything better than
my own husband keeping me healthy.

458
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,823
- My personal hero...
- No, you don't understand what she's been...

459
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,743
What she's been doing. It's...

460
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,828
[exhales]

461
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,330
[Rani] What is it, Adi?

462
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,878
It goes against
everything that we believe in.

463
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,425
I don't think I can do it.

464
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,801
- [music builds]
- [Rani inhales sharply]

465
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,885
[exhales sharply]

466
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,819
[sighs]

467
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,534
MRE tokens.

468
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,661
You can trade them in for military food.

469
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,039
I'm only taking what I need
to get back to the Market.

470
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,250
We don't want your money.

471
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,919
I'd offer you meds, but he lost all mine.

472
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,132
- What are you doing with him?
- Trying to get rid of him.

473
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,301
Easier said than done.

474
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,678
You're one of them,

475
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,761
aren't you?

476
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,056
I, uh...

477
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,642
saw your mark.

478
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,686
Not anymore.

479
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,188
How many people have you killed?

480
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,691
- Can we not do this?
- Did they all deserve it?

481
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,111
Did you come here for my family?

482
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,697
My son?

483
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,449
I came here for food.

484
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,993
Look, lady,

485
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,163
I did what I had to, to survive.

486
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,540
Just like everyone else.

487
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,628
We never stole.

488
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,880
Or kidnapped.

489
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,590
And we never killed anyone.

490
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:10,053
That's because people like you
had people like me to do it for you.

491
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,307
He believes you're gonna look after him.

492
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,476
He believes whatever the hell he wants.

493
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,478
If it were up to me...

494
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,649
there'd be no such thing as kids like him.

495
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,108
Then why did you save him?

496
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,235
Doesn't matter.

497
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,616
I got an idea.

498
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,994
[somber music playing]

499
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,537
Why don't you take him?

500
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,417
I saved him, you keep him.
He's better off here than out there.

501
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,628
What about his mom?

502
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,673
You're the closest thing
he'll ever have to a mom.

503
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,060
I have to... talk to George.

504
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,312
Good. Tell him you're out of beans.

505
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,359
[thunder rumbling]

506
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,284
Have you met kids like me before?

507
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,789
This one time,
we saw a bobcat girl in the woods,

508
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,333
but she didn't talk like you.

509
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,460
My dad scared her off.

510
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,211
Why?

511
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,631
He said 'cause it's animal kids' fault.

512
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,425
What is?

513
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,302
Making everyone get sick and die.

514
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,642
Hey, my Pubba wrote that.

515
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,145
[Rusty] Who?

516
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,814
My Pubba, he wrote lots of books.

517
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,444
That's not what
<i>The Velveteen Rabbit </i>looks like.

518
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,321
[chuckles] Who drew this?

519
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,366
His eyes are crazy.

520
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,870
He looks like he's got boogers.

521
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,585
[melancholic music playing]

522
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,760
Have you seen any fires?

523
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,137
What?

524
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,687
Outside,
there's supposed to be fires everywhere.

525
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,133
[Rusty] You're weird, Sweet Tooth.

526
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,691
Super weird.

527
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,028
[Bev] Boys, bed time.

528
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,623
What's it like having a mom?

529
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,125
It's cool, I guess.
