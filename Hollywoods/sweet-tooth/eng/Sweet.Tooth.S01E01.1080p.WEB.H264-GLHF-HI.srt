Pubba!

Pubba!

180
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,877
[Pubba] Hey, I'm here.

181
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
I got you.

182
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,343
It's just Mother Nature, Gus,
washing her world clean.

183
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,290
Can we live on a raft
in the river, like Huck?

184
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,211
There are no rivers inside the fence,
Gus, you know that.

185
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,255
[Gus] What about out there?

186
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,883
Well, I told you we can't go out there.

187
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,844
Why not?

188
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,137
Because I said so.

189
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,266
You said when I'm old enough,
you'll tell me.

190
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,684
I know what I said.

191
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,812
So?

192
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,815
So what?

193
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,319
I'm seven. So?

194
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,950
[soft music playing]

195
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,089
[Pubba] Once upon a time,

196
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,383
bad people ruled the Earth.

197
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,096
Doing what they wanted,
taking from the planet.

198
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
[thunder rumbling]

199
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,724
Just like those ants.

200
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,935
They were greedy things,

201
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,313
self-destructive,

202
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,690
only out for themselves.

203
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,569
So Nature made everyone sick,

204
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,614
and wiped away as many as she could.

205
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,909
And then a miracle happened.

206
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,952
Your kind.

207
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,789
They called them hybrids.

208
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,210
No one knows where you came from or how.

209
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,172
But the people who were left feared you.

210
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,803
They were meaner now, angrier.

211
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,972
They didn't like you
because you were different.

212
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,477
So Nature set
the rest of the Earth on fire.

213
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,815
- And now it burns forever.
- [indistinct disembodied screaming]

214
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,819
But some bad people
are still out there, Gus,

215
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,696
in the flames, waiting.

216
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,034
It's my job
to make sure they never get in.

217
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,247
And it's your job

218
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,915
to live a full life,

219
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,252
and to be happy, to be kind.

220
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,003
I saw her today.

[somber music playing]

222

Who?

223
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,007
Mama.

224
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,554
She was pretty,
but she didn't have nubbins like me.

225
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,598
Yeah, that wasn't your mother, Gus.

226
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,600
How do you know?

227
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,565
'Cause your mother's gone, Gus.

228
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,191
That's how I know.

232
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,519
Happy birthday.

233
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,481
Wow.

234
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,858
What is it?

235
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,569
You'll figure it out.

What did I tell you?

Someone could have seen you!

I heard something!

I told you, she's <i>gone!</i>

257

[sighs] It's my fault.
I told you not to be afraid.

You can!

No, we need to trust each other!

Well, they're not here.

279

You better look someplace else.

How long you been here?

281
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,989
I realize how this looks,
but I give you my word,

282
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,699
I had no idea your camp was here.

283

Who said I had a camp?

285
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,249

- It's not a place for an unarmed woman.
- Don't move.

I want to know if she made it through.

She didn't come through here.

289
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,385
You should get back on the road
before it gets dark.

The road's the last place
you want to be, friend.

You haven't gotten out much lately, huh?

[Pubba] What's it like out there?

293
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,028
It sucks.

[man] It slowed down,

300
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,550
but it's still out there.

301
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,596
- People think the hybrids caused it.
- Yeah, well, maybe<i> it </i>caused them.

302
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,680
[man] Yeah, maybe.

303
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,975
Any case, ain't many of us left.

304
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,146

Are you?

308
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,740
In a company?

00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,702
Alone.

310
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,957

00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,221
Hey!

00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,474
Hey, where'd you go?

318
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,518
Stay back! Stay back!

00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,102
Hey!

320
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,484
He marked us.

321
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,614
- Gus, son, get in.
- I don't wanna.

322
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,408
I said, get in the cubby.

323
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,285
- It's a hole.
- It's not a hole.

324
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,956
You know how foxes hide out during the day
in their little fox house in the ground?

325
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,418
What's the Sick?

326
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,501
It's, uh...

grownup stuff.

328
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,673
Why'd you say you lived alone?

329
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,382
To protect you.

330
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,721
Sometimes it's okay to bend the truth
if it helps someone you love.

331
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,806
Understand?

332
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,308
[Gus] I'm scared.

333
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,935
I know, but I promise you,

334
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,604
if you hide in that cubby
and you be very quiet,

335
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,815
I'll be back before the sun goes to bed.

It's okay to lie?

340
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,454
That's what you took
from that conversation?

341
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,789
No, I said don't come out
until you hear from me.

I love you, Gus.
