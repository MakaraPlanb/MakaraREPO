1
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,394
<i>Mutants...</i>

2
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,522
<i>Born with extraordinary abilities.</i>

3
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,233
<i>And yet, still,</i>

4
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>they are children stumbling in the dark...</i>

5
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,571
<i>Searching for guidance.</i>

6
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,117
<i>A gift can often be a curse.</i>

7
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:20,581
<i>Give someone wings, and they
may fly too close to the sun.</i>

8
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,835
<i>Give them the power of prophecy...</i>

9
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,337
<i>And they may live in fear of the future.</i>

10
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,048
<i>Give them the greatest gifts of all,</i>

11
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,510
<i>powers beyond imagination...</i>

12
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:38,015
<i>And they may think they're
meant to rule the world.</i>

13
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,575
En Sabah Nur.

14
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,745
En Sabah Nur.

15
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,161
<font color="#ffff00">Now you will rule for eternity, my lord.</font>

16
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,925
Ah...

17
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,344
<font color="#ffff00">Sleep.</font>

18
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,267
<font color="#ffff00">Let the transference begin.</font>

19
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,066
<font color="#ffff00">Death to the false god.</font>

20
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,754
<font color="#ffff00">Protect him!</font>

21
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,920
As everyone knows, the existence
of mutants was first discovered

22
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:28,091
during the Paris Peace Accords,
after the Vietnam War in 1973.

23
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,928
Six days later, we all watched
as one of those mutants...

24
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,306
Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the President

25
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,018
and the Cabinet on the lawn
of the White House.

26
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:42,147
Their lives were saved by a young
mutant who stopped him.

27
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:46,359
Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became
the world's most-wanted fugitive.

28
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,111
And as for her, she disappeared as well.

29
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,448
But she has become
the symbol of a new age...

30
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,034
The face of a world that will
never be the same again.

31
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,869
You winking at my girl?

32
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,121
Your girl?

33
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,291
I guess you do look old
enough to be her father.

34
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,460
Excuse me, gentlemen...

35
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,463
Is there something you'd like to be
sharing with the rest of the class?

36
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,298
Can I please go to the bathroom?

37
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,050
I think there's something
seriously wrong with my eyes.

38
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,135
Fine, Scott. And afterwards,

39
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,721
why don't you stop by the principal's
office and explain to him

40
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,181
that you're disrupting class again?

41
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,350
I trust you know the way.

42
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,894
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

43
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,688
No, hang on! Hang on!

44
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,526
Hey!

45
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,945
Now, I know most of you were, what?

46
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,822
Around seven years old at that time?

47
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,793
Summers!

48
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,379
I know you're in here.

49
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,840
What, are you crying?

50
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,134
I haven't even kicked your ass yet.

51
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,639
Summers! You want to eyeball my girl?

52
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,437
Yeah!

53
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,230
<font color="#ffff00">Ten fights waged.</font>

54
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,691
<font color="#ffff00">Ten fights won.</font>

55
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,568
<font color="#ffff00">The Winged Warrior.</font>

56
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,570
<font color="#ffff00">The Bird of Prey.</font>

57
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,070
<font color="#ffff00">The Angel of Death.</font>

58
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,573
<font color="#ffff00">ANGEL!</font>

59
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,782
Yeah!

60
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,291
<font color="#ffff00">Let's hear it for the fat man!</font>

61
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,252
<font color="#ffff00">Our next challenger...</font>

62
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,920
<font color="#ffff00">comes straight...</font>

63
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,257
<font color="#ffff00">from the Munich Circus.</font>

64
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,259
<font color="#ffff00">Ladies and gentlemen,</font>

65
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,262
<font color="#ffff00">the only one that could take on an Angel...</font>

66
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,598
<font color="#ffff00">is the Devil himself.</font>

67
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,851
<font color="#ffff00">I give you...</font>

68
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,187
<font color="#ffff00">the amazing...</font>

69
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,230
<font color="#ffff00">the fantastic...</font>

70
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,400
<font color="#ffff00">NIGHTCRAWLER!</font>

71
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:52,879
<font color="#ffff00">Caution</font>

72
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,505
<font color="#ffff00">High voltage!</font>

73
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,841
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry mutants!</font>

74
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,107
Hey.

75
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,235
<font color="#ffff00">Did you get lost little mouse?</font>

76
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,736
<font color="#ffff00">The fight is over there.</font>

77
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,615
Fight!

78
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,950
Or they'll kill us both!

79
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,829
<font color="#ffff00">And it's about to get exciting.</font>

80
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,165
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, you mean this?</font>

81
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,000
- <i>Ja?</i>
- Mmm.

82
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,729
Nightcrawler!

83
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,820
Nightcrawler! Nightcrawler

84
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,114
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

85
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,156
<font color="#ffff00">They went that way!</font>

86
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,038
You can...

87
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,789
transform.

88
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,166
You're her.

89
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,584
- The hero.
- I'm nobody.

90
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,878
I'm not a hero.
Let's get out of here.

91
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,109
<font color="#ffff00">Have a good night, Henryk.</font>

92
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,445
<font color="#ffff00">You too, Milosz.</font>

93
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,184
<font color="#ffff00">Hi Honey.</font>

94
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,268
<font color="#ffff00">Hi.</font>

95
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,982
Good day?

96
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,275
- Better now.
- Mmm.

97
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,985
Where's Nina?

98
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,405
Out back.
With her friends.

99
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,436
Where did you learn that song, Papa?

100
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,189
I learned it from my parents.

101
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,151
And they learned it from their parents.

102
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,195
And them from theirs.

103
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,489
And one day...

104
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,200
You'll sing it to your children, too.

105
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,162
What happened to them?

106
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,538
Your parents.

107
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,169
They were taken from me...

108
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,171
when I was a little boy.

109
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,050
But they're still here.

110
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,052
Inside.

111
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,848
And here.

112
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,184
With you.

113
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,896
Is someone going to take you away?

114
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,191
Never.

115
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,250
I guess we're more alike
than we thought.

116
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,752
He won't listen to us.

117
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,754
He's just... He's being...

118
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,963
Scott.

119
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,301
Let me try.

120
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,859
<i>Smells pretty old in here.</i>

121
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,903
Is this a school or a museum?

122
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,364
One more.
And last one.

123
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,865
There you go.

124
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,034
- I'll see you guys.
- Oh!

125
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,170
<i>Watch where you're going.</i>

126
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,338
I can't.

127
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,632
Wha... Who are you talking to?

128
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,800
Me.

129
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,220
I just heard you in my head.

130
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,806
I'm telepathic. I read minds.

131
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:37,974
Well, stay out of mine.

132
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,142
I don't need some weird girl
creeping around in there.

133
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,812
Don't worry, Scott.
There's not much to see.

134
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,274
Hey, wait. I didn't tell you my name.

135
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,984
No, you didn't.

136
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,361
Alex Summers?

137
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,446
Hank McCoy!

138
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,324
Whoa! What happened
to the big, blue, furry you?

139
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,285
Uh, I keep him under control now.

140
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,204
This is my brother, Scott.

141
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,832
Hey, Scott. I'm Hank McCoy.
I'm one of the teachers here.

142
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,166
Mmm-hmm.

143
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,919
Where's the professor?

144
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,548
"To break forth bloodily,
then the past must be obliterated

145
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,175
"and a new start made.

146
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,844
"Let us now start fresh

147
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,929
"without remembrance,

148
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,309
"rather than live forward
and backward at the same time."

149
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,770
Now, what on earth do we think
that the author meant...

150
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,314
when he wrote all that?

151
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,235
That's going to be your
assignment for tomorrow.

152
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,571
Top marks, everyone.
Class dismissed.

153
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,698
Alex.

154
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,867
- It's good to see you.
- Ah, you too.

155
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,452
You look well.
It's been a while.

156
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,078
It has.
Not too bad yourself.

157
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,288
Thank you.

158
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,040
This is my brother, Scott.

159
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,252
Hello, Scott. Welcome
to the School for the Gifted.

160
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,755
Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.

161
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,633
It never does, at first.

162
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,721
The first step in understanding one's power

163
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,765
is learning the extent of it.

164
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,976
Only then can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it.

165
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,937
If you do decide to stay,
I can promise you

166
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:11,108
that by the time you're done here,
you'll be able to go back into the world

167
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,985
and play a stable
and productive part in it.

168
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,362
Why don't you take your bandages off

169
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,073
and we can have a look
at what we're dealing with here?

170
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,574
Alex, would you line him up?

171
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,534
Face him in the right direction, as it were.

172
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,161
There's a target just across the water.

173
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,621
When you open your eyes,
try and hit that.

174
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,210
You can open your eyes, Scott.

175
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,088
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's quite...

176
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,887
Look out! Get back!

177
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,430
Get back! Get back!

178
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,730
My grandfather planted that tree
when he was five years old.

179
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,107
I used to swing

180
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,317
from the branches of it, myself.

181
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,031
I think that was probably my favorite tree.

182
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,951
Does that mean I'm expelled?

183
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,369
Oh, on the contrary.

184
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,913
You're enrolled.

185
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,173
<font color="#ffff00">Do you sell rugs?</font>

186
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,508
<font color="#ffff00">You're not allowed in this area.</font>

187
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,385
<font color="#ffff00">This rug is for sale?</font>

188
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,344
<font color="#ffff00">I said, this...</font>

189
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,587
<font color="#ffff00">Earthquake!</font>

190
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,677
Back to bed, please, my darling.
Back to bed.

191
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:54,845
She's doing it again.

192
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,889
Back to bed, please, everyone.

193
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,182
Jesse, back to bed, please.

194
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,850
Come on now.
Spit-spot, back to bed.

195
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,560
Carrie Anne, come on now.
Back to bed.

196
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,904
Never seen it like this.

197
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,280
Nor I.

198
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,241
Don't let any of the children
come this way.

199
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:37,930
Jean.

200
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,452
Jean!

201
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,665
Jean!

202
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,259
I saw the end of the world.

203
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,344
I could feel

204
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,721
all this death.

205
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,392
It was just a dream.

206
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,185
No, it felt real.

207
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,395
I know.

208
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,982
Your mind is the most powerful
I've ever seen.

209
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,441
It can convince itself...

210
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,318
No, no...

211
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,445
It's not just the mind-reading
or the telekinesis...

212
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,114
It's something else.

213
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,328
Some dark power inside and it's growing.

214
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,913
Like a fire.

215
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,499
I thought I was getting better.

216
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,750
You are.

217
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,210
You will.

218
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,045
You just have to be patient.

219
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,632
No, no. You don't know what it's like
to be afraid to shut your eyes.

220
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,260
To be trapped inside your own head.

221
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,179
Oh, I think I do.

222
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,057
It wasn't so long ago that I
was plagued by voices, myself.

223
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,518
All their suffering.

224
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,769
All their pain.

225
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,022
Their secrets.

226
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,486
I'm afraid one day I'm
going to hurt someone.

227
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,116
Lie back.

228
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,755
Everyone fears that which
they do not understand.

229
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,426
You will learn to control your powers.

230
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,428
And when you do...

231
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,972
...you'll have nothing to fear.

232
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,893
Her nightmares were different this time.

233
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,938
It could account for something I saw
when I was in my lab earlier.

234
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,190
There was some kind of tremor.
Like an energy surge.

235
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,983
I picked it up on one of my meters.

236
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,236
You're saying Jean created it?

237
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,904
No. I'm saying something else did.

238
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,697
Maybe she was reacting to it.
I don't know.

239
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,741
But the epicenter was halfway
around the world.

240
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,034
Halfway around the world?

241
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,494
That's why I was hoping
you could take a look.

242
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,955
Let's see what we can find.

243
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,917
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

244
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,680
Okay, the source came from Cairo.

245
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,183
I'll put in the coordinates.

246
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,543
<i>I gotta get out of here.</i>

247
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,378
<i>Give them a report.</i>

248
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,090
What? What is it?

249
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,677
<i>Something happened here.
I can tell them it's real.</i>

250
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,221
It's her.

251
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,514
Who?

252
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,309
- Moira.
- What?

253
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,394
- Moira MacTaggert?
- Mmm-hmm.

254
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,062
Give me the details.

255
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,064
She looks amazing.
She's barely aged a day.

256
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,858
No. I meant...

257
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,484
What is she doing there?

258
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,861
What does the CIA want with this?

259
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,406
She's going back to Langley
to deliver a report.

260
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,241
I'm going to go there...

261
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,744
See if she knows something
about the tremor.

262
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,078
And you want to go see Moira.

263
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,331
I want to go check her out.
Check out...

264
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,623
...the situation.

265
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,667
Hmm.

266
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,420
Moira MacTaggert.

267
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,924
It's like a ghost from the past.

268
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,429
You did a good thing.
You saved that man.

269
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,930
That's not the point.

270
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,849
If I'm exposed, we're all exposed.

271
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,267
We have to go.

272
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,187
This is our home.

273
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,105
This is our daughter's home.

274
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,149
We are her home.

275
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,779
I told you who I was,
the first night I met you.

276
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,947
I trusted you then.

277
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,075
I need you to trust me now.

278
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,286
We can't stay here anymore.

279
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,292
I'll get Nina.

280
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,338
Sweetheart.

281
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,850
She's not in her room.

282
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,477
And I don't see her out back.

283
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,653
Nina?

284
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,029
Nina!

285
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,280
Nina!

286
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,365
Nina!

287
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,497
Nina!

288
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,811
Nina.

289
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,688
<font color="#ffff00">Are you alright?</font>

290
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,273
<font color="#ffff00">She's fine.</font>

291
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,648
<font color="#ffff00">Then let her go!</font>

292
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,817
<font color="#ffff00">We will.</font>

293
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,862
<font color="#ffff00">We just wanted to have a word</font>

294
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,867
<font color="#ffff00">You're not wearing your badges.</font>

295
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,327
<font color="#ffff00">No metal.</font>

296
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,831
<font color="#ffff00">Some guys at the factory said
they saw something today.</font>

297
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,459
<font color="#ffff00">Something that didn't add up.</font>

298
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,127
<font color="#ffff00">Put your weapons away.</font>

299
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,629
<font color="#ffff00">You've been a good citizen, Henryk...</font>

300
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,048
<font color="#ffff00">A good neighbor... a good worker.</font>

301
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,216
<font color="#ffff00">I want to believe that's who you are.</font>

302
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,384
<font color="#ffff00">It is.</font>

303
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,180
<font color="#ffff00">But nobody in this town really knows you.</font>

304
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,764
<font color="#ffff00">Yes you do.</font>

305
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,434
<font color="#ffff00">I am Henryk Gurzsky.</font>

306
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,020
<font color="#ffff00">Jakob, I've had dinner in your home...</font>

307
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,189
<font color="#ffff00">And you were lying the whole time.</font>

308
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,608
<font color="#ffff00">I brought a killer into my house.</font>

309
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,321
<font color="#ffff00">Is this you?</font>

310
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,036
<font color="#ffff00">Are you the one they call Magneto?</font>

311
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,475
<font color="#ffff00">Take me in.</font>

312
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,851
<font color="#ffff00">Please...</font>

313
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,521
<font color="#ffff00">Just let my daughter go.</font>

314
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,823
<font color="#ffff00">Go with your mother.</font>

315
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,416
<font color="#ffff00">Please...!</font>

316
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,336
<font color="#ffff00">Don't leave me.</font>

317
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,422
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not going to let them take you.</font>

318
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,549
Nina.

319
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,677
Nina.

320
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,595
Nina.

321
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,806
<font color="#ffff00">What's going on?</font>

322
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,432
<font color="#ffff00">She's one of them?</font>

323
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,811
<font color="#ffff00">Tell her to stop!</font>

324
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,521
<font color="#ffff00">She can't control it!</font>

325
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:26,940
<font color="#ffff00">She's scared of you!</font>

326
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,150
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not going to let them take you!</font>

327
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,576
<font color="#ffff00">Make her stop!</font>

328
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,829
Nina! Nina!

329
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,337
Ah!

330
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,393
Nina.

331
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,395
Nina, Nina, no...

332
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,647
No, please. Please!

333
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,568
Please.

334
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,486
Please.

335
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,288
Not my babies.

336
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,873
Oh!

337
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,378
Not my babies.

338
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,839
Is this what you want from me?

339
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,219
Is this what I am?

340
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,353
Is this what I am?

341
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,347
<font color="#ffff00">You know what we do to thieves.</font>

342
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,224
<font color="#ffff00">Pick a hand.</font>

343
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,517
<font color="#ffff00">Enough.</font>

344
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,355
<font color="#ffff00">If you're with her,
I suggest you walk away.</font>

345
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:55,982
<font color="#ffff00">While you still can.</font>

346
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,652
<font color="#ffff00">Walk away</font>

347
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:05,033
<font color="#ffff00">Who rules this world?</font>

348
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,327
<font color="#ffff00">What language is that?</font>

349
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,373
<font color="#ffff00">Clown-face. What's the deal?</font>

350
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,583
<font color="#ffff00">Beat it!</font>

351
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,725
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry.</font>

352
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,068
<font color="#ffff00">You can't feel it, can you?</font>

353
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:55,124
<font color="#ffff00">Now you feel it.</font>

354
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,177
So you really haven't seen
her in all these years?

355
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,680
You never looked her up?
Not even in Cerebro?

356
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,975
Alex! What do you take me for,
some kind of pervert?

357
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,977
Yes, I looked her up once. Twice.

358
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,770
But not in a long time, all right?

359
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,106
How did you leave things?
Any hard feelings?

360
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,607
Not likely.

361
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,359
Everybody take a break.

362
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,655
I wiped her mind of all memories of us.

363
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,782
The beach, Cuba...

364
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,617
That whole time.

365
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,119
It was so long ago, Alex.

366
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,871
Before the world knew about mutants.

367
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,999
I felt it was the best thing for her.

368
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,376
And for you?

369
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,881
Didn't really matter what was best for me.

370
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,886
Moira...

371
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,762
MacTaggert, hello!

372
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,977
Allow me to introduce myself.

373
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,896
- I'm Professor...
- Charles Xavier.

374
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,273
- I know exactly who you are.
- You do?

375
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,441
Of course I do.

376
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,652
I have read all of your papers.

377
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,779
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

378
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:08,948
Moira MacTaggert.

379
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,241
- Alex Summers.
- Have a seat.

380
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,076
Just throw that on the floor.

381
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,163
It's wonderful to see you again.

382
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,457
To meet you again, for the first time.

383
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,625
You've got a son?

384
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,128
Yes.

385
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,546
Does he have a husband? Uh...

386
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,091
Do you have a husband?

387
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,218
Uh, I had a husband...

388
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,804
but it's hard to do this job and
make it home in time for dinner.

389
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,847
Good, good.

390
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,390
We all make choices, right?

391
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,893
Yes, we do.

392
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,147
- Professor.
- Yes?

393
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,107
Yes.

394
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,818
I was, we were hoping that you would...

395
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,112
tell us about what happened
yesterday in Egypt.

396
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,907
I'm afraid that's classified information.

397
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,202
I don't mean to be rude...

398
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,329
but how did you get in here?

399
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,706
I have level-five clearance.

400
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,045
Ever since the world found out
about mutants in '73...

401
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,006
there have been cults who see
them as some kind of...

402
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,217
Second Coming or sign of God.

403
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,635
I was tracking one of them.

404
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,889
They call themselves Ashir En Sabah Nur...

405
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:18,184
named after an ancient being
they believe to be the world's first.

406
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,644
The world's first what?

407
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,187
The world's first mutant.

408
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,107
I thought mutants didn't
evolve until this century.

409
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,609
That's the common theory, yes,
but these guys believe...

410
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:30,113
that the first mutant was born
tens of thousands of years ago.

411
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,489
And they believe he will rise again.

412
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,034
They've been searching ancient sites
all around the world for clues.

413
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,578
These hieroglyphs...

414
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,666
describe a specific set of powers
greater than any man could possess.

415
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,334
They think he lived all that time?

416
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,295
Yes and no.
They believe he had the ability...

417
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,964
to transfer his consciousness
from body to body.

418
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,590
And whenever he was close to death...

419
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,134
he would just take on a new body.

420
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,302
Some of these may have been
the bodies of mutants...

421
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,263
enabling him to take their powers...

422
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,265
amassing various abilities over the years.

423
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:00,059
- An all-powerful mutant.
- Exactly.

424
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,021
And wherever this being
was he always had four...

425
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,024
principle followers. Disciples.

426
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,109
Protectors he would imbue with powers.

427
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,360
Like the Four Horsemen...

428
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,779
of the Apocalypse.

429
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,489
He got that one from the Bible.

430
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,450
Or the Bible got it from him.

431
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,702
And wherever he ruled...

432
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,788
eventually, it would end in disaster.

433
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,206
Cataclysm.

434
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,417
Some kind of...

435
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,044
Apocalypse.

436
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,838
The end of the world.

437
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,467
<i>I must say, Apollo...</i>

438
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,635
<i>the way you ape</i>

439
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,928
<i>human behavior is remarkable.</i>

440
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,644
<i>I am Apollo.</i>

441
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,773
<font color="#ffff00">I've never seen another
mutant in this town.</font>

442
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,524
<font color="#ffff00">You speak Egyptian?</font>

443
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,400
<font color="#ffff00">Arabic?</font>

444
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,069
English?

445
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,779
<i>I'm a scientist.</i>

446
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,280
<i>My particular specialty...</i>

447
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:55,448
Great fighter.

448
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,701
She's my hero.

449
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,745
I want to be like her.

450
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,334
There's some food here. Not much.

451
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,543
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

452
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,087
<i>You love me.</i>

453
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:10,963
<i>Love you?</i>

454
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:12,799
<i>Illogical.</i>

455
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,636
<i>I'm not some simple
shepherdess you can awe.</i>

456
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,264
<i>Why, I could no more love you...</i>

457
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,392
<i>than I could love a new
species of bacteria.</i>

458
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,062
What are you doing?

459
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,149
Learning.

460
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,700
<i>In the streets, there is outrage</i>

461
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,369
<i>against the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan...</i>

462
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:42,912
<i>...in a brotherhood of our kind.</i>

463
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:43,996
<i>Several demonstrations.</i>

464
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,208
<i>One of them was held in Boston,</i>

465
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,584
<i>and Bruce Morton has the story.</i>

466
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,586
<i>Since the advent of nuclear weapons,</i>

467
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,630
<i>the United States does not start fights.</i>

468
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,507
Weapons.

469
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,426
<i>Never before has man
possessed so much power.</i>

470
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,012
<i>Soviet Union and United States
being superpowers...</i>

471
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,600
Superpowers.

472
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,228
The weak...

473
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,564
have taken the earth.

474
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,234
For this, I was betrayed.

475
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,945
False gods.

476
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:17,864
Idols.

477
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,410
No more.

478
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:29,208
I have returned.

479
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,003
<i>A new tomorrow...</i>

480
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,713
<i>that starts today.</i>

481
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,428
Where did you come from?

482
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,765
Oh...

483
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,563
A time before man lost his way.

484
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,568
Welcome to the '80s.

485
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,571
This world needs to be...

486
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,200
<font color="#ffff00">Cleansed.</font>

487
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:03,743
What?

488
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,204
Saved.

489
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,249
You can't save the world...

490
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,376
just going around killing people.

491
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,212
There's laws, systems in place...

492
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,504
for that kind of thing.

493
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,634
My child...

494
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,428
why do you enslave yourself?

495
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,851
What are you doing?

496
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,603
Making you stronger.

497
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,898
My goddess.

498
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,739
<i>Aphrodite.</i>

499
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,075
<i>You were right.</i>

500
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,368
Yes.

501
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,539
<i>You were right.</i>

502
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,084
<i>The time is past.</i>

503
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,337
<i>There is no room for gods.</i>

504
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,176
Why can't I go with you?

505
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,970
I told you, I work alone.

506
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,353
Wait there.

507
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,815
Always good to see your face.

508
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,024
Even if it's not yours.

509
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,402
Papers and passage for one.

510
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:21,696
Uh-huh.

511
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,115
Where's the gentleman going,
if I may ask?

512
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,408
Don't know, don't care.

513
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,160
I just save his life.
What he does with it is up to him.

514
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,247
Mystique, the mercenary.

515
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,665
Don't call me that.

516
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,166
No matter how much you pretend
to be someone else...

517
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,793
Caliban knows who you are.

518
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,129
If there's anything worth
knowing about mutants...

519
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,797
Caliban knows it.

520
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:41,340
Mystique.

521
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,050
Why don't you ask your psychics...

522
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,177
what'll happen to you
if you keep pushing me?

523
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,262
What'll happen?

524
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,435
Psylocke gets a little jealous.

525
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,855
But Caliban likes you.

526
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,273
Caliban likes money.

527
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,317
Caliban likes you so much...

528
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,652
he wants to give you free information...

529
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,779
about an old friend...

530
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,406
from back when you had friends.

531
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,409
Do you remember...

532
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,619
Erik Lehnsherr?

533
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,913
My girls got a flash of him in Poland.

534
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,041
He left quite a few dead
bodies in his wake...

535
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,085
including his wife and daughter.

536
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,255
Should be in the news soon enough...

537
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,382
but Caliban gives you a little head start.

538
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,219
- How fast are you?
- How fast?

539
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,929
How far can you cover?

540
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,765
Uh, as far as I can see
or if I've been there before.

541
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,266
Come with me, Crawler.

542
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,893
Actually, it's Nightcrawler.

543
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,978
And my real name is...

544
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,148
Kurt Wagner.

545
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,905
The lenses are made of some
ruby quartz I had lying around.

546
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,823
They should be able to refract
your optic beams...

547
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,700
and keep them contained
within their own vector fields.

548
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,410
Try them on.

549
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,801
Okay.

550
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,886
Go ahead.

551
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,764
Wait, sorry, no.

552
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,890
Okay.

553
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,974
- Now?
- Yeah, you're good.

554
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,059
All right.

555
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,147
Whoa. I...

556
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,150
I can see.

557
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,527
Thank you.

558
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,821
Professor, thank you.
You're a genius.

559
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:27,947
No.

560
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,825
I'm not a professor. I wish...

561
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,619
Who's that?

562
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,124
I believe you two met.
That's Jean Grey.

563
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,542
You bumped into her when you arrived.

564
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,669
- Wait, that's her?
- Yeah.

565
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:47,842
Hey.

566
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,054
You can see.

567
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,808
Yeah. It's not as bad as I thought here.

568
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:56,976
Freak.

569
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,436
Someone should warn the new kid.

570
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,895
They're still scared of me.

571
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,148
Hey, I have special glasses now.

572
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,607
They're not scared of you.

573
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,484
They're scared of me.

574
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,405
You're not the only one who can't
fully control your powers.

575
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,407
Wait, so...

576
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,368
last night, when the house shook...

577
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,828
that was you?

578
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:18,497
Sorry to break it to you, but you're not
the biggest freak in the school.

579
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,417
Well, that's a first.

580
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,640
Raven.

581
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,104
Wow. Um...

582
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,232
I... You're...

583
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,525
Not blue?

584
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,611
Looks like you and I have
that in common, now.

585
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,863
No, no, I meant, um...

586
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,991
you're back.

587
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,536
Never thought I'd see you here again.

588
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,289
Yeah, me neither.

589
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,002
I'm blue.

590
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,629
I'm Kurt.

591
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,088
Oh, right.

592
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,381
Kurt Wagner.

593
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,217
Welcome.

594
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,138
We're closed.

595
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,685
I knew I felt a chill in the air.

596
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,731
How did you get in here?

597
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:26,941
We let ourselves in.

598
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,609
We are looking for mutants.

599
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,820
Since you know where to find
them, we came here.

600
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,364
Caliban doesn't know you.

601
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,201
We're looking for the strongest.

602
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,873
Everything all right?

603
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,291
I'm fine, Psylocke.

604
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,794
How much money do you have?

605
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,128
None.

606
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,423
Like Caliban said...

607
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,300
we are closed. Yeah?

608
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,263
I need your help, my child.

609
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,890
You don't look like Caliban's father.

610
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,309
Maybe a little bit up here.

611
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,236
You are all my children...

612
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,739
and you're lost, because
you follow blind leaders.

613
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,909
These false gods...

614
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,829
systems of the weak.

615
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,498
They've ruined my world...

616
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:25,916
No more.

617
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,468
What do you want?

618
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:47,855
I want you...

619
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,275
to feel the full reach of your power.

620
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:00,409
You've only had a taste
of your true strength.

621
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:01,827
Unlike others...

622
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,371
who seek to control you...

623
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,207
I want to set you free.

624
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,303
I know the kind of mutants
you're looking for.

625
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,891
And I know where to find them.

626
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,104
<i>It's my first time in America.</i>

627
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,148
I'm very excited to see your culture.

628
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,983
Well, you're not gonna see it here.

629
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,903
The only thing American about this
place is that it used to be British.

630
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,571
This is Scott.

631
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,074
He's new here, too.

632
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,700
And I'm already up for a prison break.

633
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,455
What do we say, we take this
blue guy on a little field trip?

634
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,457
I'm sure there's a mall
around here, somewhere.

635
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,209
What's a mall?

636
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,419
What's a mall?

637
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,381
All right, now this is a matter
of national pride. Civic duty.

638
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,632
Scott.

639
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,718
What? You've been cooped up
here for a long time...

640
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,221
and the Professor's not even home.

641
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,390
I'd like to go to the mall.

642
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:07,935
Try it.

643
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,103
All right.

644
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,230
Where does he keep his cars?

645
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,205
Or should I say "piss off"?

646
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,795
This is the guy?

647
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,463
He used to be.

648
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,674
I didn't know his wings were...

649
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:43,929
Let's get out of here.

650
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,514
His fighting days are done.

651
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,016
No, they're not.

652
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,940
What the hell is this?

653
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,778
I want to give you something.

654
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,489
There's nothing you can
give me that I want.

655
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,284
Yes, there is.

656
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,092
Yes, my son.

657
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,191
Yes.

658
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,830
Rise, my angel.

659
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,834
Rise.

660
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,740
Wow.

661
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,370
Hypersonic, blast resistant,

662
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,704
stealth technology.

663
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,164
That's impressive.

664
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,000
How are you ever gonna get it out of here?

665
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:39,419
Well, that's okay.

666
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,421
I built a retractable roof
into the basketball court.

667
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,092
Hank, you're building a warplane down here.

668
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,302
After what happened in Washington,

669
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:48,595
I thought we were going to come back...

670
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,848
and start the X-Men,
like we all used to talk about.

671
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,266
But...

672
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,434
Charles wants students, not soldiers.

673
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,436
And he thinks the best of people.

674
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,688
He has hope.

675
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,231
And you?

676
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,526
You know, I think we should
hope for the best.

677
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,112
And prepare for the worst.

678
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,447
I think the world needs the X-Men.

679
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,369
And maybe now that you're back,
you could help me convince him.

680
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,537
We could start it together.

681
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:14,955
Hank, I'm here about Erik.

682
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,208
Right. Erik.

683
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,626
Yeah. Of course.

684
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,295
Of course.

685
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,754
I think he might be
in some kind of trouble.

686
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,798
Real trouble.

687
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,885
Well, isn't he always?

688
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,921
Some of you spoke to the police

689
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:08,216
about what you believe you
witnessed here yesterday.

690
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,596
You want to know my powers?

691
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:15,849
Know who I am?

692
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,436
See what I can do?

693
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,190
I'll show you.

694
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,862
Think of the person you
love most in your life.

695
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,449
Your wife.

696
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,536
Mother.

697
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,124
Daughter.

698
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:49,091
Now that person will know what
it is to lose someone they love.

699
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,636
And live with that pain.

700
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,138
Forever.

701
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,723
<font color="#ffff00">Henryk, please.</font>

702
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,058
<font color="#ffff00">Don't do this.</font>

703
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,061
My name isn't Henryk.

704
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:07,734
My name is Magneto.

705
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,756
Who the fuck are you?

706
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,261
Stay back.

707
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,097
Whoever you are...

708
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,350
don't try to stop me
from killing these men.

709
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,621
I'm not here for them.

710
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,125
I'm here for you.

711
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,061
Come and see.

712
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,013
This is where your power was born.

713
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,935
And this is where your
people were slaughtered.

714
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,702
You shouldn't have brought me here.

715
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,206
Why?

716
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,710
Are you afraid to be here?

717
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,090
You can't escape it, Erik.

718
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,885
Who are you?

719
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,222
Elohim, Shen, Ra.

720
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:46,268
I've been called many names
over many lifetimes.

721
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,896
I am born of death.

722
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,773
I was there to spark

723
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,901
and fan the flame of man's awakening.

724
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,487
To spin the wheel of civilization.

725
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,239
And when the forest would grow rank...

726
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,575
and needed clearing for new growth...

727
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,954
I was there to set it ablaze.

728
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:08,915
Where were you

729
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,501
when my father and mother were
slaughtered in this place?

730
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,669
Asleep.

731
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:15,463
Trapped in darkness.

732
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:17,924
I was not there for you, my son.

733
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,343
But I am here now.

734
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,181
You don't know your own strength, but I do.

735
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,019
Reach down.

736
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,937
Feel the metal...

737
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,939
in the ground.

738
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:36,109
Reach as deep as you can.

739
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,323
You'll find you have the power

740
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:44,367
to move the very Earth itself.

741
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,551
Oh.

742
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,529
Everything they've built will fall!

743
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,409
And from the ashes of their world...

744
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,248
...we'll build a better one!

745
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,611
Lehnsherr was identified yesterday,
in this small town in central Poland.

746
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:06,116
<i>Leaders from all communities are urging
their citizens to remain calm.</i>

747
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:09,536
<i>As police and armed forces
are mobilizing to find Lehnsherr...</i>

748
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:11,037
<i>...before he can strike again.</i>

749
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:14,291
<i>If anyone has information
about Lehnsherr...</i>

750
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,418
<i>or as he is also known, Magneto...</i>

751
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,087
<i>contact your local authorities immediately...</i>

752
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,214
<i>and proceed with caution...</i>

753
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,758
- <i>as he is considered extremely...</i>
- Peter.

754
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,427
What's up?

755
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,098
Just checking on you.

756
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:31,891
I'm good. Playing Pac-Man.

757
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,232
You sure you weren't watching this?

758
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,234
<i>This news comes at a time
when the world is celebrating</i>

759
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:43,486
<i>10 years of peace between
mutants and mankind.</i>

760
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,405
You're going after him, aren't you?

761
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:49,242
You wanted me to get out
of the house more, right?

762
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,746
I can't stop you.
Nobody can.

763
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,914
But trust me, this won't end well.

764
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,667
Nothing does with him.

765
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,922
I'm not afraid of him.

766
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,175
You should be.

767
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,535
I've read so much about this place.

768
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,956
But being here,
it actually seems kind of...

769
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,167
familiar.

770
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:40,335
Strange.

771
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,628
Quite.

772
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,421
- Shall we?
- Huh.

773
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,633
I'm just saying, <i>Empire</i> is still the best.

774
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,344
It's the most complex,
the most sophisticated,

775
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:50,845
wasn't afraid to have a dark ending.

776
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,514
Yeah, but come on.
If it wasn't for the first one,

777
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,182
you wouldn't have any
of the rest of the movies.

778
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:57,852
Well, at least we can all agree,
the third one's always the worst.

779
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,313
Hank. Are you in here?

780
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,023
I'd like you to meet...

781
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,193
Moira.

782
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,861
Raven.

783
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,696
I'm sorry, have we met?

784
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,573
Uh...

785
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:13,243
Hank, Alex, Agent MacTaggert...

786
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,661
would you give us just one moment, please?

787
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,038
Of course.

788
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,545
Charles, why didn't she recognize me?
She knew me in this form.

789
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,423
Well, after you left me
on the beach in Cuba...

790
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,259
I took her memories of that time.
Have a seat.

791
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,845
Lucky girl.

792
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:36,516
It's good to see you, Raven.

793
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,935
- Welcome home.
- This isn't my home.

794
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,563
It was once.

795
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,565
No, it was your home.
I just lived here.

796
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,067
And I barely even recognize it now.

797
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:48,027
You know, I have plans for this place.

798
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,030
I mean to turn it into a real campus.

799
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,240
A university.

800
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,243
Not just for mutants,
either, for humans too.

801
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,787
Living and working...

802
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,540
growing together.

803
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,709
You know, I really believed that once.

804
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:05,628
I really believed we could
change them after DC.

805
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,213
We did.

806
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,299
No, Charles. They still hate and fear us.

807
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,718
It's just harder to see because
they're more polite about it.

808
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,136
I got sick of living that lie.

809
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,389
That's why you're not
in your natural blue form.

810
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:19,559
I'm not gonna be the face
of a world that doesn't exist.

811
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,353
Things are better.
The world is better.

812
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,063
Maybe in Westchester.

813
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,858
Out there, mutants are still running...

814
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,152
hiding, living in fear.

815
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,113
Just because there's not a war,
doesn't mean there's peace.

816
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,491
You want to teach your kids
something, teach them that.

817
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,201
Teach them to fight.

818
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,328
Otherwise they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives.

819
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,663
You still sound just like him.

820
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,499
You sound just like Erik.

821
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,211
That's why I'm here.

822
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,505
He's resurfaced.

823
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,967
He had a wife and a child.

824
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,344
They were killed.

825
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,180
Along with a handful of policemen.

826
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,393
The whole world will be looking for him.

827
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,104
But you can help me find
him before they do.

828
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,616
Moira, I'm going to have to ask
you to keep this a secret.

829
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,827
I don't even know what this is.

830
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,454
It's Cerebro.

831
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:22,622
The new model.

832
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,457
I based the color on...

833
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,752
It doesn't matter.

834
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,230
What are those?

835
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,566
Those are all the humans of the world.

836
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,736
And these...

837
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,281
are all the mutants.

838
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,949
I'm connected to all of their minds.

839
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,911
The CIA would kill for this.

840
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,705
I know they would.

841
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,376
Where are you, Erik?

842
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:41,326
Charles?

843
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:43,870
Hello, old friend.

844
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:49,000
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

845
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,835
I feel your pain.

846
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,130
And your loss.

847
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,134
You think because you
can see into my head...

848
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,887
you know how it feels?

849
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:04,015
<i>You're looking in the wrong place, Charles.</i>

850
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,851
What happened to them,
it was terribly wrong.

851
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,021
But come back to us.

852
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,731
<i>I can help you.</i>

853
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,275
Help me?

854
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,569
Think of your wife,
think of your daughter.

855
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,363
<i>What would they have wanted?</i>

856
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,156
They would have wanted to live.

857
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,284
<i>I tried your way, Charles.</i>

858
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,829
<i>I tried to be like them.</i>

859
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,582
Live like them.

860
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,212
But it always ends the same way.

861
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:38,549
They took everything away from me.

862
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,680
Now...

863
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,310
we'll take everything from them.

864
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:58,945
Hank...

865
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,241
he's not alone.

866
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,166
Extraordinary.

867
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,378
What do you see?

868
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:19,882
The answer.

869
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,720
Hey, Charles, wait.

870
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:38,484
Oh, my God.

871
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:42,238
Thank you for letting me in.

872
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:48,911
Charles, get out!

873
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,916
I've never felt power like this before.

874
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,210
Charles... Charles, get out of there.

875
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,004
What's going on?
What's happening?

876
01:10:58,171 --> 01:10:59,172
I think...

877
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,132
Someone's taken over Cerebro.

878
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:03,217
- They've taken control of it.
- To do what?

879
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,304
To connect.

880
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,398
Always the same.

881
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:21,527
<i>And now, all this.</i>

882
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,116
<i>No more stones.</i>

883
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,580
<i>No more spears.</i>

884
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,714
<i>No more slings.</i>

885
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,722
<i>No more swords.</i>

886
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,725
No more weapons!

887
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:56,354
<i>No more systems!</i>

888
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:59,732
<i>No more!</i>

889
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,194
No more superpowers.

890
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:05,780
<i>Charles!</i>

891
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,076
Hank!

892
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,345
What the hell is going on?

893
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,806
Who's turning the keys?

894
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:33,766
The men are.

895
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,685
Who green-lit the launch?

896
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,937
Hank, do something!

897
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:43,818
It won't shut down!

898
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:49,198
We've lost contact with all
Trident and Polaris subs.

899
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,534
The Air Force is reporting the same thing.

900
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,996
So much faith in their tools...

901
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,832
and their machines.

902
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,333
<i>Russia, China...</i>

903
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,211
England, Israel, India.

904
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,255
Everybody's got nukes in the air.

905
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:05,423
What's the target?

906
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,674
Where are they going?

907
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,718
Up, straight up.

908
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:09,927
- Alex...
- What?

909
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,053
Destroy it!

910
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,180
Destroy everything.
Destroy Cerebro!

911
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,186
Wreak havoc!

912
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,485
You can fire your arrows...

913
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,155
<i>from the Tower of Babel...</i>

914
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:42,335
...but you can never strike God!

915
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,063
Charles, are you okay?

916
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,082
Erik.

917
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:25,628
Charles!

918
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,130
Alex!

919
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,758
Hey! Hey, asshole!

920
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:33,094
All will be revealed, my child.

921
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,470
Stop!

922
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,554
No!

923
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:40,476
Ah.

924
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,325
Huh?

925
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,081
Huh?

926
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:32,731
Wow!

927
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:39,530
Where did you...

928
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:42,324
I was looking for the Professor.
I thought he lived here.

929
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:46,871
They took him.

930
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,915
She's the one. It's her.

931
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,042
Are you sure?

932
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:54,253
Is she gonna help us?

933
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,135
Wow.

934
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:05,389
They look up to you.

935
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,352
Right now...

936
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,438
...they need you.

937
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,902
That's not what they need.

938
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,322
Whoa. That's awesome!

939
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,623
What happened?

940
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:31,832
Where's Alex?

941
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:33,083
Where's my brother?

942
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,377
Pretty sure I got everybody.

943
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,591
Alex was closest to the blast.

944
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:57,608
Alex...

945
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:20,839
<i>We're one click out.</i>

946
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,550
<i>All right, boys. This is it.</i>

947
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:26,929
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

948
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,013
Scott.

949
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:31,642
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

950
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,895
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

951
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:38,148
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

952
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:41,151
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

953
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:44,530
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

954
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:47,032
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

955
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:49,827
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

956
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,915
Hey! Moira MacTaggert!

957
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:56,709
CIA! Thank God you're here!

958
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,674
Wait!

959
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:06,051
Fire!

960
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,391
I want her.

961
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:15,519
Him.

962
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,314
Him.

963
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:27,698
- And her.
- Yes, sir.

964
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,661
Leave the kids.

965
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:41,295
- What do we do?
- Keep quiet.

966
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,174
X-Ray 7, I'm doing a final
sweep of the ground.

967
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,809
Let's get them on the bird!

968
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:56,977
Clear!

969
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:05,944
Thanks, Jean.
We gotta help them.

970
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,238
- Kurt, can you get us in that thing?
- You want to get in there?

971
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,990
What if the soldiers see us?

972
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:11,825
Don't worry, they won't see us.
Trust me.

973
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,037
Hold on.

974
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,305
Kurt, get us all out of here!

975
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,308
Uh, I can't!

976
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:39,978
When they closed the doors,
there's some kind of electrical field.

977
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,355
It's like Berlin all over.

978
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,065
Jean, get in the pilots' heads.
Don't let them take off.

979
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:46,402
I can't. I can't reach the pilots.
I can't reach anyone.

980
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:56,328
<i>We're also getting reports
out of Europe and Asia.</i>

981
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,664
<i>This was not just a U.S. phenomenon.</i>

982
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:02,960
<i>It seems the entire world has been
disarmed of nuclear weapons.</i>

983
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:04,503
<i>The Pentagon has confirmed
multiple launches</i>

984
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,964
<i>from Russia, as well as the UK,
Israel and China.</i>

985
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,507
- Look!
- Look up there!

986
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:11,176
<i>So far, there has been no
response from the White House.</i>

987
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,469
<i>Eyewitness reports have been pouring in</i>

988
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,346
<i>from affiliates across the globe.</i>

989
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:18,350
<i>Authorities are not sure if it was
an act of peace or an act of war.</i>

990
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,025
Our dear Father...

991
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,570
hold me in the light of God.

992
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:36,201
It should have been me.

993
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:40,789
He was the one that was gonna
do something with his life.

994
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,541
He was always the one.

995
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:45,961
That's not how he felt.

996
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,507
He felt you were the one that was gonna
do something special with your life.

997
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,761
That you were gonna make
a difference in the world.

998
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:58,140
Maybe even change it.

999
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,851
How do you know what he felt?

1000
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:04,188
I know what everybody feels.

1001
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,247
Hold me in the light of God.

1002
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,501
Protect me from danger.

1003
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:28,670
<i>Save me by Your command.</i>

1004
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,882
<i>Listen to my prayer.</i>

1005
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,801
<i>And keep me safe.</i>

1006
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,339
You're blocking me.

1007
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:13,507
How?

1008
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,968
I can shield their minds from your power.

1009
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:19,596
It's one of the many gifts I've acquired
throughout the millennia.

1010
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:22,391
But to see

1011
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,101
inside a mind...

1012
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:26,478
To control it...

1013
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,273
That's your gift.

1014
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,985
You saw it, didn't you?

1015
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,237
The glory of what's to come.

1016
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:37,489
You're going to take part
in all this killing...

1017
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,493
and destruction?

1018
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,287
It's all I've ever known.

1019
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,122
No, it isn't.

1020
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,623
You've just forgotten.

1021
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,709
No, Charles, I remember.

1022
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,588
Your way doesn't work.

1023
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:55,757
I've shown him a better way.

1024
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,217
A better world.

1025
01:24:57,384 --> 01:25:00,470
No, you've just tapped into his rage and pain.
That's all you've done.

1026
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:04,349
I told you from the moment I met you,
there is more to you, Erik.

1027
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:07,144
There is good in you, too.

1028
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:10,105
Whatever it is you think
you saw in me, Charles...

1029
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,109
I buried it...

1030
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:17,070
with my family.

1031
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,541
What?

1032
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,585
What's wrong with you?

1033
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:33,670
Is that going to happen to all of us?

1034
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:35,589
No, I just...

1035
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:37,007
left my meds in the house.

1036
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:39,092
What happened?
Where are we?

1037
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:40,260
Hey!

1038
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:41,803
<i>Hello, Mystique.</i>

1039
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,388
<i>Major Stryker.</i>

1040
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:44,556
Colonel Stryker.

1041
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,767
I wouldn't get too close
to the wall, if I were you.

1042
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:49,019
<i>It may create some discomfort.</i>

1043
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:51,772
I'm Moira MacTaggert.
I'm a senior officer at the CIA.

1044
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:54,066
<i>I know who you are, Agent MacTaggert.</i>

1045
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,942
You cannot keep me here, in this...

1046
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:57,319
Actually, I can.

1047
01:25:57,486 --> 01:26:01,406
<i>A psychic event just destroyed
every nuke from here to Moscow.</i>

1048
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:05,285
<i>That event emanated from
exactly where we found you.</i>

1049
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:07,913
<i>At the home of the world's
most powerful psychic.</i>

1050
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,999
So, you are going to tell me,
where is Charles Xavier?

1051
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,169
It's not him you should be worried about.

1052
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,422
There's someone else.
Someone more powerful.

1053
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:21,176
<i>If you let us out of here,
we can help you.</i>

1054
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,846
Do you really expect me to believe that?

1055
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:28,058
<i>You can put on any face that you want,
but I know who you are.</i>

1056
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:29,601
<i>What you are.</i>

1057
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,650
Hey, Moira, um...

1058
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,568
What did you mean when you said

1059
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:40,612
someone more powerful than Charles?

1060
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,533
Once they finish these,
we'll go from there.

1061
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,708
What's taking so long?

1062
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,000
I can't get in.

1063
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,837
They have a field around it,
like the helicopter.

1064
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,089
There's gotta be a way to cut the power.

1065
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:00,257
<i>Charles...</i>

1066
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,718
...you will send a message

1067
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,553
to every living mind.

1068
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,473
You will tell them that this
earth will be laid waste.

1069
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,392
That it is I, En Sabah Nur,

1070
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,269
who will wreak this upon them.

1071
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,569
Now...

1072
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:23,739
deliver my message.

1073
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,699
Even if I wanted to...

1074
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:28,368
I couldn't reach that many people.
I don't have Cerebro.

1075
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,373
You don't need a machine

1076
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,959
to amplify your powers.

1077
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:38,879
You have me.

1078
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,561
Guys, that could be our way out of here.

1079
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,776
You know him?
Magneto?

1080
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,695
I used to.

1081
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:05,906
Not so sure anymore.

1082
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,116
What was he like?

1083
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,286
Was he, uh... Like they say he was?
Was he...

1084
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,164
the bad guy?

1085
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:15,415
No.

1086
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,503
I mean, yeah. He was...

1087
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:24,341
Why do you care so much?
You see his speech on TV or something?

1088
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,177
Yeah, but, uh...

1089
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:32,849
He's my father.

1090
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:34,142
What?

1091
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:36,102
- Him and my mom, they did it.
- No, I know...

1092
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:37,854
Are you sure?

1093
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:40,899
Yeah. He left my mom before I was born.

1094
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:42,484
I met him 10 years back

1095
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:44,110
but I didn't know it was him.

1096
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:46,905
By the time I figured it out,
it was too late.

1097
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:49,407
Then, this week I saw him on TV again,

1098
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:52,077
and I came to that house,
looking for him...

1099
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:54,454
But by the time I got there...

1100
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,041
Late again.

1101
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,379
For a guy who moves as fast as me,

1102
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,756
I always seem to be too late.

1103
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:07,592
Let's hope not this time.

1104
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:09,594
Yeah.

1105
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:10,720
Seriously.

1106
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,682
<i>Hear me inhabitants of this world.</i>

1107
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,685
- What is that?
- <i>This is a message.</i>

1108
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:18,395
I think it's the Professor.

1109
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:22,399
<i>A message to every man, woman,
and mutant in the world.</i>

1110
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:25,402
You have lost your way.

1111
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,363
You have lost your way.

1112
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,948
But I have returned.

1113
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:33,660
But I have returned.

1114
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:37,122
<i>The day of reckoning is here.</i>

1115
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,375
<i>All your buildings...</i>

1116
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,588
<font color="#ffff00">...all of your towers and temples...</font>

1117
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,631
<font color="#ffff00">Will fall.</font>

1118
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:52,470
<font color="#ffff00">And the dawn of a new age will rise.</font>

1119
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:54,055
<i>...for there is nothing you can do...</i>

1120
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:56,474
- <i>Jean.</i>
- <i>...to stop what is coming.</i>

1121
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:01,187
<i>Jean, if you can hear me,
focus on my voice.</i>

1122
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,732
<i>Cairo. Find us, Jean.</i>

1123
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:05,317
<i>Find us. Cairo. Find us.</i>

1124
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:09,237
<i>This message is for one reason alone.</i>

1125
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,656
To tell the strongest among you...

1126
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:15,744
Those with the greatest power...

1127
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:19,331
This earth will be yours.

1128
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,334
Those with the greatest power...

1129
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:27,005
Protect those without.

1130
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:32,928
That's my message to the world.

1131
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:35,680
Uh-huh.

1132
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:39,184
How was Charles doing that without Cerebro?

1133
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:41,853
Sir, what was that voice?

1134
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:44,022
<i>I know that voice.</i>

1135
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:45,732
<i>It's Xavier, isn't it?
What's going on?</i>

1136
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,609
- We don't know!
- We don't know, bro!

1137
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:49,611
He just spoke to me.

1138
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,863
I think he spoke to everyone.

1139
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,448
- I could hear him, too.
- No, no...

1140
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:55,283
He just sent me a hidden message.

1141
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:56,952
One he knew only I would hear.

1142
01:30:57,869 --> 01:30:58,870
I know where they are.

1143
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:00,622
Hey!

1144
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,125
<i>We have shots fired!
Where's it coming from?</i>

1145
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,128
I have intruders in Quad Six.

1146
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:11,216
Send a security team.
Take them out.

1147
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:21,226
The generator.
It's worth a shot.

1148
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,228
Kurt?

1149
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:47,252
There's some kind of animal in there.

1150
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:52,841
It's no animal.

1151
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:54,592
It's a man.

1152
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:56,428
Who is he?

1153
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:00,098
That part of him as been taken away.

1154
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:02,517
What do you mean?

1155
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:06,104
I mean they turned him
into some kind of weapon.

1156
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:13,945
<i>Charlie Three, report.
Did you find them?</i>

1157
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:26,624
Shut it down.

1158
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:51,566
Fire!

1159
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,745
Weapon X is loose!

1160
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:06,706
I repeat, Weapon X is loose!

1161
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,668
You sure he's not an animal?

1162
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:18,676
- He's into the central halls.
- <i>Engaging target Sector Five.</i>

1163
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:20,386
<i>We can't...</i>

1164
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:37,695
Hey!

1165
01:33:58,383 --> 01:33:59,926
- What are they doing?
- What's going on?

1166
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:02,428
- <i>I just lost feed.</i>
- <i>Hey! What's going on here?</i>

1167
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:05,640
I'll be right back.

1168
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:09,727
No!

1169
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:29,247
Hey! Stay where you are!

1170
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,601
Scott, wait.

1171
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:53,605
<i>I can help you.</i>

1172
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:00,820
Jean.

1173
01:35:39,484 --> 01:35:41,402
<i>Logan.</i>

1174
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,868
What'd you do to him?

1175
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:35,790
I found a piece of his past
and gave it back to him.

1176
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:38,543
Just the few memories I could reach.

1177
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,755
I hope that's the last
we've seen of that guy.

1178
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:55,310
Oh...

1179
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:03,192
Kurt.

1180
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:07,322
- What?
- What?

1181
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:08,489
Hey.

1182
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:15,872
<i>Stay away from the...</i>

1183
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:17,040
The what?

1184
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:18,583
<i>The do-...</i>

1185
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:19,876
<i>Stay away from the...</i>

1186
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,169
Get away from the door!

1187
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,337
<i>On three.</i>

1188
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,714
<i>One... Two...</i>

1189
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:39,270
We know where the Professor is.

1190
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:40,772
I think we might have a way out of here.

1191
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:43,816
- Well, you've been busy.
- We had a little help.

1192
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:45,902
Let's go!

1193
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:50,156
Ah! Jesus!

1194
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:51,324
Oh, sorry!

1195
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:52,658
This way!

1196
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:04,629
This was meant to be
the center of the universe

1197
01:38:04,796 --> 01:38:06,506
before I was betrayed.

1198
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:08,257
Now...

1199
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:09,759
it will be.

1200
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:31,632
Nice.

1201
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:35,136
Hey, Hank, do you think
you can fly this thing?

1202
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:37,430
Yeah, I can figure it out.

1203
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:39,640
Hey, guys.

1204
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,643
Flight suits.

1205
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:48,483
You got your warplane.

1206
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:50,067
Let's go to war.

1207
01:39:57,283 --> 01:39:59,035
A gift...

1208
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:01,120
from the past you left behind...

1209
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:05,041
and the future that lies ahead.

1210
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:09,962
You will reach down, my son.

1211
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,256
Deep into the earth.

1212
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:15,676
Rip everything they've built
from the ground.

1213
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:18,429
Wipe clean this world.

1214
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:22,141
And we will lead those that survive...

1215
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:25,102
into a better one.

1216
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,063
And me?

1217
01:40:28,231 --> 01:40:30,816
Am I to play a role in this madness?

1218
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:36,155
You have the most important role of all.

1219
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,168
Were you scared?

1220
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:51,629
That day in D.C., were you scared?

1221
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:52,797
No.

1222
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:01,681
But I was scared on my first mission.

1223
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,100
I was on a plane like this with my friends.

1224
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:05,851
About your age.

1225
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,732
We called ourselves the X-Men.

1226
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:14,694
Your brother was there.

1227
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:16,612
We used to call him Havok.

1228
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:19,073
He was a real handful...

1229
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:23,619
but when it came down to it,
he was very brave.

1230
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:28,624
What happened to the rest
of the kids who went with you?

1231
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:29,959
The X-Men?

1232
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:34,547
Hank and I are the only ones left.

1233
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:37,508
I couldn't save the rest of them.

1234
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:40,511
I told you, I'm not a hero.

1235
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:42,888
Well, you're a hero to us.

1236
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:45,349
Seeing you that day on TV

1237
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:46,767
changed my life.

1238
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,394
Mine, too.

1239
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:50,438
Mine, too.

1240
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:55,860
I still live in my mom's
basement but, you know...

1241
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:57,695
Everything else is, uh...

1242
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,365
Oh, it's pretty much the same.

1243
01:42:03,242 --> 01:42:04,619
I'm a total loser.

1244
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:07,098
What we're seeing is a magnetic phenomenon

1245
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:09,809
on a much larger scale than
what we saw at Auschwitz.

1246
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:12,520
The ground is full of magnetic elements.

1247
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:14,313
Iron, nickel, cobalt.

1248
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,857
The ocean's floor is lined with them, too.

1249
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:19,694
It's already begun at the lowest depths.

1250
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,988
Land masses will slow it, but not for long.

1251
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:25,991
Eventually, cities, urban centers...

1252
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:28,452
Anything built since the Bronze Age...

1253
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:29,870
will be wiped away.

1254
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:31,455
The death toll will be in the billions.

1255
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:34,208
He's talking about the whole goddamn world.

1256
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,592
You're just another false god.

1257
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:27,928
And whoever's left to follow
you when this all over...

1258
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:31,182
They will betray you again.

1259
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,352
You're wrong, Charles.

1260
01:44:35,728 --> 01:44:39,356
For the first time in a thousand lifetimes...

1261
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,025
I have you.

1262
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:47,072
For all my gifts, I have yet
to possess the one I needed most.

1263
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:48,949
To be...

1264
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:51,619
Everywhere.

1265
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:55,873
To be...

1266
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:57,875
Everyone.

1267
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:15,601
Seventh wonder, twelve o'clock.

1268
01:45:23,901 --> 01:45:25,861
He has the Professor
in the center of the pyramid.

1269
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:30,407
He's going to transfer his
consciousness into the Professor.

1270
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:31,575
If he does that...

1271
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:34,912
He'll have the power to control
every mind in the world.

1272
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:44,129
What the hell is that?

1273
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:46,257
It's Erik.

1274
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,342
Huh?

1275
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:58,102
You guys help Nightcrawler
get into the pyramid.

1276
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:02,606
Get Charles.
I'll take care of Erik.

1277
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:04,608
How are we gonna get through that?

1278
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:06,569
I can get you in there.

1279
01:46:07,236 --> 01:46:08,779
I came here for him.
Let me help you.

1280
01:46:10,155 --> 01:46:12,783
The rest of you, get Charles on this
plane and get him out of here.

1281
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:14,618
- We're not leaving without you!
- Don't worry.

1282
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:16,495
We'll catch up.

1283
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:17,830
Hold on.

1284
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:49,653
Hank, you go with the kids.

1285
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,114
- Moira will be waiting on the plane.
- Wait.

1286
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:53,490
What?

1287
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,993
Not all of us can fully control our powers.

1288
01:46:56,493 --> 01:46:57,786
Then don't.

1289
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,830
You need to embrace them.

1290
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:04,251
We all do.

1291
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,153
Go. Join the others.

1292
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,490
Protect me, until the transference is complete.

1293
01:47:59,682 --> 01:48:01,183
There's an entrance. It's clear.

1294
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:07,106
Kurt! Get in there!

1295
01:48:18,075 --> 01:48:19,410
In the pyramid! Move!

1296
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:21,120
Go!

1297
01:48:57,614 --> 01:48:58,741
Split them up.

1298
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:23,474
Professor...

1299
01:49:27,436 --> 01:49:28,645
Kurt, you have to hurry!

1300
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:30,939
I'm trying. It's like a maze in here.

1301
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:42,326
Kurt, no!

1302
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:08,560
The magnetic field is too strong.

1303
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:09,686
I can't get us in there.

1304
01:50:12,689 --> 01:50:13,774
Erik!

1305
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:22,533
Mystique.

1306
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:29,289
I know you think you've lost everything.

1307
01:50:30,082 --> 01:50:31,500
But you haven't.

1308
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,170
You have me.

1309
01:50:35,546 --> 01:50:37,297
You have Charles.

1310
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:46,056
You have more family than you know.

1311
01:50:47,182 --> 01:50:49,893
You never had the chance
to save your family before.

1312
01:50:51,019 --> 01:50:52,729
But you do now.

1313
01:50:55,357 --> 01:50:57,901
That's what I've come here to tell you.

1314
01:51:03,282 --> 01:51:04,908
And you?

1315
01:51:13,709 --> 01:51:15,377
I'm your...

1316
01:51:19,715 --> 01:51:22,092
I'm here for my family, too.

1317
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:13,268
Get out. Get out!

1318
01:52:13,352 --> 01:52:14,561
Get out!

1319
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:22,986
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

1320
01:52:34,623 --> 01:52:35,999
We're losing him.

1321
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:53,141
I'll be right back.

1322
01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:05,529
Scott, glasses on!

1323
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:16,373
Let's go!

1324
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:34,891
- Locked on.
- Here we go.

1325
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:53,910
Psylocke!

1326
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:11,511
What the hell was that?

1327
01:54:18,185 --> 01:54:19,227
Kurt.

1328
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:20,771
Everyone, grab hold of Nightcrawler!

1329
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:22,522
I've never done it with this many people.

1330
01:54:22,606 --> 01:54:23,774
Get us out of here.

1331
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:40,624
Kurt, hurry!

1332
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,126
Kurt!

1333
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:10,779
Charles...

1334
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:17,702
Is he okay?

1335
01:55:17,828 --> 01:55:20,038
It's his energy. He's drained.

1336
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:22,499
Get out.

1337
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:24,251
Get out!

1338
01:55:24,334 --> 01:55:26,837
Professor, it's okay.
You're with us.

1339
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:29,339
It's okay.

1340
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:40,600
I'm going to fight for what I have left.

1341
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,939
Are you?

1342
01:55:58,785 --> 01:56:01,371
There's so much more
to you than you know.

1343
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:04,541
Not just pain and anger.

1344
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:06,460
There's good, too. I felt it.

1345
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,962
It's not just me you're walking away from.

1346
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:11,131
Here, you have the chance
to be a part of something

1347
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:13,216
much bigger than yourself.

1348
01:56:13,258 --> 01:56:16,219
And it needs you, Erik.

1349
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:47,125
Useless.

1350
01:56:52,464 --> 01:56:53,798
<i>Charles.</i>

1351
01:56:56,092 --> 01:56:58,178
I know you can hear me.

1352
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:02,098
We're still connected.

1353
01:57:05,852 --> 01:57:06,853
Charles!

1354
01:57:07,979 --> 01:57:09,439
Show yourself!

1355
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:12,609
Charles!

1356
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:15,612
Show yourself!

1357
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:47,060
Foolish child.

1358
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:57,529
Peter.

1359
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:14,838
End him.

1360
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:42,532
Raven.

1361
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:52,208
The great hero.

1362
01:58:57,255 --> 01:58:58,465
I'm going out there.

1363
01:58:58,548 --> 01:58:59,549
I'm going with you.

1364
01:58:59,633 --> 01:59:00,884
No.

1365
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:03,386
It's me he wants.

1366
01:59:03,428 --> 01:59:04,554
Charles, you can't give yourself up.

1367
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:06,973
If he has you, he has us all.

1368
01:59:07,057 --> 01:59:08,892
The whole world.

1369
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:10,810
You are feeble.

1370
01:59:10,894 --> 01:59:12,562
Just like the others.

1371
01:59:13,146 --> 01:59:15,106
Charles! Come!

1372
01:59:15,231 --> 01:59:16,941
Rescue your weaklings!

1373
01:59:18,318 --> 01:59:20,153
Give your life for theirs!

1374
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:23,239
No.

1375
01:59:31,331 --> 01:59:32,415
He was right.

1376
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:36,002
There is still some part of me
connected to him.

1377
01:59:36,961 --> 01:59:38,213
Charles!

1378
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:39,589
I can get inside his head.

1379
01:59:39,673 --> 01:59:41,591
Will you do nothing?

1380
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:44,761
Thank you for letting me in.

1381
01:59:53,103 --> 01:59:54,145
Uh...

1382
02:00:02,946 --> 02:00:04,447
You want what I have?

1383
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:06,783
You want to feel what I feel?

1384
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:19,963
Welcome to my world!

1385
02:00:22,632 --> 02:00:23,633
You're in my house now!

1386
02:00:30,974 --> 02:00:32,142
Mmm.

1387
02:00:34,018 --> 02:00:36,020
You'll need a bigger house.

1388
02:01:55,433 --> 02:01:57,101
You betray me?

1389
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:58,228
No.

1390
02:01:59,103 --> 02:02:00,605
I betrayed them.

1391
02:02:28,466 --> 02:02:29,759
Let's jump.

1392
02:02:29,801 --> 02:02:30,969
What?

1393
02:02:36,432 --> 02:02:37,433
Cover me.

1394
02:02:39,853 --> 02:02:41,354
I got you.

1395
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:47,777
Come on!

1396
02:03:09,007 --> 02:03:11,634
They lack strength, Charles.

1397
02:03:17,807 --> 02:03:19,058
Jean.

1398
02:03:24,731 --> 02:03:26,024
Come here.

1399
02:03:38,411 --> 02:03:39,704
Help...

1400
02:03:42,206 --> 02:03:43,541
me.

1401
02:03:48,421 --> 02:03:49,839
Stay here.

1402
02:03:59,098 --> 02:04:00,683
They can't stop him.

1403
02:04:00,767 --> 02:04:02,560
Jean.

1404
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:07,190
Help me!

1405
02:04:30,254 --> 02:04:31,381
Hank!

1406
02:04:32,298 --> 02:04:33,424
Hank!

1407
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:43,935
It's over, Charles.
You're finished.

1408
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,603
You're mine now.

1409
02:04:48,064 --> 02:04:50,733
You will never win.

1410
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:53,152
And why is that?

1411
02:04:53,236 --> 02:04:55,405
Because you are alone.

1412
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:00,576
And I am not!

1413
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:13,798
<i>Let...</i>

1414
02:05:14,257 --> 02:05:15,633
go.

1415
02:05:16,259 --> 02:05:18,094
<i>Unleash your power, Jean.</i>

1416
02:05:19,512 --> 02:05:20,805
No fear.

1417
02:06:08,978 --> 02:06:11,147
Unleash your power!

1418
02:06:11,647 --> 02:06:13,316
Let go, Jean!

1419
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:15,693
Jean, let go!

1420
02:06:51,562 --> 02:06:53,189
He's getting away.

1421
02:07:10,706 --> 02:07:14,377
All is revealed.

1422
02:08:16,147 --> 02:08:17,940
Charles! Charles!

1423
02:08:19,442 --> 02:08:20,484
- We've lost him!
- Charles.

1424
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:22,320
- He's gone.
- No, Charles.

1425
02:08:22,445 --> 02:08:23,446
Charles...

1426
02:08:23,863 --> 02:08:25,114
No, he's not.

1427
02:08:26,490 --> 02:08:27,700
I can still feel him.

1428
02:08:41,214 --> 02:08:42,215
Mmm.

1429
02:08:51,891 --> 02:08:53,559
Thank you, Jean.

1430
02:08:55,686 --> 02:08:56,687
Charles?

1431
02:08:57,688 --> 02:08:59,315
Charles, do you know where you are?

1432
02:09:02,735 --> 02:09:04,403
I'm on a beach.

1433
02:09:10,534 --> 02:09:12,203
In Cuba.

1434
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:15,331
With you.

1435
02:09:15,414 --> 02:09:17,250
What beach?

1436
02:09:24,423 --> 02:09:25,675
Charles Xavier.

1437
02:09:52,743 --> 02:09:53,869
I'm sorry.

1438
02:09:54,787 --> 02:09:57,206
I should never have taken those from you.

1439
02:10:00,584 --> 02:10:01,711
Hold on!

1440
02:10:06,716 --> 02:10:08,050
What did I miss?

1441
02:10:10,886 --> 02:10:13,389
<i>It seems only by the grace of God</i>

1442
02:10:13,472 --> 02:10:14,807
<i>that the ominous destruction</i>

1443
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:17,727
<i>seen from one end of the globe
to the other, has stopped.</i>

1444
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:18,978
<i>At a debriefing today,</i>

1445
02:10:19,061 --> 02:10:20,730
<i>CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert</i>

1446
02:10:20,813 --> 02:10:22,732
<i>revealed to an investigative committee...</i>

1447
02:10:22,773 --> 02:10:24,400
<i>The committee was further
stunned to learn that</i>

1448
02:10:24,483 --> 02:10:25,818
<i>fugitive Erik Lehnsherr</i>

1449
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:28,404
<i>aided in defeating this
powerful and unknown...</i>

1450
02:10:28,487 --> 02:10:30,614
I think our prayers were answered.

1451
02:10:31,407 --> 02:10:32,908
Thank you, Mr. President.

1452
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:34,452
<i>The potential destructive power of mutants</i>

1453
02:10:34,577 --> 02:10:36,746
<i>is sure to fuel new controversy and debate</i>

1454
02:10:36,829 --> 02:10:39,123
<i>at a time when mutants
were becoming accepted</i>

1455
02:10:39,248 --> 02:10:40,583
<i>around the world.</i>

1456
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:10,154
Mystique told me he is your father.

1457
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,324
Are you gonna tell him?

1458
02:11:14,617 --> 02:11:15,618
I might...

1459
02:11:16,494 --> 02:11:17,661
One day.

1460
02:11:19,288 --> 02:11:20,790
I think for now, I'm just
gonna stick around here

1461
02:11:20,831 --> 02:11:22,166
for a while.

1462
02:11:27,963 --> 02:11:29,131
Me, too.

1463
02:11:40,184 --> 02:11:43,187
The world's already begun
rebuilding its arsenals.

1464
02:11:43,813 --> 02:11:46,065
It's human nature, Charles.

1465
02:11:47,817 --> 02:11:49,151
I still have hope.

1466
02:11:50,403 --> 02:11:51,404
Oh, yes.

1467
02:11:52,863 --> 02:11:53,906
"Hope."

1468
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:56,659
I was right about Raven.

1469
02:11:57,368 --> 02:11:59,036
I was even right about you.

1470
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:04,041
What about the rest of the world?

1471
02:12:05,918 --> 02:12:08,671
Doesn't it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night?

1472
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:14,009
The feeling that one day
they'll come for you...

1473
02:12:14,051 --> 02:12:16,178
and your children.

1474
02:12:17,555 --> 02:12:19,390
It does, indeed.

1475
02:12:19,515 --> 02:12:22,268
What do you do when you wake up to that?

1476
02:12:23,519 --> 02:12:26,063
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul

1477
02:12:26,188 --> 02:12:29,442
that comes to my school
looking for trouble.

1478
02:12:34,447 --> 02:12:36,699
You're sure I can't convince you to stay?

1479
02:12:38,367 --> 02:12:40,202
You're psychic, Charles.

1480
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:42,538
You can convince me to do anything.

1481
02:12:45,374 --> 02:12:46,959
Goodbye, old friend.

1482
02:12:47,918 --> 02:12:49,545
Good luck, Professor.

1483
02:12:54,925 --> 02:12:56,385
Forget everything you think you know.

1484
02:12:58,304 --> 02:13:00,723
Whatever lessons you learned in school...

1485
02:13:02,099 --> 02:13:04,059
Whatever your parents taught you.

1486
02:13:05,561 --> 02:13:08,397
None of that matters!

1487
02:13:09,815 --> 02:13:11,650
You're not kids anymore.

1488
02:13:12,276 --> 02:13:13,903
You're not students.

1489
02:13:18,073 --> 02:13:19,950
You're X-Men.
