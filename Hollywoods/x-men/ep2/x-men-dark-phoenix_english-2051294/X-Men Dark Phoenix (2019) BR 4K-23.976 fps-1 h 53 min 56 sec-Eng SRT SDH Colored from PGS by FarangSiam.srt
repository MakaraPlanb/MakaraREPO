Hello.

32
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,845
Where are my parents?

33
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,307
My name's Charles Xavier, and...

34
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,101
They're dead.

35
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,519
Aren't they?

36
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,150
Yes, they are.

37
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,862
And I'm very sorry
to have to tell you that.

38
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,159
So what happens to me now?

39
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,520
Well, that's why I'm here, actually.

40
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,875
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« You see, I have a school »</i></font>

41
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,295
that is for young people,
who are like you.

42
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,588
Special.

43
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,965
Special is just a nice word for...

44
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,768
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Weird? Or crazy? »</i></font>

45
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,595
Yep.

46
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,680
Yep, sometimes it is.

47
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,640
Ooh.

48
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,893
Sometimes, it can be a word

49
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,103
used to describe people
who are significant.

50
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,022
Or amazing. Or...

51
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,066
Or just... just really cool.

52
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,196
You've got gifts, Jean.

53
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,117
Do you know what?

54
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,580
Take this pen, right.

55
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,374
It's something that...

56
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,586
Well, actually, just take it.

57
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,129
It's a gift.

58
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,511
Now, you could choose to draw

59
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,429
a really good picture with that...

60
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:09,267
or you could use it
to poke someone's eyes out.

61
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,646
But either way, it's still just a pen.

62
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,440
It's just a gift.

63
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,901
And what you choose
to do with your gift,

64
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,570
well, that's entirely up to you.

65
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,616
But if you want to use it
to do good stuff...

66
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,119
well, I can help.

67
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,540
You're not like the other doctors.

68
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,502
No.

69
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,588
And you're not like the other patients.

70
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,409
What do you think?

71
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,454
I can't stay here.

72
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,250
Okay. Why not?

73
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,085
It's too nice.

74
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,713
I...

75
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,009
- I break things.
- Well, how does this sound:

76
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,304
If you break something,
anything, I can fix it.

77
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,097
Not anything.

78
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,558
I can help you.

79
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,884
I can help you so that you never
have to break things ever again.

80
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,481
You think you can fix me too.

81
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,358
No.

82
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:48,700
No, because you are not broken.

88
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,136

91
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:03,223
- I know what you're thinking.
- That's my trick.

92
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,100
And the answer is no.
The jet can't get that high.

93
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,737
Even with the new booster rockets
and all your modifications?

94
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,281
They're built for acceleration,
not elevation, okay?

95
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,243

00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,050
- Charles?
- Mr. President.

102
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,927
Are you seeing this on TV?

103
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,595
Yes, I'm watching now.

104
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,930
Hank?

105
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,977
Yeah.

106
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,234
It's a simple extraction.

107
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,527
We go into space,

108
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,437
we get the astronauts, we bring them home.

109
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,032
- Any questions?
- Yeah, like a thousand.

110
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,594
We don't have time for a thousand.

111
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,701
So we're going to space?

112
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,786
Yes, Kurt, we are going into space.

113
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,372
We're doing space missions now.
Cool.

114
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,935
Will the X-Jet even get that high?

115
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,460
- Well, technically, the...
- It will get us there.

116
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,961
Let's go.

117
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,009
Are you okay with this?

118
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,511
I forget sometimes you can read minds.

119
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,013
I didn't need to read your mind.

120
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,432
It's written all over your face.

121
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,435
You tell me it's good, it's good.

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,687
If anything goes wrong,

123
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,397
I'll turn us around in a heartbeat.

124

Could somebody please
apprise me of the situation?

130
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,718
We were picking up solar flares.

131
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,221
We believe the heat
shorted out their electricity.

Not to worry, Mission Control.
Help is on the way.

135
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,201
I think this is not as much fun
as I thought it would be.

136
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,857
That's a solar flare?

137
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,234

- That cabin won't hold for long.
- Kurt, can you get in there?

140
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,638
It's spinning too fast.
I can't see inside the window.

141
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,848

145
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,763

<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Oh, Shit. »</i></font>

147
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,119
- Strap in, we're headed home.
- Wait.

148
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,079
Our commander, he's not here.

149
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,907

150
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,838

151
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,048
I can't hold it any longer.

152
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,801
We gotta get out of here.
I said strap in.

153
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,304
No, Raven. No.
We're not leaving anyone behind.

154
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,723
I am not putting this team in more danger.

155
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,808
What about their team?

156
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,457
Jean can hold that shuttle together.

157

<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Can't you, Jean? »</i></font>

158
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,440
You know you can do anything
you set your mind to.

159
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,234
I can hold the ship together
but not from here.

160
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,737
- I need to get inside.
- The heat's spiking.

161
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,994
We've got less than a minute
till those flares hit.

162
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:44,339
She said she can do it.

163

175
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,388
- Where is she?
- I'm sorry!

176
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,559
Brace for impact.

177
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,624
Is every...

178
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,210
Is everybody okay?

179
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,379
Yeah, we're okay.

180
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,885
So let's go home.

181
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,023
- Yay, X-Men! Woo!
- Yeah!

182
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,155
Yeah! X-Men!

185
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,437

exactly why they need us,

186

people like yourselves.

187
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,608

190
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:53,483
never been prouder.

191
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,535
Enjoy yourselves.
You certainly deserve it.

192
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,828
In fact, you all do.

193
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,346
No more class,
the end of the day.

194
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,208
Jean?

195
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,629
You gave us quite a scare up there.
How are you feeling?

196
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,550
Actually, I... I feel fine.

197
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,677
- Hank?
- Yeah?

198
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,065
Would you take a look at Jean?

199
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,222

- Thankfully, she's not.

203
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,778
I basically did everything.

204
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,239
I mean, Jean did a little,
like towards the end,

205
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,033
but it was mostly all me.

You put those kids in danger.

208
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,962
They're not kids anymore, Raven.

209
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,550
And I care about their safety
just as much as you do.

210
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,802
Are you sure about that?

211
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,472
'Cause we're taking bigger
and bigger risks.

You like it, don't you?

217
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,192
As opposed to being
hunted and despised?

218
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,652
Well, you know, actually, I do.

220
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,448
- What end is that?
- Keeping us safe.

221
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,227
You should understand
better than anyone

222
00:19:19,237 --> 00:19:20,868
that we're only ever one bad day away

223
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,204
from them starting to see us
as the enemy again.

224
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,539
So, what?
We wear matching costumes

225
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,114
and smile in pictures
to make everyone feel safe?

226
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,298
That is a small price to pay
for keeping the peace.

227
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:32,561
- By risking our people to save theirs?
- Yes! Yes!

228
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,052
It's funny.

229
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,221
I can't actually remember the last time

230
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,826
you were the one risking something.

00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,328

The genetic reading,

237
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,532
I'm gonna take another look at.

238
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,412
What can't be right?

239
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,452
Did you just read my mind
without permission?

240
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:11,591
Sorry, I didn't mean to,
but what can't be right?

241
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,549
Whatever happened up there
made you stronger.

242
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,018
You know, I've never seen
a power reading like this.

243
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:22,722
You're... You're literally...
I mean, you're off the charts.

244
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,057
So what does that mean?

245
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,393
It means, um...

246
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,980
we'll have to build a better machine.

247
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,233
But... how do you feel?

248
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,737
I feel good.

249
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,071
Good.

250
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,575
Well, as far as I can tell,
you're good to go.

251
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,869
- You can head upstairs.
- All right.

252
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,664

258
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
Constantly.

259
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,353
- Jean. Jean...
- Hmm?

260
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,796
Are you... Are you sure you're okay?

261

I'm better than okay.
God, I feel great, I do.

262
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,991
I don't know,
I feel like everything is just...

263
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,826
turned up.

264
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,621
Yeah.

265
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,832
- No, it's just...
- Just what?

266
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,837
I thought I lost you today.

267
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,422
I know.

268
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,259
But I came back to you.

269
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,471
I'll always come back to you.

270
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,921
Is that Luna?

271
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,882
Probably just squirrels.

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,236
Mm...?

273
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,181
I'm just gonna check on her.
I'll be right back.

274
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,307
Just stay.

275
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,437

- Luna!

276

280
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,956
He's got the dumbest laugh.

281

That's not...

282
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,216
That's not how it happened.

283
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,754

302
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,583
- thirsty.
- Yeah, I see that.

303
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,502
Does she seem okay to you?

309
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:24,064
Yeah. Last of the first class.

310
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,316
I've been thinking.

311
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,696
Maybe it's time for us to...
move on.

312
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,865
What do you... Move on where?

313
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,201
I don't know. It's just Charles.

314
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,677
Whatever is going on between you two,
it will blow over.

315
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,748
No, it won't.

316
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,125
I love him, but he's different.

317
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,628
Everything is... it's different now.

318
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,297
Yeah.

319
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,966
We changed the world
so we could live in it.

320
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,177
Yeah, but maybe
that's what we should go do.

321
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,721
Yeah, but this is our life.
This is what we wanted.

322
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,723
- Not like this.
- Raven...

323
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,810
It's not our life, Hank. It's his.

324
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,481

Thank you.

329
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,248
All I've really done is create a world

330
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:27,294
in which children
can find peace and pride

331
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,463
in being different.

332
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:33,634
Now, I know that some of you
choose to call us "superheroes."

333
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,637
I must confess, I don't really
know what that word means,

334
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,286
but it is a damn sight better
than what you used to call us.

335
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,647
- Come dance with me.
- You wanna dance?

336
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,190
Come on, Scott.

337
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,027
Did... Did you hear
what the kids are calling you?

338
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,279
- Do I wanna know?
- Yeah.

339
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,864
Phoenix.

340
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,076
It's cool, right?
You know, a bird that rises from the dead.

341
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,410
Whoa!

342
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,081
Uh...

343
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,034
You okay?
Hey, maybe we should take a break.

344
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,043
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« - Jean. »</i></font>
- Stop.

345
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,508
Wait, wait, wait.

346
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,927
No, stop, stop, stop, stop.

347
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,598
It's Jean.

348
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,646
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Jean. Jean, please. »</i></font>

349
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,691
Stop, stop, stop.

350
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,317
Stop, stop, stop!

351
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,094
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Charles.

352
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,524
I'm terribly sorry, everyone,
but I'm going to have to leave.

353
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,620
Thank you very, very much.

354
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,419
What is it? What do you see?

355
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,962
Nothing.

356
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,882
Her mutation has grown too powerful.

357
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,343
For the first time,
I can't penetrate her mind.

358
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,261
So that's what we're doing down here?

359
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,931
Hank built Cerebro to amplify my power.

360
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,351
I think that's the only way I'm going
to get inside her head now.

361
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,248
Hank, could you turn it up, please?

362
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,044
A little more. Thank you.

363
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,382
There she is.

364
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,518
<font color="#00ffff"><i>«  - Yes, it is.
- Isn't that yummy? »</i></font>

365
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,562
Is it supposed to look like this?

366
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,857
The mind of a psychic is a fragile thing.

367
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,734
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« It takes only the slightest tap »</i></font>

368
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,611
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« to tip it in the wrong direction. »</i></font>

369
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:43,156
I had to make adjustments
to her mind when she was young.

370
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,868
What kind of adjustments?

371
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,453
Scaffolding.

372
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,374
Walls, rather, to keep out all the trauma.

373
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,127
What did you do to her, Charles?

374
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,629
I saved her.

375
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,720
I think that whatever happened in space
did something to her.

376
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,972
In the process, those walls that I erected

377
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,099
are being torn down.

378
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,520
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« Quiet! »</i></font>

379
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,940
What is that?

380
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:20,527
That... is what I was trying
to save her from.

381
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,990
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« Table for one. My usual. »</i></font>

382
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,825
What is that voice?

383
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,995
- No...
- Charles?

384
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,749
Charles?

385
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,754
She's waking up.

386
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,343
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Jean? »</i></font>

387
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,970
Jean, don't be afraid. It's only me.

388
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,222
I want you to remain calm,

389
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,434
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« and I'd like you to focus on my voice. »</i></font>

390
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,479
Get out of my head.

391
00:30:56,646 --> 00:31:00,734
Just stay calm, Jean.

392
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,196
She's fighting me.
I need you to turn it up.

393
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,034
I heard my father.

394
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,747
- He's alive.
- You're just hearing things.

395
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,749
Jean, your mind, it needs rest.

396
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,126
You're...

397
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,045
You're lying to me.

398
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,964
I can sense it.

399
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,343
Turn it up.

400
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,096
- No, it's too much already.
- Don't do it, Hank.

401
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,430
- Hank.
- No, I won't do it.

402
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,850
For God's sake, Charles!

403
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,229
<i>Get out of my head!</i>

404
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,605
Charles!

405
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,981
- Charles!
- Charles!

406
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,569
Jean! Are you...

407
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,696
Are you okay?

408
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,990
What happened?
We were outside, and then...

409
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,159
You had an accident. You blacked out.

410
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,540
Did I... Did I do... do that?

411
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,583
It's fine.

412
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,838
- No, it's not fine.
- It was an accident.

413
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,714
I don't know what's happening to me.

414
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,092
I can't control it.
I can't stay here, Scott.

415
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,260
I really, I need to go.

416
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,387
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

417
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,524
I need to see...
I need to see my father.

418
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,352
- Your fa... Your father's...
- He's alive. I can hear him.

419
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,104
He died in the crash, remember?

420
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,939
I'm sorry, Scott. I need to go.

421
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,722
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- God, please let me go.

422
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,109
- Please.
- Slow down, please.

423
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,404
I can't control it when it comes.
I can't stop it.

424
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,281
Okay? I could hurt you again.

425
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,283
I'll take that chance.

426
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,205
I know.

427
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,750
I know.

428
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,295
But I won't.

429
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,974
- Is he gonna be all right?
- I'm gonna be fine.

430
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,928
- No, he's not fine.
- I'm going to be fine.

431
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,102
What did you see?

432
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,316
She's all desire.

433
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:08,195
All rage, all pain.

434
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,866
And it's all coming out at once.

435
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,036
Something's happening to her, Raven.

436
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,079
She's changing.

437
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,373
Into what?

438
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,126
I don't know.

439
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,755
Jean's gone. She left.

440
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,673
- Gone where?
- I don't know.

441
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,584
Charles, you can track her with your mind.

442
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,594
Not anymore.

443
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,346
She's grown too powerful, even for me.

444
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,348
She said she was going to see her father.

445
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,476
That doesn't make any sense, right?

446
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,438
Prepare the jet.
We're going to bring her home.

447
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,774
"We"? Charles, you're in no condition.

448
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,443
I have to stop this.
She's going to find...

449
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,696
She's going to find nothing good there.

450
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:09,297
So this is all that's left
of the D'Bari Empire?

451
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,344
Greetings, Vuk.

452
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,681
Have you learned their language?

453
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,099
With ease.

454
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,976
What have you learned?

455
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,771
The power is being contained
inside one of them.

456
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,609
- This primitive species?
- She's stronger.

457
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,861
A mutant.

458
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,519
She has no idea what's happening to her.

459
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,659
I can use that.

460
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,786
If we can control that power...

461
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,455
we can resurrect our race.

462
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,082
Begin again.

463
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,794
Here.

464
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,048
Where is she?

465
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,584
Can I help you?

466
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,879
Dad?

467
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,352
Jean.

how do you know where she is?

470
00:35:58,175 --> 00:35:59,926
You know how.

I protected her.

474
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,046
From the truth.

475
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,010
There's another word for that.

476
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,224
He told me you were dead.

00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,401
All of it.

480
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:43,159
Can I get you something to drink or...
to eat?

481
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,286
Uh...

482
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,122
No, I'm good. I'm...

483
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,499
I'm really good.

484
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,922
It's so good to see you.

485
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,971
Um, I'll get you some water, okay?

489

You never looked for me.

490
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,335
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« - Jean... »</i></font>
- Why didn't you look for me?

491
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,295
Maybe we should sit down.

492
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,922
No, I don't wanna sit down.

493
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,257
Why didn't you come looking for me?

494
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,511
And don't try to lie.
I can read your mind.

You didn't even say goodbye.

500
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,779
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to your mother.

501
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,489
I was eight years old.

502
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,033
How could you do that to me?

503
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,160
You wanna come in?

504
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,790
Come all the way in.

505
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,376

<font color="#00ffff"><i>« Quiet! »</i></font>

508
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,520
No. No.

509
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,990
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« I'm sorry, Jean... »</i></font>

510
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,909
but my whole world died that day.

511
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,415
And... you went with it.

512
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,339
Jean, don't, please.

513
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,632
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Stop that. »</i></font>

514
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,758
Stop it.

515
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,844
It's not me. It's them.

516
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:14,212
You shouldn't have come here.

517
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,215
Why is that?
We've only come to bring you home, Jean.

518
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:19,876
I don't have a home.
You made sure of that.

519
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,378
Look, your father couldn't handle you,

520
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,005
and we took you in.

521
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,424
You told me my father was dead,

522
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,051
and you used me for my powers.

523
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,179
No, that's just not true.
That's not what happened.

524
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,931
Jean, we can help you.

525
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,058
I can help you,
but you have to listen to me.

526
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,768
No. No, I don't.

527
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,353
Scott.

528
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,524
He lied to me, Scott. About everything.

529
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,130
We'll figure everything out together.
Just come back to me.

530
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,184
Remember,
you said you'd always come back to me.

531
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,908
Come back to me.

532
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,581
Jean.

533
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,504
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

534
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,797
Stay away from me!

535
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,052
- Stop her quickly!
- Charles, wait, wait!

536
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,898
Jean, please!

537
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,688
Jean, stop!

538
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,357
- I've got the shot. I'm taking..
- No, you're not.

539
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,985
I'm sorry, Hank.
I want Raven to have a chance.

540
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,075
I told you to stay away.

541
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,827
That's never gonna happen.

542
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,582
Please. Stop.

543
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,542
Not until I know you're gonna be okay.

544
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,670
Something's happening to me.

545
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,006
So come home.

546
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,799
Let me take care of you.

547
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,468
No, you can't.

548
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,344
You can't. You don't...

549
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,767
You don't know what it's like.

550
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,019
Then tell me.

551
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,730
When it comes...

552
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,151
people get hurt.

553
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,404
I'm not afraid of you, Jean.

554
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,447
Look at me.

555
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,491
Focus on my voice.

556
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,618
We're going to get through this together.

557
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,578
I'm not giving up on you, Jean.

558
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,372
This is what family does.
We take care of each other.

559
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,666
You're my family, Jean.

560
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,293
No matter what.

561
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,377
Stop!

562
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,757
- Raven...
- I can't catch my breath.

563
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,761
No.

564
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,472
I love you.

565
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,558
What?

566
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,647
I...

567
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,445
Raven, please.

568
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,201
Raven.

569
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,038
Raven. I love you, Raven.

570
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,625
No.

571
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,462
No.

572
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,617
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« We are all at war, »</i></font>

573

574
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,165

<font color="#ffff00"><i>« helping a friend, »</i></font>

578
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,886
a friend in need.

579
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,349
She is not gone.

580
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,394
She lives on, through me,

581
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,647
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« through us... »</i></font>

582
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,816

583
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,994
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Is it true? »</i></font>

584
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,871
Jean killed her?

585
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,299
She didn't know what she was doing.

586
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,135
Jean lost control.

587
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,347
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« But she... she's still Jean. »</i></font>

588
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,183
She's still our friend.

589
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,769
We can still help her.
We can find her.

590
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,605
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« And bring her home. »</i></font>

591
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,653
That's...
That's what we're gonna do, okay?

592
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,749
It wasn't an accident, Scott.

593
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,336
She killed Raven.

594
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,880
Maybe you can't admit that
to yourself or to them,

595
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,757
but it's the truth.

596
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,511
That was not Jean, not the Jean I know.

597
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,642
Sometimes you want to believe

598
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,728
people are something that they are not.

599
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,149
And then, by the time
you realize who they are...

600
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,776
it's too late.

601
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,056
Do you know, this is where
I first met Raven.

602
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,189
She was just this little girl, and...

603
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,067
she'd broken in, looking for food.

604
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,235
I said she could stay,

605
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,530
and that she'd never have
to go hungry again.

606
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:50,910
And then,
I think I promised her a better life.

607
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,789
And then you took it from her.

608
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,500
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me.

609
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,960
- Hank...
- This is your fault, Charles.

610
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,589
It's your fault she's dead.

611
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,467
- Come on, that's not fair.
- Fair? No, don't talk about fair.

612
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,334
You messed with the mind
of an eight-year-old girl.

613
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,835
You pushed down all that pain and anger...

614
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,170
- Jean?
- ...where do you think it's gonna go?

615
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,659
I did that to help her. What I do,

616
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,028
- I do to help all of them.
- Please, come on, please.

617
00:48:15,038 --> 00:48:17,645
- You still can't see what you did wrong?
- It's just...

618
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,272
No, you need to face this, Charles!
You need to face it.

619
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,183
Come on, admit it to me right now.
Come on!

620
00:48:22,193 --> 00:48:23,444
Admit it!

621
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,695
Charles, just admit you were wrong,
please.

622
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,536
You still can't.

623
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,666
I really hope you feel better, Hank.

624
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,420
I hope that railing on me five minutes
after I put my foster sister in the grave

625
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,994
- has made you feel...
- This isn't about me.

626
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,352
You, know what?
I know what I did wrong, okay, Charles?

627
00:48:46,362 --> 00:48:48,384
She was gonna leave.
Raven was gonna leave,

628
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,886
and I talked her out of it.

629
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,474
She saw what the rest of us didn't.

630
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,727
And what was that?

631
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,219
This whole time, we've been trying

632
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,838
to protect these kids from the world,

633
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:04,240
when really, we should've been
protecting them from you.

634
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,534
I don't know what's happening to me.

635
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,122
Why?

636
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,626
Why did I do that?

637
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,449
- No civilians past this...
- FBI.

638
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,333
Give us the room.

639
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,928
And who are you supposed to be?

640
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,600
We're the ones who are going
to help you, Mr. Grey.

641
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,438
I didn't know she was gonna come back.

642
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,108
I'm sorry for all this.

643
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,111
It's okay.

644
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,954
We just wanna get
an accurate picture of who Jean is.

645
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,331
Tell us about when you gave her
to the mutant.

646
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,795
Um...

647
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,257
Maybe, uh...

648
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:56,303
it might be better if I talk to a lawyer.

649
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,268
I'm so sorry, Mr. Grey,

650
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,812
but I need to know
everything about her now.

651
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,609
This truly is an unfortunate development.

652
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:11,986
Why... Why is that?

653
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,739
Because it's so much easier
to understand your language

654
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,408
when you're not screaming.

655
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,915
Who are you?

656
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,336
What are you doing here?

657
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,008
Answer the question.

658
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,063
Leave her.

659
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,316
Why are you here?

660
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,078
Are you hurt?

661
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,038
No.

662
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,375
You'll have to forgive them.

663
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,044
They're not accustomed
to uninvited guests.

664
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,047
Please.

665
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,417
Why don't you start at the beginning?

666
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,023
Whose blood is that?

667
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,778
- What?
- On your shirt.

668
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,904
Whose blood is it?

669
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,367
Look, I'm not Charles.

670
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,453
I can't read your mind.

671
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,294
You hurt people.

672
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,715
- It's been a while.
- But you did.

673
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,927
Yes. What did you come here to ask me?

674
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,555
How did you stop?

675
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,939
I've lived with vengeance my whole life.

676
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,818
Ever since I was a child, I...

677
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,405
lost everyone I ever loved, so...

678
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,782
I hurt people.

679
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,909
Yes, killed people.

680
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,789
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Killed whatever I thought

681
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:14,918
It didn't,

682
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,254
no matter how many souls I sent under...

683
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,967
so I stopped.

684
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,928
I don't know how to stop.

685
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,850
I don't know what's happening to me.

686
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,692
When I lose control...

687
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,822
things happen, bad things...

688
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,285
to people I love.

689
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,543
Whose blood is that?

690
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,756
Isn't that why you came here?

691
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,100
- What do you think I can do for you?
- I don't know!

692
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,177
Yes, you do. Whose blood is that?

693
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,044
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Did you hurt someone?

694
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,881
- Please, I...
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« - Answer the question, Jean. »</i></font>

695
00:55:08,964 --> 00:55:10,878
- Stop, Erik, you're making me angry.
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« - Good! »</i></font>

696
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:12,142
I want you to be angry.

697
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,176
- Show me what happens, Jean.
- I don't wanna hurt you!

698
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,882
What happens when you're angry?
Show me.

699
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:17,477
- Show me what...
- Stop!

700
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,025
We've got military.

701
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,318
Inbound.

702
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,737
Stay here.

703
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,454
Two birds. US.

704
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,873
Tell everyone to stay calm, but ready.

705
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,706
All right, that's far enough.

706
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,875
We have a legal right to be here.

707
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,378
This land was given to us
by the US government.

708
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,380
We have no intention of taking it back.

709
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:25,632
We're not here for you.

719
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,110
I know who you are.

720
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,280
- I don't wanna fight.
- No, you don't.

721
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,449
Then step aside.

722
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:54,202
We have the same rights
as you and your family.

723
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:57,122
And like I said, we're not here for you.

724
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,667
We're here for a girl
who gave up those fights

725
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:03,378
when she attacked
a squad of police officers.

726
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,173
They have families, too.

727
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,593
Guess you didn't hear about that.

728
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,847
We don't get the news out here, Captain.

729
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,605
Stop that.

730
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,440
I said stop that right now!

731
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,151

<font color="#ffff00"><i>« - It's me. »</i></font>

I can't hold it!

737

Go!

743
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,745

744
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,663

745
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:04,833

There's no need to throw away
everything that we've accomplished.

Hello, Jean.

773
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:26,308
You can't control my mind like theirs.

774
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:28,768
I'm not like them.

775
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,229
Same, please.

776
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,650
How did you find me?

777
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,738
Let's just say
I have friends in high places.

778
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,908
Who are you?

779
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,203
The better question is...

780
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,537
who are you?

781
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,039
Are you a scared little girl

782
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,041
who answers to a man in a chair...

783
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,086
or are you the most powerful creature
on the planet?

784
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,759
I don't know who I am.

785
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,219
Yes, you do.

786
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,764
You're the girl who everyone abandons.

787
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,229
Maybe they had good reason.

788
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,981
Because of what's inside you?

789
01:02:16,516 --> 01:02:19,471
You're afraid of it because you think
it makes you bad,

790
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,200
evil,

791
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:24,908
all the words you've been taught
to keep you in line.

792
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,370
Words created a very long time ago

793
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,538
by men with very little minds.

794
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:33,875
They can't begin
to comprehend what you are.

795
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,794
Even your X-Men.

796
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,546
And you can?

797
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:42,550
Charles?

798
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,263
Charles? Charles!

799
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:49,140
- Hey, Hank's not in class.
- What?

800
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:50,517
Hank's not in class.

801
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,436
Did you check his quarters?

802
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,814
Yeah, he's not there either.

803
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,831
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Where are the rest of them? »</i></font>

804
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,541
No, I'm alone.

805
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,377
What, no Charles?

806
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,892
If you're looking for Jean...

807
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,344
- she's gone.
- No, I know that.

808
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:28,221
Then why are you here, Hank?

809
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,876
You have eyes and ears around the world

810
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:32,888
to help you find mutants for this place.

811
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,770
I want you to help me find Jean.

812
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,064
I've no reason to find her.

813
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,983
Not for me.

814
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,609
Do it for Raven.

815
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:43,987
Did she send you?

816
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,033
You don't know?

817
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:52,954
Know what, Hank?

818
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,498
Raven's dead.

819
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,169
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Jean killed her. »</i></font>

820
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,984

821
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,409
If I find her, I'll kill her.

822
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,579
I know.

823
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,348
They know who I am?

824
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,474
Yes.

825
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,769
And they're not afraid of me?

826
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:03,066
The only person here
afraid of your power...

827
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,235
is you.

828
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,881
Go, gather the others.

829
01:05:20,892 --> 01:05:25,598
If she can't control it,
then we will destroy it.

830
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:34,055
This is what you wanted to show me?

831
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,473
No.

832
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,685
This is what I want to show you.

833
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,414
What entered you in space
was not a solar flare.

834
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,208
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« And it was not an accident. »</i></font>

835
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,711
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« It was drawn... to you. »</i></font>

836
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,173
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« What... What was it? »</i></font>

837
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:11,634
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« A pure and unimaginably
powerful cosmic force. »</i></font>

838
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,721
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« We saw it enter you in space. »</i></font>

839
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:19,350
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« We were there, Jean,
following that force. »</i></font>

840
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:21,853
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« Why? »</i></font>

841
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:25,148
Because it's the spark
that gave life to the universe...

842
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,526
and the flame that consumed my world.

843
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,408
What remains of my people
searched the stars

844
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,368
for that power, to control it,

845
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:41,414
but it destroyed everything

846
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,999

847
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:46,628
Why me?

848
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,547
Because you're stronger than you know.

849
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:53,051
Because you're special, Jean.

And what they don't understand, they fear.

858

And what they fear...

859
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,398

differences in the past, but...

864
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,711
We both love Raven.

01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:12,589

New York.

We'll have eyes on the ground

871
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,989
It's time.

872
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,789
We know where Jean is.

873
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,699
I thought you said you couldn't track her.

874

It wasn't me who found her.

875
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,835
It was Erik.

876
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,337
Hank's with him.

877
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,812
They're on their way to her,
and they're gonna kill her.

878
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:39,092
And anyone who stands in their way.

879
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,095
Kurt, I'd like you to take Scott
and I there, but that's all.

880
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,222
I want you to leave us there

881

And me?

882
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,684
I'm not talking to you now as X-Men.

883
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,104
Scott and I will go and fight
for Jean without you.

884

End of discussion.

885
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:56,275
Storm, I have lost
so many of the people I love.

886
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,237
I'm not going to ask you to go.

887
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,613
I am.

888
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:04,075

892
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:18,464
Kurt, close your eyes.

893
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,925
I'll show you our destination.

894
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,064
Where are they?

895
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,541
She's in there.

896
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,627
Hello, old friend.

897
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,893
Save the "old friend" shit, Charles.

898
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,394
And stay out of my way.

899
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:15,313
I'm sorry for what she did.

900
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:17,940
But I can't let you go in there.

901
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,652
You're always sorry, Charles.
And there's always a speech.

902
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,114
But nobody cares anymore.

903
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:29,911

- You have no idea who I am.

940

My kid used to be a fan.

1016
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:32,925
Raven had the right of it.

1017
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:36,512
Jean was never the villain.

1018
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,974
I was.

1019
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,438
I should never have lied to her.

1020
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,108
I was wrong.

1021
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,572
But this power...

1022
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,243
inside of her, I never put that there.

1023
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:02,287
I would never do anything
intentionally to hurt her.

1024
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:06,291
That isn't me and this is not Jean.

1025
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,294
We can still save her.

1026
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,880
She's still Jean inside.

1027
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,684
<font color="#ff8000"><i>¦ We're 10 miles out
from Mutant Containment Center. ¦</i></font>

1028
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:25,352
<font color="#ff8000"><i>¦ Prepare for prisoner transfer. ¦</i></font>

1029
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:38,031
What exactly is controlling her?

1030
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,241
I don't know.

1031
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,827
But this woman, this...

1032
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,161
thing...

1033
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:44,550
has had a taste of that power,

1034
01:24:44,634 --> 01:24:46,156
and she'll be coming back for more.

1035
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:47,811
She'll be coming back for Jean.

1036
01:24:47,895 --> 01:24:49,751
Good. Let her.

1037
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:52,212
She'll kill her to get it.

1038
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:55,090
But I promise you,
the killing will not end there.

1039
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,718
That's not what Raven would have wanted.

1040
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,720
You know that.

1041
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,847
You both do.

1042
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,409
<font color="#ff8000"><i>¦ Skipper, are you seeing this? ¦</i></font>

1043
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:27,456
Alpha One,
you have multiple hostiles onboard.

1044
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:28,974
<font color="#ff8000"><i>¦ They're heading towards the back. ¦</i></font>

1045
01:25:28,984 --> 01:25:30,792
- Open four to five.
<font color="#ff8000"><i>¦ - Copy that. ¦</i></font>

1046
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,311
All right, you two, come with me.

1047
01:25:32,321 --> 01:25:34,421
The rest of you, stay here,
guard the prisoners!

1048
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,923
Don't be fools! You need our help!

1049
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,800
Look it down! Now!

1050
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,471
Goddamn muties come to spring you.

1051
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,097
They're not mutants.

1052
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:45,877
Free us, you're going to need our help.

1053
01:25:45,887 --> 01:25:47,309
We're the only chance you have.

1054
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,685
Keep your mouth shut.

1055
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,965
<font color="#ff8000"><i>¦ Mayday! Mayday! ¦</i></font>

1056
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,729
What's the status on those mutants?

1057
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:35,190
<font color="#ff8000"><i>¦ We're falling back now! They're not... ¦</i></font>

1058
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:37,609
What?

1059
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,736
They're not what?

1060
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,414
<font color="#ff8000"><i>¦ They're not mutants! ¦</i></font>

1061
01:26:41,424 --> 01:26:43,124
They're here for Jean.

1062
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,034
Get ready to open fire!

1063
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:47,994
Your kid was right about us.

1064
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:49,287
We could help you!

1065
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:00,507
Please!

1066
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,428
Fire!

1067
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,274
There's more!

1068
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:47,471
We only want the girl. Step aside.

1069
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:48,597
No!

1070
01:27:49,965 --> 01:27:51,265
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« What he is doing? »</i></font>

1071
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:54,019
What Raven would have.

1072
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:14,790
Scott, get me to Jean!

1073
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:55,914
Selene!

1074
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:00,210
Hank!

1075
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,171
Help Storm!

1076
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:32,993
No, no, no, no, no, please.

1077
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:35,495
Don't die. No.

1078
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:30,607
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1079
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:33,345
Scott, guard the entrance.

1080
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:35,764
Jean, wake up.

1081
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,849
Jean, wake up. You have to wake up now.

1082
01:31:54,267 --> 01:31:55,067
Hank!

1083
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,027
I have no desire to fight you.

1084
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,362
I get that a lot.

1085
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:58,531
You wanted her dead.

1086
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:02,160
I had a change of heart.

1087
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:29,270
I was trying to protect you.

1088
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:32,757
I was trying to keep the pain away, but...

1089
01:33:33,141 --> 01:33:34,651
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« You just buried it. »</i></font>

1090
01:33:37,202 --> 01:33:38,095
Jean.

1091
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:42,033
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« Where...? »</i></font>

1092
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,204
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« Are we inside my mind? »</i></font>

1093
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:49,666
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« It's more peaceful than mine. »</i></font>

1094
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:56,339
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« I'm so sorry for what I did to you. »</i></font>

1095

1096
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:01,344
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« All I ever wanted was to protect you »</i></font>

1097

1100
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:26,369

1104

1105
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,154
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« Protect my family. »</i></font>

1106
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:05,325
Jean. Jean.

1107
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:30,947
You want this power?

1108
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:34,200
You're gonna get it.

1109
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:48,798
Aah! Jean!

1110
01:38:57,265 --> 01:39:00,017
<font color="#ffff00"><i>« You can't control it. »</i></font>

1111

<font color="#ffff00"><i>« If you kill me, you'll kill them all. »</i></font>

1112
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:26,419
Your emotions make you weak.

1113
01:39:34,118 --> 01:39:35,144
Jean.

1114
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:41,550
Jean!

1115
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,279
You're wrong.

1116
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:57,033
My emotions make me strong.

1117
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,193
She's gone.

1118
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:01,556
She...

1119
01:41:04,733 --> 01:41:06,069
She's free.

1120

<font color="#00ffff"><i>« I know who I am now. »</i></font>

1126
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:11,959
<font color="#00ffff"><i>« It's a new beginning. »</i></font>

1127
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:18,591
Hey, slow down. Safety first.

1128
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:24,573
How's retirement treating you?

1129
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,118
What are you doing here, Erik?

1130
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:29,203
I came to see an old friend.

1131
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,123
Fancy a game?

1132
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:36,919
No, not today. Thank you.

1133
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:44,009
A long time ago, you saved my life.

1134
01:43:46,429 --> 01:43:48,639
Then you offered me a home.

1135
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:52,309
I'd like to do the same for you.

1136
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:09,869
Just one game.

1137
01:44:11,162 --> 01:44:12,663
For old times' sake.

1138
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:27,094
I'll go easy on you.

1139
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:29,847
No, you won't.
