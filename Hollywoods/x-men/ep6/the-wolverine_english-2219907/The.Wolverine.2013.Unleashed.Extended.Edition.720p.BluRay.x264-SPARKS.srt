1
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Look! Over there!

2
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,291
Enemy's aircraft! Enemy!

3
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:06,884
Look!

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,525
Hurry up!

5
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,811
Run away!

6
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,261
Hiroshima will be attacked!

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,713
Hurry up!

8
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:14,718
Danger!

9
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,672
Hurry up!

10
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:50,712
Where are you going?

11
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,139
Help me!

12
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,140
Here!

13
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,049
Over here!

14
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:00,480
Stop fire! Stop fire! Stop fire!

15
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,250
Run away!

16
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,000
Go!

17
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,259
Go!

18
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,778
That's a B-29, bub.

19
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:35,132
There's no outrunning, what's coming.

20
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:36,362
Yashida!

21
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,554
Takashi Yashida what are you doing?

22
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,716
Hurry up!

23
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,518
Yashida! Hurry up! Come here!

24
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:44,265
You're better off down here.

25
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:45,711
Yashida!
Yes.

26
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:47,110
I'm coming...

27
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,711
I'd hurry if I were you.

28
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:55,086
Run. Now!

29
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:07,487
Stay down!

30
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:56,898
No, wait!
No, no. Wait.

31
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:00,983
No. No.

32
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,486
It's not safe.

33
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,077
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Wake up.

34
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,279
Wake up.

35
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:10,584
Where were you?

36
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,289
Nagasaki.

37
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:17,852
That far back?

38
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:27,647
You're here.

39
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:28,922
Of course.

40
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:30,209
Can you stay?

41
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:33,433
You know I can't.

42
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,686
Jean, I'm so sorry.

43
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:38,314
I know.

44
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:41,773
I'll never hurt you
or anyone ever again.

45
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,374
I made a vow.

46
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:45,719
A solemn vow?

47
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:47,839
You're making fun of me.

48
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:52,133
It's too late.

49
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,888
No!

50
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:00,835
No, Jean!

51
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,360
No, no, no, no! Please!

52
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,834
You can't hide.

53
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,871
No, no, no! Please!

54
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,348
You can't hide!

55
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,457
No, Jean!

56
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,925
No!

57
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,289
Whack all of that on store credit.

58
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:09,941
Thanks, honey.

59
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:14,595
Got the arrows?
Yeah.

60
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,390
Remember the arrows?

61
00:08:17,556 --> 00:08:19,200
Yeah, yeah, Eddie, we got them!

62
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:26,816
Yeah!

63
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:30,302
Hey, boys!

64
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:32,529
What are you doing?

65
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:34,400
Man, you almost blew his foot off!

66
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:36,304
You're not a hunter, are you?

67
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,599
Not anymore.

68
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:39,092
What the hell?

69
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,033
Don't make me do this.

70
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,288
It must have been
damn near 12 feet tall.

71
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,066
We didn't hear nothing,

72
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:46,764
except twigs.

73
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,412
Then it just came upon us.

74
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:51,408
It got Riley,

75
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,054
just gutted him.

76
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,286
It got Eddie.

77
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,404
Ripped through the tent, knocked
over the snowcat like it was a toy.

78
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,012
You the one was attacked
by the grizzly?

79
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,039
I'm the one that survived.

80
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,528
I'd like to buy this man a drink.

81
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:20,536
What's your name, mister?

82
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,732
It's Logan.

83
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:35,085
And that's a poison broadhead,

84
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,898
which last I heard was illegal.

85
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:50,729
Go ahead, ask me where I found it.

86
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:01,979
Ask me.

87
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,408
Where did you find it?

88
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:06,005
Well, funny you should ask.

89
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:08,913
I pulled it out of the back of a grizzly.

90
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,619
Whoever shot it,

91
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,659
didn't have the wind or the balls,

92
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,125
to track the animal properly,

93
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,571
and put it out of its misery.

94
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,592
Instead of dropping
a lethal dose of the poison,

95
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:23,322
it bled into the bear,

96
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:25,836
made him crazy, killed five people.

97
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,210
I don't know what you're talking about.

98
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,391
Because I don't dip
my arrows in anything.

99
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,603
In that case you got nothing
to worry about.

100
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,693
Damn.

101
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:47,745
That hurt.

102
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:51,416
Sorry, Jean.

103
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:55,064
I would not bother with them.

104
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,660
Most of them will die soon anyway,

105
00:12:57,998 --> 00:12:59,079
without your help.

106
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,586
Three of them, a week from now,

107
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:02,907
in the same truck.

108
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,544
This sword is hundreds of years old

109
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,712
and was named Danzan by the
first samurai who used it.

110
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:30,285
Danzan means separator,
in Japanese.

111
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:33,788
The ideal weapon for separating,

112
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,636
head and limb,

113
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:36,809
from body.

114
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,653
Like so.

115
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:52,695
I'm parked in back.

116
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,326
Get in.

117
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,037
Sorry, it's a rental.

118
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:21,380
Who are you?

119
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,713
Me?

120
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:24,115
I'm Yukio.

121
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:25,617
And?

122
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,886
I've been trying to find you
for over a year.

123
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:30,197
Why?

124
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:31,945
To give you that.

125
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,309
My employer wanted you to have it.

126
00:14:36,894 --> 00:14:38,062
Who's your employer?

127
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:40,140
Master Yashida.

128
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:56,444
He said it belongs to you,

129
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,388
and that he's paying all debts.

130
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,672
Master Yashida is dying.

131
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:06,258
He wants to say thank you for saving
his life all those years ago.

132
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:08,801
He knows that you are a...

133
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,053
busy man.

134
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,882
But he very much wants to say
his goodbye in person.

135
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,371
Alright, where is he?

136
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:17,910
Tokyo.

137
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,548
Wait I'm not going to Japan.

138
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,014
It would be dishonorable for
you to refuse his request.

139
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:26,690
Well, apologize to Mr. Yashida,
I'm not going to Tokyo.

140
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:29,113
Alright?
I've got things to do.

141
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:30,656
Do not apologize.

142
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:33,140
It's been an honor just
to meet the Wolverine.

143
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:38,831
That's not who I am anymore,
you understand?

144
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:41,834
Interesting.

145
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:45,937
Why did you go into that bar,
if not to seek justice?

146
00:15:45,963 --> 00:15:47,087
I don't know.
You don't know.

147
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:48,596
No!
I think you know.

148
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,509
Pull over.
You are a soldier.

149
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:51,927
No, I'm not. Pull over.

150
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,272
You are a soldier.

151
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:54,562
Pull over, now!

152
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:55,900
Now.

153
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:02,186
You are a soldier,

154
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,876
and you seek what all soldiers do.

155
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,191
And what's that?

156
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:08,363
An honorable death.

157
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:10,237
An end to your pain.

158
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,372
Who says I'm in pain?

159
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:18,526
A man who has nightmares every
night of his life is in pain.

160
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:37,550
One day.

161
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,484
I say goodbye to Mr. Yashida
and I come right back.

162
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,011
Ok.

163
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:53,242
Fifteen hours.
Depending on the wind.

164
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,949
Fifteen hours?

165
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:58,452
You don't like to fly?

166
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:00,015
I love it.

167
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,139
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

168
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:30,345
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

169
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:32,690
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

170
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:37,920
Kuzuri.
What does that mean?

171
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:39,616
Monster.

172
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:43,814
No pain?

173
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:47,402
You have no...
Oh, yeah. Pain.

174
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,501
Plenty of pain.

175
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,493
How old are you?

176
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:59,305
It's been a long time.

177
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:01,834
Many wars.

178
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:04,014
Understand?

179
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:10,857
Too many fucking wars.

180
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,078
We are almost there.

181
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:25,998
So, you can see the future?

182
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:28,830
I can read a map.

183
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:32,691
You said you knew the future
of those assholes in the bar.

184
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:35,427
I know they are going to die.

185
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,216
We are all going to die.

186
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,625
You said they would die
in the same truck, in a week.

187
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,975
If you're right, that's quite a talent.

188
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:50,041
We don't all have claws.

189
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,584
So, do I die on this plane?

190
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:58,747
No.

191
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:01,450
Not on this plane.

192
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:29,019
Don't let the lights fool you.

193
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,877
These are dark days in Japan.

194
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:34,302
Some believe when
Master Yashida got sick,

195
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,323
a shadow fell upon us.

196
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:37,903
Do you think he's a god?

197
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:40,384
No.

198
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:41,764
A man.

199
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:43,241
But a great one.

200
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:44,775
After the war,

201
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:46,592
he helped rebuild the nation.

202
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:49,320
And the family business
became Japan's largest.

203
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:52,684
Did they give you
a little card to memorize?

204
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,546
I owe Master Yashida my life.

205
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:58,632
Don't be a dick.

206
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,069
A lot of guns.

207
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:16,525
There have been attacks.

208
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,215
Attempted kidnappings.

209
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:19,874
Attempted assassinations.

210
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:20,817
By who?

211
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,476
The Japanese mob,

212
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:23,603
the Yakuza.

213
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:26,474
They've grown strong as the
government has grown weak.

214
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:27,616
Weapon reaction!

215
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:28,698
Like I said, I'm fine.

216
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,639
Show me the weapon.

217
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:31,671
I told you we're ok!
Hip replacement.

218
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:41,224
Please wear it

219
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:42,400
Too small.

220
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,346
Too small.

221
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:13,498
Hey.

222
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,129
This way.

223
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,244
Who's that?

224
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,379
Shingen,

225
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,719
Master Yashida's son.

226
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:29,239
He's good.

227
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:32,562
He's alright.

228
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,104
Long time no see.

229
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:39,704
So, what happened
to the badass in boots?

230
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,364
Master Yashida is traditional.

231
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:44,443
One eye on the past,

232
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,115
and the other on the future.

233
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:58,063
Grandpa you're still alive,
I don't want.

234
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,551
This must be done by you

235
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:02,017
That's Mariko,

236
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,156
his granddaughter.

237
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:24,168
Mariko?

238
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,296
What? What happened?

239
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,737
It's ok. It's nothing.

240
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,999
You haven't answered my emails.

241
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,182
I can't explain now.

242
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:43,782
Why did you tell me cnow?

243
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,256
Who is that dirty person?

244
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,764
The man Mr. Yashida is looking for.

245
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:56,881
Don't let grandfather meet this dirty
man like that.

246
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:09,429
Shizu and Saki are going
to disinfect you.

247
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:12,784
Give you a shave.

248
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,105
Like hell they are.

249
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:16,081
Get in the tub.

250
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:19,700
Get in the tub.

251
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,131
Really?

252
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,935
Sit down.
Sit down.

253
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,530
Sit down.
Alright.

254
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,878
Sit down-don't move anymore, hey

255
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,847
Ok. Ok.

256
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,366
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

257
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:37,012
I can do. I can do myself.

258
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:48,025
What?

259
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:51,496
What?

260
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:53,665
You look nice.

261
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,043
I feel violated.

262
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,133
Prepare two more suppressors
for Master Yashida.

263
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,359
And check his blood pressure.

264
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,239
Lord Yashida.

265
00:24:20,796 --> 00:24:22,240
As per your request.

266
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:30,348
Kuzuri.

267
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,303
You look the same.

268
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,392
But then, that is no surprise.

269
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:39,681
Dr. Green.

270
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,166
Leave us, please.

271
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,251
Five minutes, no more.

272
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:50,167
My oncologist.

273
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,185
Well done.

274
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:57,625
Oh, forget the etiquette.

275
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,739
I'm past such precautions.

276
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,086
For many years,

277
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:10,548
I have wanted to thank
you for saving my life.

278
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:12,946
Yeah well.

279
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:15,746
You were kind to me.

280
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,590
And you were kind to many people.

281
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:21,124
I saw that even from that well.

282
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:44,533
The painting is from
the village of my birth.

283
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:48,743
It depicts the bravery
and skill of the Black Clan.

284
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:50,877
Ninja warriors.

285
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:54,981
They served my family
for seven centuries.

286
00:25:56,781 --> 00:26:00,015
I didn't send for you
only to thank you, Logan.

287
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:03,785
I wanted to repay you.

288
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,886
To offer you something
no one else can.

289
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:13,799
A gift to equal the life you gave to me.

290
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:15,925
I don't need anything.

291
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:17,251
Not a thing.

292
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:20,582
Eternity can be a curse.

293
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:23,758
It hasn't been easy for you,

294
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,174
living without time.

295
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:27,804
The losses you have had to suffer.

296
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:31,149
A man can run out of things to live for.

297
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:33,424
Lose his purpose.

298
00:26:33,735 --> 00:26:35,269
Become a ronin.

299
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:39,558
A samurai without a master.

300
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:46,704
I can end your eternity.

301
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,167
Make you mortal.

302
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:52,845
What they?

303
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,608
What they did to me, what I am,

304
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:56,697
can't be undone.

305
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,499
Yashida Industries can do anything.

306
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:04,976
We have reason to believe your
ability to heal can be passed.

307
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:06,702
Passed?

308
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:08,176
From you to another.

309
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:14,529
You have struggled long enough, Logan.

310
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,413
I'm confused.

311
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:20,958
I came here to say goodbye
to a man I once knew.

312
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:22,929
I am the same man.

313
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,497
I was not ready to die then.

314
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:27,883
I am not ready to die now.

315
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:30,542
But you are...

316
00:27:31,613 --> 00:27:32,873
aren't you?

317
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,189
Are you offering to kill me?

318
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:37,800
No.

319
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:39,135
Not right away.

320
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:43,680
You can live a long and ordinary life.

321
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:45,734
Fall in love,

322
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:48,462
have a family, grow old.

323
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:51,098
And one day,

324
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,316
die an ordinary death.

325
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:00,154
It can be done.

326
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:02,812
Yeah look,

327
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,821
nice to see you again.
Sorry you got sick.

328
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,419
Please, Logan-san.

329
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:08,914
I need you again.

330
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:11,531
I fear for my family.

331
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:14,168
I fear for everything I have built.

332
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,869
Enough.
Please, Logan-san.

333
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:18,089
You should leave.
They're going to kill her.

334
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:18,923
Who?

335
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:19,886
Mariko,

336
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:21,604
my grand daughter.

337
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,191
She is my treasure.

338
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,341
She must be protected.

339
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:30,623
You don't want what I've got.

340
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:34,087
Kuzuri.

341
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:35,639
Kuzuri!

342
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:39,840
Lord Shingen,

343
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:42,395
Your father is asking for you.

344
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:46,370
The time has come.

345
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:51,926
Father! Father!

346
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:54,249
Father, please let me go.

347
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:55,204
Step aside.

348
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:57,678
You cannot go in the room.
Let me in, father!

349
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,935
You cannot go in the room, Mariko.

350
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:00,981
Let me to speak with him
before he meet my Grandfather.

351
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:02,584
Go away! Father?

352
00:29:02,586 --> 00:29:03,604
Why should I do?

353
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:05,631
Lord Shingen, will talk to you

354
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,096
tomorrow morning...
I will talk to him now. Father!

355
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:08,322
Not now, Mariko!

356
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,240
Please, father.
Leave me alone.

357
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,410
Please wait father listen to me.

358
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,305
Did I say, not now Mariko?

359
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,015
Please, father.

360
00:29:23,017 --> 00:29:24,130
Do it later!

361
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,251
Please listen to me.

362
00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:26,830
My father is living his last moments!

363
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:28,676
That's why you must listen to me now.

364
00:29:28,678 --> 00:29:29,510
Don't stop me, leave now!

365
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,200
You're always like this.

366
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,480
That's why Grandpa is so sad.

367
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,497
Mariko!

368
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,109
Careful, careful.
It's slippery out here.

369
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:03,315
Let go.

370
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,916
You about done?

371
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:09,859
Let go of me.

372
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,502
He just wanted to say goodbye?

373
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:42,483
You two grew up together.

374
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:43,903
Yes.

375
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:46,426
But you're not her sister.

376
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,708
No.

377
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:54,416
Master Yashida found me
on a trip to the South.

378
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:58,190
He brought Mariko to see
a factory he was building.

379
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:04,660
I was digging through
the garbage for something to eat.

380
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,566
So they just took you home with them?

381
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:13,088
It was always difficult for
Mariko to make friends.

382
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:25,234
I'll see to it the plane
is ready in the morning.

383
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:26,924
Sleep here.

384
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,924
Don't look so disappointed, Shingen.

385
00:31:50,384 --> 00:31:52,261
I'm not dead yet.

386
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:53,783
I'll be in my office,

387
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:55,613
if you need me.

388
00:32:01,812 --> 00:32:04,752
It's not easy to say...

389
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:10,530
But dialogue between us has always
been difficult, right?

390
00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:14,179
I have been honorable.

391
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,621
You probably did your best.

392
00:32:26,295 --> 00:32:29,966
You have always been
my assumed successor.

393
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:33,302
So the past few years as a test,

394
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,346
I allowed you more control.

395
00:32:36,472 --> 00:32:38,027
It has been an honor.

396
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:41,047
And I now realize that was a mistake.

397
00:32:42,353 --> 00:32:45,761
You have brought this
company close to ruin.

398
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:49,479
When I die,

399
00:32:49,673 --> 00:32:52,616
someone else will take
my place as chairman.

400
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,188
Father,

401
00:32:58,525 --> 00:33:00,348
I'm sorry if I have disappointed you.

402
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,580
Let's not insult one another.

403
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:06,396
You are not the man to lead Yashida.

404
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,592
You cannot bring
in someone from the outside.

405
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:15,403
In that you are correct.

406
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:39,437
I will never allow
this kind of thing to happen.

407
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:55,625
<i>Eternity can be a curse</i>

408
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,036
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

409
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:00,149
<i>You have no pain,</i>

410
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:01,683
<i>Kuzuri?</i>

411
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:02,979
How old are you?

412
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,726
Interesting offer.

413
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:11,282
What are you doing
turning the old man down?

414
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,930
I thought you wanted to be with me.

415
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,197
Come here.

416
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:07,998
He's dead.

417
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,711
I didn't foresee it.

418
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:32,938
You are a great observer
of the society, can I ask you,

419
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:35,710
what do you think about the death
of Yashida Ichiro?

420
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,020
What can I say...

421
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,150
Who's that?
With Mariko.

422
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:53,533
His name is Noburo Mori.

423
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:56,232
Minister of Justice, a rising star.

424
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:57,911
He's Mariko's fiancé.

425
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:00,325
You need to bow.

426
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:08,577
Bow!

427
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,297
Lord Shingen, this is Mr. Logan.

428
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:16,847
I know who he is.

429
00:37:17,753 --> 00:37:19,198
Your father was a good man.

430
00:37:20,923 --> 00:37:23,300
He would often say
the same about you.

431
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:27,744
But then, he was always
fascinated with your kind.

432
00:37:29,974 --> 00:37:33,953
Tell me, why do you think he sent
our little Yukio to fetch you?

433
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:37,606
To say goodbye.

434
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:40,796
And now you have.

435
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:44,379
Time for you to go back to your cave.

436
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,399
Anyone else you want me to meet?

437
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,249
I pledge to you,

438
00:38:24,987 --> 00:38:26,020
Master Yashida,

439
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,995
to be vigilant,

440
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,785
to protect Mariko,

441
00:38:31,952 --> 00:38:33,352
and dedicate my life to.

442
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:42,171
That armor belonged
to Shiruba-Samurai

443
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:43,809
the Silver Samurai.

444
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:47,545
It will stand watch over
the old man forever.

445
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:06,100
Logan?

446
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:13,958
Hey.
Something's not right.

447
00:39:15,955 --> 00:39:16,820
Let go.

448
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:18,585
Can you come here!

449
00:39:19,968 --> 00:39:20,840
Come here!

450
00:39:21,994 --> 00:39:22,841
Step back!

451
00:39:23,568 --> 00:39:24,481
Do it!

452
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:25,892
Step back!

453
00:39:27,424 --> 00:39:28,376
Do it!

454
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:32,631
Step back!

455
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:45,440
Logan!

456
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,005
Logan!

457
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:56,482
Let me go.

458
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:17,480
Logan!

459
00:40:39,934 --> 00:40:41,592
Don't take a video!

460
00:40:41,788 --> 00:40:43,081
Stop that!

461
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:35,429
Smart foreigner!

462
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:37,215
Please take her!

463
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:38,650
Let's go!

464
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:40,836
Move!
Do you think you can escape!

465
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:41,462
Go!

466
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:58,901
Kuzuri.

467
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:02,762
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

468
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:17,608
Yukio!
Mariko!

469
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,414
Where are you going?

470
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:21,136
Go!

471
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:08,304
Mariko!

472
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:09,497
Don't run away!

473
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,910
Wait!

474
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:11,808
Let's go!

475
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:13,399
Here we go!

476
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:02,449
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

477
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:19,319
Wait!

478
00:44:40,146 --> 00:44:41,350
What are you doing!

479
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:43,813
Here, here! Here!

480
00:44:58,171 --> 00:44:59,339
Move!

481
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:01,608
In here! Move!

482
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:05,110
I'll kill you, Gaijin!

483
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,232
No escape!

484
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:19,461
Keep moving, keep moving.

485
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:21,523
Keep moving! Move!

486
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,562
You're bleeding.
You need help.

487
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,614
Just keep moving.

488
00:45:43,524 --> 00:45:45,310
Thank you for what you did back there.

489
00:45:45,385 --> 00:45:46,970
Those were Yakuza.
I'm fine.

490
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:48,481
Why are they after you?

491
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:49,881
I'm fine.

492
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,681
I can make my way from here.

493
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:52,562
You should go.

494
00:45:52,759 --> 00:45:54,014
Get yourself a doctor.

495
00:46:47,113 --> 00:46:48,114
That's nice.

496
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:52,366
This is one of those bullet trains, right?

497
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:54,663
I told you I don't need your help.

498
00:46:55,997 --> 00:46:58,118
So what do they do,
ike 300 miles an hour?

499
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:08,216
Excuse me.
Would you say something!

500
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:10,011
This cowardly attack was,

501
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:12,138
the work of Yakuza thugs.

502
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:14,184
It's a violent response to my efforts,

503
00:47:14,659 --> 00:47:16,342
to try to destroy me,

504
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:17,600
but I will continue to fight

505
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,673
and put down the organized crime.

506
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:24,847
According to witnesses,
she escaped by the north gate.

507
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:27,627
The foreigner was with her.

508
00:47:34,703 --> 00:47:35,809
Your gaijin friend,

509
00:47:36,163 --> 00:47:37,130
where is he?

510
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:39,666
Last I saw he was
protecting your daughter.

511
00:47:42,002 --> 00:47:43,440
You are a toy doll.

512
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,604
A companion for a child
who has outgrown you.

513
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:48,711
Keep that in mind.

514
00:47:49,827 --> 00:47:50,436
Kayo.

515
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,946
Are you ok?

516
00:48:01,521 --> 00:48:03,155
So, where are we headed, Mariko?

517
00:48:08,528 --> 00:48:09,613
Where are we going?

518
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:12,939
I'm going to the end of the line.

519
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:15,693
My family has a home in the South.

520
00:48:16,536 --> 00:48:17,539
That's stupid.

521
00:48:18,538 --> 00:48:21,292
No offense, but they're gonna know
to look for you there.

522
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:22,950
Not this place.

523
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:25,992
But you want to be left alone.
Yes.

524
00:48:25,994 --> 00:48:27,145
I understand.
Do you?

525
00:48:27,147 --> 00:48:28,571
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

526
00:48:28,882 --> 00:48:30,125
Problem is, if I do that,

527
00:48:30,133 --> 00:48:32,218
I don't think you're gonna live
to see the end of the day.

528
00:48:35,805 --> 00:48:39,428
You can't pretend shit isn't
happening when it is, princess.

529
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:42,817
Unless you want to die.
In that case, you're playing this perfectly.

530
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:08,639
What the hell?

531
00:49:30,193 --> 00:49:31,660
What the hell is happening?

532
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:37,763
The foreigner.

533
00:49:42,415 --> 00:49:43,456
The foreigner.

534
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,479
Just do it!

535
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:21,308
What happened to you?

536
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:22,631
We get off here.
Let's go.

537
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:26,019
Just listen to me, will you?
We need to find some place safe.

538
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:27,535
I don't understand.

539
00:52:27,816 --> 00:52:28,997
How do you know
they were Yakuza?

540
00:52:29,038 --> 00:52:30,624
They were the same guys
from the temple.

541
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,171
How do you know they were after me?

542
00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:33,556
Look, we need to find some place safe.

543
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,643
We need to get off the streets.

544
00:52:34,645 --> 00:52:36,289
I don't understand.
Shut up! Listen.

545
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:38,480
Do you know this place?
Where's downtown?

546
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:40,156
Straight ahead.

547
00:52:50,226 --> 00:52:52,049
So, where's the nice part of town?

548
00:52:52,395 --> 00:52:53,939
Another eight blocks that way.

549
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:54,703
Good.

550
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:55,986
We're staying here.

551
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:57,249
Let's go.

552
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,677
This is a love hotel.

553
00:53:04,972 --> 00:53:05,767
A what?

554
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:07,902
A love hotel.

555
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:10,739
For couples,

556
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:12,082
understand?

557
00:53:13,038 --> 00:53:13,949
Right.

558
00:53:15,376 --> 00:53:16,139
Hey.

559
00:53:16,753 --> 00:53:17,789
Two rooms.

560
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:20,218
Adjoining rooms, on the same floor.

561
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,350
I can not speak English

562
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:22,983
Right next to each other.
I can not speak English

563
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:23,998
Very close No.

564
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:25,914
Same floor. Same floor.
No English. No English.

565
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:28,730
No English. English.
No. No. No. No.

566
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:31,038
I want to ask you two rooms,

567
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,472
Is it next to each other?

568
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,457
It's crowded now.

569
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,178
Now empty room.

570
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,391
Underground cell.

571
00:53:41,048 --> 00:53:42,168
Nurse's room.

572
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,774
Mars expedition.

573
00:53:45,073 --> 00:53:46,067
What did she say?

574
00:53:47,116 --> 00:53:49,643
She has no rooms available
next to each other.

575
00:53:50,453 --> 00:53:52,230
She's asking if we prefer,

576
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:53,176
the dungeon,

577
00:53:53,816 --> 00:53:55,181
the nurse's office

578
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,501
or the mission to Mars.

579
00:54:14,938 --> 00:54:15,875
This'll do.

580
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:22,527
<i>Lift off! We have a lift off!</i>

581
00:54:22,694 --> 00:54:24,269
Kind of homey, actually.

582
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:33,871
Where do you plan on sleeping?

583
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:37,546
I don't.

584
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:14,328
That's a lot of blood.

585
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:19,028
I thought you were done being the hero.

586
00:55:20,543 --> 00:55:21,867
But these guys were...

587
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:23,784
trying to kill her.

588
00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:27,598
Just let it go.

589
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:31,246
It's not hard to die.

590
00:55:34,265 --> 00:55:35,480
Come to me.

591
00:56:02,063 --> 00:56:03,064
Logan

592
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:06,339
You're slipping.

593
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,193
You hide but you can't escape.

594
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,591
What are you?

595
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,495
Kill him!

596
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:25,708
Do it!

597
00:56:28,736 --> 00:56:29,737
Logan

598
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,840
Look at him!

599
00:56:37,846 --> 00:56:38,889
Wanna say something,

600
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,442
What?　What happened?

601
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:47,180
Who?

602
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,249
He was killed.

603
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,330
I'm talking because I'm worried.

604
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,330
I'll do it later.

605
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,681
No worries. No.

606
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,000
I'll do it.
I'm worried.

607
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,074
He woke up.

608
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,496
This is Mieko,

609
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:12,440
from the hotel
and her grandson, Hitoshi.

610
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,013
Is he a doctor?

611
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,687
In a manner of speaking, yes.

612
00:58:17,637 --> 00:58:19,045
He's a veterinarian

613
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:21,695
student.

614
00:58:23,184 --> 00:58:24,323
Large animal.

615
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,477
Thanks.

616
00:58:34,362 --> 00:58:37,980
You may have cut him once or twice
while he was stitching you.

617
00:58:38,658 --> 00:58:39,830
Ok, ok.

618
00:58:40,612 --> 00:58:42,099
Ok. Ok. Ok.

619
00:58:42,163 --> 00:58:43,920
I'll take care of it.

620
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,392
Please take a break.

621
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,701
I understand.

622
00:58:51,037 --> 00:58:51,629
Hey.

623
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:54,741
Thank you.

624
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,127
I never needed this before.

625
00:59:03,057 --> 00:59:04,806
What? Help?

626
00:59:10,398 --> 00:59:11,503
That doctor, the...

627
00:59:12,118 --> 00:59:14,436
one who helped your
grandfather, the blonde.

628
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:15,343
Who is she?

629
00:59:15,404 --> 00:59:18,644
He met her last year when
he was in America for treatment.

630
00:59:19,865 --> 00:59:22,863
Your grandfather told me my
healing could be taken from me,

631
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:24,230
passed on.

632
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:28,038
I'm not getting better, not like before.

633
00:59:29,959 --> 00:59:31,445
She did this to me.

634
00:59:42,888 --> 00:59:43,651
Blondie!

635
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,150
Miss Blonde, wait a minute.

636
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:47,339
Blondie! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

637
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:48,746
Look here.

638
00:59:49,634 --> 00:59:50,664
How beautiful!

639
00:59:50,896 --> 00:59:51,697
How much?

640
00:59:51,997 --> 00:59:53,942
How much, yeah?
How much...

641
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,756
You kept me waiting two hours.

642
01:00:16,377 --> 01:00:17,559
You have no respect.

643
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:19,289
So you haven't found them?

644
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,179
Don't play with me, bitch.
I could kill you.

645
01:00:25,514 --> 01:00:27,686
If you could make me
feel something, Harada,

646
01:00:28,194 --> 01:00:29,516
that would be sublime.

647
01:00:29,636 --> 01:00:31,270
I can slit your pretty mouth open,

648
01:00:31,272 --> 01:00:33,358
before you open it
to say one more stupid.

649
01:00:37,777 --> 01:00:40,546
I asked you to do one thing, little man.

650
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,615
Bring me the mutant.

651
01:00:42,782 --> 01:00:44,166
I don't work for you.

652
01:00:44,371 --> 01:00:45,613
I work for the House of...

653
01:00:48,171 --> 01:00:49,711
You work for Yashida,

654
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,208
I get it.

655
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,505
Yet you cannot fulfill his dying wish.

656
01:00:56,295 --> 01:00:59,474
My God, if you had any idea
how much you have failed him.

657
01:00:59,964 --> 01:01:01,031
Where is Logan?

658
01:01:01,431 --> 01:01:03,142
I am not done with him.

659
01:01:08,974 --> 01:01:10,709
The mutant has powers.

660
01:01:12,353 --> 01:01:14,199
He's just a man now.

661
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:16,609
His flesh is weak now.

662
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:18,150
I did that.

663
01:01:18,192 --> 01:01:20,820
I suppressed his power
so he could be taken.

664
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,964
You see, it's me you should respect.

665
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,973
Just find them,

666
01:01:28,975 --> 01:01:30,401
before the Yakuza.

667
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:00,037
We get off here.

668
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:21,318
Where are we?

669
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,434
Just outside Nagasaki.

670
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:34,804
This way.

671
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:55,706
This is the guy from the funeral,
the archer.

672
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:58,375
He was your boyfriend.

673
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:00,298
That's Harada.

674
01:03:02,674 --> 01:03:04,640
We were village champions
that summer.

675
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:06,702
He with the bow

676
01:03:07,195 --> 01:03:09,322
and me with the knives.

677
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:17,501
Harada and I were planning
to get married.

678
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:18,710
What stopped you?

679
01:03:19,647 --> 01:03:20,758
Grandfather.

680
01:03:21,106 --> 01:03:23,776
He said we had to wait until
we were at least 15.

681
01:03:31,283 --> 01:03:32,618
From the mountain,

682
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,238
from the sea.

683
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:36,630
I will take it!

684
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,023
I will take it!

685
01:03:46,298 --> 01:03:48,824
Chopsticks upright are a bad omen.

686
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:52,175
It resembles incense at a funeral.

687
01:03:55,683 --> 01:03:57,258
Nothing is without meaning.

688
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,869
So, the other night at the house,
when you...

689
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:04,841
ran out in the rain
what did that mean?

690
01:04:07,653 --> 01:04:09,087
My grandfather was dying.

691
01:04:10,656 --> 01:04:12,006
You knew he was gonna die.

692
01:04:12,585 --> 01:04:13,711
He'd been sick for a long time.

693
01:04:13,784 --> 01:04:15,376
It wasn't his death I feared.

694
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:17,841
So what then?

695
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:22,459
What did he tell you that night?

696
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,347
Mariko, why did your father hit you?

697
01:04:29,842 --> 01:04:31,385
I was trying to warn him.

698
01:04:31,552 --> 01:04:32,447
About what?

699
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,479
What did your grandfather tell you?

700
01:04:39,143 --> 01:04:40,073
He told me...

701
01:04:41,162 --> 01:04:41,940
that...

702
01:04:44,023 --> 01:04:45,158
in three days,

703
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:48,660
when they read his will...

704
01:04:51,238 --> 01:04:54,358
I will become the most
powerful person in Japan.

705
01:04:58,412 --> 01:04:59,851
He gave it all to me.

706
01:05:01,784 --> 01:05:02,699
The company?

707
01:05:07,212 --> 01:05:08,457
I didn't want it.

708
01:05:11,342 --> 01:05:12,268
He knew that.

709
01:05:14,595 --> 01:05:16,775
I don't understand
why he gave it to me.

710
01:05:17,848 --> 01:05:19,652
It was all my father dreamed of.

711
01:05:21,226 --> 01:05:22,436
Well, that's why.

712
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:29,735
What about this fiancé of yours?
Nostromo.

713
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:31,579
Noburo.

714
01:05:32,071 --> 01:05:33,417
Does he know about this?

715
01:05:33,843 --> 01:05:34,542
No.

716
01:05:36,617 --> 01:05:37,822
Why are you marrying him?

717
01:05:38,786 --> 01:05:40,490
He seems like kind of an asshole.

718
01:05:42,748 --> 01:05:44,784
My father arranged it last year.

719
01:05:45,584 --> 01:05:46,343
What?

720
01:05:46,345 --> 01:05:48,743
It gives him a better access
to the political theater.

721
01:05:53,425 --> 01:05:56,073
To disobey my father
would be to dishonor him.

722
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,318
I don't expect you to understand.

723
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,033
You're not Japanese.

724
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:16,847
Can't find my daughter yet?

725
01:06:17,609 --> 01:06:19,699
Our island is long and thin.
Trains only run in two directions.

726
01:06:19,824 --> 01:06:21,638
You've only to go up and down.

727
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:23,791
Lord Shingen, please don't worry.

728
01:06:24,072 --> 01:06:26,472
My men are working hard
and give their best...

729
01:06:26,474 --> 01:06:28,081
Then they're just idiots.

730
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,810
You've wasted to much my time.

731
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,584
I have my father's affairs to deal.

732
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,928
Get out and find her!

733
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:38,071
Go!

734
01:06:42,801 --> 01:06:45,908
Tell me you have more promising
news from your contacts.

735
01:06:46,937 --> 01:06:48,648
They open the will in three days.

736
01:06:49,398 --> 01:06:50,730
We are running out of time.

737
01:06:52,484 --> 01:06:54,653
Soon, I hope.

738
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:56,989
I'm sending men to the South.

739
01:06:57,156 --> 01:06:58,639
That's where we found the bodies.

740
01:07:10,169 --> 01:07:11,962
<i>The fact, the Yakuza was at the funeral,</i>

741
01:07:11,964 --> 01:07:13,299
<i>it means they had someone inside.</i>

742
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,230
Alright, they can't find me here.

743
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,827
It's dangerous.

744
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,820
I'm coming there right now.

745
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,521
<i>No.</i>
They'll follow you.

746
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:25,100
Don't worry.

747
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:25,964
Please.

748
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,896
Only next few days.

749
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:29,115
I'm fine.

750
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:30,908
Logan is here.

751
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:32,741
But he is hurt.

752
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:34,624
Mariko-chan?

753
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:36,125
Someone's here.

754
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:36,949
Mariko?

755
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,083
I've to go.
<i>Hello?</i>

756
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,105
Mariko?

757
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,391
Mariko-chan?

758
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,537
What happen Grandma?

759
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,582
Mariko-chan,
a big tree fell on the road.

760
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,711
The boys tried to get away,
but it was hard to get out

761
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:53,472
Uncle, please drink tea

762
01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:56,611
Thank you for your hard work,
please be careful

763
01:08:20,989 --> 01:08:22,047
Are you ok?

764
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,371
Tired.

765
01:08:27,955 --> 01:08:28,947
Do you need something?

766
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:32,678
No.

767
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,560
Hello.
Hello.

768
01:08:37,574 --> 01:08:40,301
Apple?
Apple? Have.

769
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:42,821
This will help.

770
01:09:34,688 --> 01:09:35,622
It's time.

771
01:09:39,234 --> 01:09:40,235
What?

772
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:41,997
Please.

773
01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:43,771
Take it.

774
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:46,381
Thank you.

775
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,018
No.

776
01:10:08,347 --> 01:10:09,221
Two hands.

777
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:11,624
Japanese sword...

778
01:10:12,258 --> 01:10:13,558
require two hands.

779
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:20,479
Like that?
That's it.

780
01:10:23,779 --> 01:10:25,094
It's beautiful, Yashida.

781
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:29,868
But I can't take it.

782
01:10:30,369 --> 01:10:31,278
Please.

783
01:10:32,746 --> 01:10:33,588
Thank you.

784
01:10:40,462 --> 01:10:41,630
Keep it safe.

785
01:10:44,549 --> 01:10:45,754
Keep it safe for me.

786
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:50,320
Someday, I'll come get it.

787
01:10:59,272 --> 01:11:00,078
It's time.

788
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:48,925
I was here,

789
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,864
when it happened.

790
01:11:53,952 --> 01:11:55,446
It's how I met your grandfather.

791
01:11:56,705 --> 01:11:57,810
We hid in there.

792
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:01,802
I heard the stories.

793
01:12:06,506 --> 01:12:08,133
My grandfather would say,

794
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,582
what happened here was proof that
everything in the world finds peace.

795
01:12:16,183 --> 01:12:17,382
Eventually.

796
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:24,577
That man can recover from anything.

797
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,257
Maybe you, too.

798
01:12:37,371 --> 01:12:38,940
You don't sleep very well.

799
01:12:39,831 --> 01:12:41,282
You call out in the night.

800
01:12:48,423 --> 01:12:49,435
Who's Jean?

801
01:13:04,731 --> 01:13:06,107
We should go back.

802
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,010
There's rain coming.

803
01:13:28,213 --> 01:13:29,476
I'll make tea.

804
01:13:37,889 --> 01:13:39,054
For you.

805
01:14:15,176 --> 01:14:16,576
This isn't right.

806
01:14:30,317 --> 01:14:33,209
You need this tied like a proper samurai.

807
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:39,383
Your grandfather called me a ronin.

808
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:42,806
A samurai without a master.

809
01:14:45,373 --> 01:14:47,685
He said I was destined to live forever,

810
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:51,394
with no reason to live.

811
01:14:57,052 --> 01:14:58,211
Was he right?

812
01:14:59,846 --> 01:15:00,576
Yes.

813
01:15:06,353 --> 01:15:07,198
Still?

814
01:15:57,278 --> 01:15:58,279
Hey.

815
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,448
What are you doing?

816
01:16:05,412 --> 01:16:07,054
This isn't going to end well.

817
01:16:12,293 --> 01:16:14,295
Everyone you love dies.

818
01:16:34,983 --> 01:16:35,972
Kuzuri.

819
01:16:39,112 --> 01:16:40,476
Do you know what that means?

820
01:16:45,452 --> 01:16:46,395
An animal.

821
01:16:47,454 --> 01:16:48,950
A fierce creature,

822
01:16:49,734 --> 01:16:52,418
with long claws and sharp teeth.

823
01:16:54,794 --> 01:16:56,341
It fears nothing.

824
01:16:58,631 --> 01:16:59,853
When I was a girl,

825
01:17:00,633 --> 01:17:02,323
I had nightmares.

826
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:05,537
I'd wake up and run to my parents.

827
01:17:06,681 --> 01:17:08,405
My father would get angry.

828
01:17:13,813 --> 01:17:16,038
Go back to sleep.
Face your fears.

829
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:20,137
My grandfather was different.

830
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:23,785
He told me stories about Kuzuri,

831
01:17:24,326 --> 01:17:25,263
his friend.

832
01:17:26,493 --> 01:17:28,518
Who he met at the bottom of a well.

833
01:17:31,664 --> 01:17:33,759
He said the Kuzuri was magical,

834
01:17:34,655 --> 01:17:36,095
and saved his life.

835
01:17:38,505 --> 01:17:40,852
He said Kuzuri
would protect me, too,

836
01:17:41,947 --> 01:17:43,567
as I slept in my bed.

837
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:54,205
Who's Jean?

838
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:03,422
Is she like you?

839
01:18:06,533 --> 01:18:07,623
What happened to her?

840
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:10,829
She died.

841
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:19,444
I killed her.

842
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:28,326
Along with the Kuzuri.

843
01:19:10,263 --> 01:19:11,174
Logan.

844
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:26,757
Mariko?

845
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:31,117
Logan!

846
01:19:31,993 --> 01:19:33,286
Logan!

847
01:19:34,808 --> 01:19:35,892
Mariko?

848
01:19:36,623 --> 01:19:37,505
Mariko!

849
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:40,095
No! Logan!

850
01:19:46,299 --> 01:19:47,169
No!

851
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:49,988
Logan!
Hurry up!

852
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:50,976
No!

853
01:20:03,211 --> 01:20:03,961
Mariko!

854
01:20:04,546 --> 01:20:05,156
Logan!

855
01:20:05,578 --> 01:20:06,109
Logan!

856
01:20:07,695 --> 01:20:08,950
Logan! No!

857
01:20:10,323 --> 01:20:11,135
No!

858
01:20:13,826 --> 01:20:14,567
Logan!

859
01:20:16,535 --> 01:20:17,664
Mariko! Mariko!

860
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:18,632
Logan!

861
01:20:39,769 --> 01:20:41,020
Where are they taking her?

862
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:42,617
Where are they taking her?

863
01:20:43,064 --> 01:20:44,524
Where, you piece of shit?

864
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:48,419
I no talk, gaijin.

865
01:20:49,696 --> 01:20:51,213
I never talk.

866
01:20:58,037 --> 01:20:59,217
Who hired you?

867
01:21:23,396 --> 01:21:24,712
Take me to Noburo.

868
01:21:25,898 --> 01:21:27,734
Logan.
Take me to him.

869
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:29,902
I need to tell you something.

870
01:21:30,069 --> 01:21:31,828
Do it. Now.

871
01:21:51,257 --> 01:21:52,580
You wait in the car.

872
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:54,929
Logan.
What?

873
01:21:56,512 --> 01:21:57,782
I saw you die.

874
01:21:58,598 --> 01:21:59,269
What?

875
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,797
I saw you die.

876
01:22:02,769 --> 01:22:04,188
When? Just now?

877
01:22:05,229 --> 01:22:06,283
A while ago.

878
01:22:07,307 --> 01:22:09,253
But it's not like
I get a complete picture.

879
01:22:10,151 --> 01:22:12,092
More like looking through a keyhole.

880
01:22:13,988 --> 01:22:15,557
But I'm always right.

881
01:22:17,116 --> 01:22:20,259
All I can see is one part
of a person's life,

882
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:22,044
their death.

883
01:22:23,331 --> 01:22:24,845
And I saw yours.

884
01:22:28,753 --> 01:22:29,957
So, what did you see?

885
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:32,620
I see you on your back.

886
01:22:33,278 --> 01:22:34,773
There's blood everywhere.

887
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:39,757
You're holding your
own heart in your hand.

888
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,040
It's not beating.

889
01:22:45,599 --> 01:22:46,927
I don't have time for this shit.

890
01:22:47,021 --> 01:22:48,161
When I was five,

891
01:22:48,874 --> 01:22:51,123
I knew how my own
parents would die.

892
01:22:53,194 --> 01:22:55,987
Then I watched it happen
from the back seat.

893
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,575
Look at me.

894
01:23:03,955 --> 01:23:06,426
A lot of people have tried to kill me,
and I'm still here.

895
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:07,841
Yeah

896
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,871
but you're different now, aren't you?

897
01:23:12,213 --> 01:23:13,531
They can hurt you.

898
01:23:14,298 --> 01:23:15,451
They can kill you.

899
01:23:16,467 --> 01:23:17,887
Just wait in the car.

900
01:23:29,313 --> 01:23:31,315
I said, wait in the car.
You need backup.

901
01:23:31,482 --> 01:23:33,359
You're not safe, not in your condition.

902
01:23:35,361 --> 01:23:37,210
Just think of me as your bodyguard.

903
01:23:47,901 --> 01:23:49,011
<i>Sexy.</i>

904
01:23:55,751 --> 01:23:57,711
Come on!
I'm coming.

905
01:23:57,770 --> 01:23:58,842
Wait a minute

906
01:24:05,975 --> 01:24:08,649
Ok, round four.
Here we go.

907
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:12,591
It's a nice butt.

908
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:23,576
Drink for you, my lady.

909
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:32,475
Get out.

910
01:24:38,436 --> 01:24:39,520
Not you.

911
01:24:42,093 --> 01:24:43,465
Now call me old-fashioned

912
01:24:43,467 --> 01:24:44,805
but I thought being engaged meant

913
01:24:44,807 --> 01:24:46,233
you were done with this kind of bullshit.

914
01:24:46,265 --> 01:24:47,642
I am the Minister of Justice.

915
01:24:47,644 --> 01:24:49,183
Do you have any idea
what I could do to you?

916
01:24:49,185 --> 01:24:51,143
Really?
You're gonna try and talk tough,

917
01:24:51,145 --> 01:24:52,684
standing there in your red underwear?

918
01:24:53,517 --> 01:24:54,601
You have ten words,

919
01:24:54,774 --> 01:24:56,707
ten words...

920
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:58,427
to explain to me,

921
01:24:58,648 --> 01:25:01,403
why you, the Minister of Justice

922
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:04,403
would want your fiancé
killed by the Yakuza.

923
01:25:04,472 --> 01:25:06,301
And if I don't like what you say,

924
01:25:06,303 --> 01:25:08,931
you are going through
that fucking window.

925
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:11,916
You don't have the faintest
idea what's going on

926
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:16,532
How many words was that?
Nine.

927
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:17,553
Nine.

928
01:25:18,054 --> 01:25:19,679
You have one word left.

929
01:25:22,468 --> 01:25:23,223
Really?

930
01:25:23,637 --> 01:25:24,656
Really?

931
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:26,722
Shingen. Shingen!

932
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:29,721
Keep going.

933
01:25:32,061 --> 01:25:33,228
Since he got sick,

934
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:37,140
old man Yashida spent billions
on doctors, healers.

935
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:39,833
Stockpiling adamantium
at his lab in the North,

936
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,295
secretly trying to prolong his life.

937
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:45,718
He brought the company
to the edge of bankruptcy.

938
01:25:45,992 --> 01:25:47,522
He was obsessed with you.

939
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:50,454
Tobe's executives are already...

940
01:25:50,972 --> 01:25:51,744
English!

941
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:53,713
Shingen lied,

942
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:55,409
protected the old man,

943
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:58,193
concealed the debt from
stockholders and the board.

944
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,507
He tried to be a good son
and thought he'd be rewarded.

945
01:26:02,591 --> 01:26:04,976
And then the old man left
everything to his granddaughter.

946
01:26:04,978 --> 01:26:07,523
If Mariko got all that power,
she would dump his ass.

947
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:08,465
It's true.

948
01:26:08,723 --> 01:26:11,485
Mariko would have never gone
through with the wedding,

949
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:13,706
not once the will was revealed.

950
01:26:15,229 --> 01:26:16,355
She never took to me.

951
01:26:16,772 --> 01:26:17,800
Oh, really?

952
01:26:18,118 --> 01:26:19,542
A class act like you.

953
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:22,793
Shingen promised me
a fortune for my help.

954
01:26:24,113 --> 01:26:26,542
So, you put a hit on his daughter.

955
01:26:26,809 --> 01:26:27,966
Is that it?

956
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:30,786
Political careers don't last forever.

957
01:26:31,579 --> 01:26:32,455
That's right.

958
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:34,623
Wait! Wait! No!

959
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,909
You wanted the truth.
I told you the truth!

960
01:26:38,461 --> 01:26:39,569
I didn't like it.

961
01:26:44,133 --> 01:26:45,628
How did you know
there is a pool down there?

962
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:46,656
I didn't.

963
01:26:57,666 --> 01:26:58,512
Thank you.

964
01:27:03,402 --> 01:27:04,661
Did you know,

965
01:27:04,952 --> 01:27:07,555
that I studied biology at university.

966
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:10,485
Genetics.

967
01:27:15,122 --> 01:27:17,583
There are genes that skip generations.

968
01:27:18,084 --> 01:27:19,383
Recessive genes.

969
01:27:22,673 --> 01:27:23,424
Eyes.

970
01:27:23,464 --> 01:27:24,405
Hair.

971
01:27:25,966 --> 01:27:27,132
Talent.

972
01:27:28,614 --> 01:27:29,658
Temperament.

973
01:27:32,223 --> 01:27:35,040
Not all children can inherit equally.

974
01:27:35,908 --> 01:27:38,077
My father is not inside me.

975
01:27:39,563 --> 01:27:40,802
But inside you.

976
01:27:41,482 --> 01:27:43,624
He faced a mirror.
I was finding myself

977
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:06,337
How can you control
the Asia's largest company?

978
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:08,156
I persuaded my father.

979
01:28:08,263 --> 01:28:09,124
Crazy.

980
01:28:09,799 --> 01:28:10,315
No.

981
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:12,936
Just woke up.

982
01:28:15,182 --> 01:28:17,190
If you kill me father,

983
01:28:17,192 --> 01:28:18,853
you'll lose all honor you have left.

984
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:20,595
Stop.

985
01:28:22,512 --> 01:28:23,774
Don't worry Mariko.

986
01:28:23,896 --> 01:28:26,448
I don't want to hurt you.
I want to protect you.

987
01:28:26,777 --> 01:28:27,903
I'll stop your pain.
Let me go.

988
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,713
I will fulfill your wishes.

989
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,456
Things I couldn't do that day
that were disturbed by the monster.

990
01:28:32,552 --> 01:28:34,370
I didn't want to die.

991
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,372
Let me go.

992
01:28:52,548 --> 01:28:54,140
It's alright, Mariko.

993
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,877
Come with me.
What's going on?

994
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:03,627
It's more than you can imagine,

995
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:12,416
You.

996
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:14,506
Me.

997
01:29:15,409 --> 01:29:18,815
Sorry to interrupt,
but I need your daughter alive.

998
01:29:19,288 --> 01:29:20,227
What are you?

999
01:29:21,457 --> 01:29:22,553
A chemist,

1000
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,010
a nihilist,

1001
01:29:24,293 --> 01:29:25,387
a capitalist,

1002
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:27,388
a mutation.

1003
01:29:31,342 --> 01:29:32,274
A viper.

1004
01:30:03,082 --> 01:30:04,342
Where is the security?

1005
01:30:24,937 --> 01:30:25,938
Yakuza.

1006
01:30:28,409 --> 01:30:29,213
Shingen?

1007
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:51,048
Logan.

1008
01:31:01,943 --> 01:31:02,748
This.

1009
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:04,838
This here.
Where is this?

1010
01:31:08,689 --> 01:31:10,320
Master Yashida's birthplace.

1011
01:31:11,692 --> 01:31:14,221
The company built a facility
into the mountainside.

1012
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,311
How far?

1013
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:21,830
500 kilometers from here.

1014
01:32:29,473 --> 01:32:31,113
I got to get that thing out of me.

1015
01:32:32,569 --> 01:32:33,209
How?

1016
01:32:34,169 --> 01:32:34,983
Stop Logan.

1017
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,337
I saw you die.

1018
01:32:36,882 --> 01:32:38,020
I'm never wrong.

1019
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,635
I'm never wrong.

1020
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:40,487
You're not always right.

1021
01:32:40,489 --> 01:32:41,936
You didn't know the old man
was gonna bite it.

1022
01:32:42,006 --> 01:32:43,949
I saw you die in a room like this
with your heart in your hand.

1023
01:32:43,951 --> 01:32:45,971
I can't leave her
with those freaks and killers.

1024
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:49,432
I'm the only chance she's got,
but not with that thing inside me.

1025
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:50,853
You're going to die, Logan.

1026
01:32:50,902 --> 01:32:52,126
Maybe that's ok.

1027
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:54,278
No, listen to me, Logan!

1028
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,737
No, stop.

1029
01:32:56,274 --> 01:32:57,154
Logan!

1030
01:32:58,001 --> 01:32:59,377
You're not gonna want
to watch this part.

1031
01:32:59,379 --> 01:33:01,430
No! Listen to me!
Please, no!

1032
01:33:02,945 --> 01:33:03,695
No, stop.

1033
01:33:04,134 --> 01:33:05,106
Listen to me.

1034
01:33:06,468 --> 01:33:07,349
Logan!

1035
01:33:16,322 --> 01:33:17,304
Move!

1036
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:18,543
Stay away from him.

1037
01:33:20,237 --> 01:33:21,703
He killed your master.

1038
01:33:22,698 --> 01:33:24,509
Put hands on your sister.

1039
01:33:25,701 --> 01:33:27,025
And now you want him?

1040
01:33:30,289 --> 01:33:31,077
Oh, no.

1041
01:33:31,548 --> 01:33:32,480
I can't see.

1042
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:34,960
You'll always be a beggar.

1043
01:33:35,127 --> 01:33:36,044
You're crazy.

1044
01:33:44,386 --> 01:33:45,429
Oh, no.

1045
01:34:16,736 --> 01:34:17,473
Yukio.

1046
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:38,300
Logan!

1047
01:34:45,614 --> 01:34:46,440
Logan!

1048
01:34:46,938 --> 01:34:47,772
Logan!

1049
01:34:48,659 --> 01:34:49,471
Logan!

1050
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:34,121
Don't hit my friends.

1051
01:35:37,207 --> 01:35:38,292
Where's Mariko?

1052
01:35:38,377 --> 01:35:39,267
She's gone.

1053
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:41,219
That Viper bitch took her.

1054
01:35:41,461 --> 01:35:43,351
It was my father's obsession,

1055
01:35:44,506 --> 01:35:45,753
with mutation,

1056
01:35:46,278 --> 01:35:47,741
with God's mistakes,

1057
01:35:48,802 --> 01:35:50,446
like you and her,

1058
01:35:51,275 --> 01:35:52,882
that ruined this house.

1059
01:37:05,962 --> 01:37:07,449
You tried to kill your daughter.

1060
01:37:10,225 --> 01:37:11,522
Live with that.

1061
01:37:26,942 --> 01:37:29,253
What kind of monster are you?

1062
01:37:30,612 --> 01:37:31,814
The Wolverine.

1063
01:37:45,502 --> 01:37:46,975
Hey, come here, come here.

1064
01:37:46,977 --> 01:37:48,210
That's it.

1065
01:37:49,214 --> 01:37:50,421
I was wrong.

1066
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:51,801
I told you.

1067
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:53,764
Let me have a look at you.

1068
01:37:55,053 --> 01:37:56,325
It's nothing.

1069
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:57,090
Hey,

1070
01:37:58,176 --> 01:37:59,154
thank you.

1071
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:12,942
It's a trap, Logan.

1072
01:38:32,962 --> 01:38:34,447
What is this here?

1073
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:36,839
What are you hiding?

1074
01:38:37,132 --> 01:38:38,654
It's easy to understand, Mariko.

1075
01:38:41,057 --> 01:38:42,464
Welcome, Mariko.

1076
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,563
It's alright, Mariko.

1077
01:38:45,938 --> 01:38:47,556
She also serves
the House of Yashida.

1078
01:38:47,736 --> 01:38:49,154
She serves herself.

1079
01:38:49,383 --> 01:38:50,782
She infected Logan.

1080
01:38:53,278 --> 01:38:54,665
And what about Grandfather?

1081
01:38:55,479 --> 01:38:57,148
What did you infect him with?

1082
01:38:59,868 --> 01:39:01,744
I granted his dying wish.

1083
01:39:02,871 --> 01:39:04,237
I helped him to rest.

1084
01:39:07,167 --> 01:39:08,876
Now, it's your turn.

1085
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:18,988
Lend a hand?

1086
01:39:43,203 --> 01:39:44,315
Listen to me, mutant.

1087
01:39:44,664 --> 01:39:45,998
She will not be harmed.

1088
01:39:47,457 --> 01:39:48,867
She will be fine.

1089
01:39:50,299 --> 01:39:52,159
So long as you do your job.

1090
01:39:53,582 --> 01:39:55,942
Logan will be here soon,
you should prepare.

1091
01:39:56,716 --> 01:39:58,567
It was easy to lure him here.

1092
01:39:59,246 --> 01:40:00,885
It's another thing to capture him.

1093
01:40:00,887 --> 01:40:01,780
We're ready.

1094
01:40:01,782 --> 01:40:03,465
He's never faced the Black Clan.

1095
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:07,979
Yes, well...

1096
01:40:10,114 --> 01:40:11,901
Dip your arrows in this.

1097
01:40:12,774 --> 01:40:14,257
It won't kill him,

1098
01:40:15,151 --> 01:40:16,789
but it will slow him down.

1099
01:40:17,317 --> 01:40:18,444
Keep your potions.

1100
01:40:18,613 --> 01:40:21,032
He's no challenge for us now.
He's weak.

1101
01:40:21,908 --> 01:40:22,823
Ok.

1102
01:40:26,218 --> 01:40:27,796
But when you fail...

1103
01:40:29,584 --> 01:40:31,002
you have this.

1104
01:40:48,476 --> 01:40:50,185
Did you have a nice rest?

1105
01:40:57,610 --> 01:40:58,862
I don't know what you said or did

1106
01:40:58,864 --> 01:41:00,345
to deceive Harada or my grandfather

1107
01:41:00,347 --> 01:41:01,431
Now calm down.

1108
01:41:02,032 --> 01:41:03,840
Your grandfather sought me out.

1109
01:41:04,451 --> 01:41:06,202
I am the head of this family now.

1110
01:41:10,498 --> 01:41:12,696
And why do you suppose that is?

1111
01:41:15,081 --> 01:41:17,614
Why do you think the old man chose you?

1112
01:41:21,134 --> 01:41:22,631
Because you are strong?

1113
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:25,572
Or because you are weak?

1114
01:42:21,069 --> 01:42:22,497
I see you've come to fight.

1115
01:42:22,904 --> 01:42:24,072
It's pointless.

1116
01:42:24,153 --> 01:42:26,488
You're weak.
You're out numbered.

1117
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:29,135
The Black Clan has protected
the House of Yashida,

1118
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:30,746
for 700 years.

1119
01:42:32,205 --> 01:42:33,832
Is that all the men you brought?

1120
01:42:37,168 --> 01:42:38,326
I'm gonna get her.

1121
01:42:39,379 --> 01:42:41,381
We are grateful for your
protection of Mariko.

1122
01:42:41,548 --> 01:42:44,576
But there is one more sacrifice
you must make for her family.

1123
01:42:45,927 --> 01:42:47,770
Go fuck yourself, pretty boy.

1124
01:42:56,398 --> 01:42:57,140
Come!

1125
01:43:23,484 --> 01:43:24,652
Markines, let's go!

1126
01:43:24,653 --> 01:43:25,363
Go!

1127
01:45:50,111 --> 01:45:51,465
Yukio, run!

1128
01:47:03,267 --> 01:47:04,272
Logan.

1129
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:38,362
<i>Logan.</i>

1130
01:48:38,488 --> 01:48:39,530
<i>Kayla.</i>

1131
01:48:39,655 --> 01:48:40,823
<i>I love you.
Kayla!</i>

1132
01:48:40,948 --> 01:48:42,180
<i>Logan.</i>

1133
01:48:47,246 --> 01:48:48,706
<i>Logan!
Mariko!</i>

1134
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:51,667
Jean.

1135
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:54,086
<i>Save me.</i>

1136
01:49:25,326 --> 01:49:27,505
Stand back.
There is no need.

1137
01:49:27,537 --> 01:49:29,219
Where is she?
Where's Mariko?

1138
01:49:29,539 --> 01:49:30,540
Where is she?

1139
01:49:31,402 --> 01:49:32,898
Where is Mariko?

1140
01:49:33,793 --> 01:49:35,359
Still pining away?

1141
01:49:36,212 --> 01:49:37,616
That's so sweet.

1142
01:49:39,173 --> 01:49:40,530
Impressive, no?

1143
01:49:41,342 --> 01:49:43,061
He is made of adamantium,

1144
01:49:43,281 --> 01:49:44,771
just like you.

1145
01:49:55,475 --> 01:49:57,435
Oh, Logan, you know what, I get it.

1146
01:49:57,437 --> 01:49:58,902
You're frustrated.

1147
01:49:59,622 --> 01:50:01,817
I know she's here.
I want to see her.

1148
01:50:02,613 --> 01:50:03,984
You want answers.

1149
01:50:04,812 --> 01:50:06,432
Yes, I want answers!
I'm sorry,

1150
01:50:06,434 --> 01:50:08,161
I wish I could say more,

1151
01:50:08,244 --> 01:50:10,253
but I was hired in part
for my discretion.

1152
01:50:10,255 --> 01:50:11,339
I'm sure you were.

1153
01:50:12,331 --> 01:50:13,330
That,

1154
01:50:13,666 --> 01:50:18,477
and a certain talent for combining
biochemistry and metaphysics.

1155
01:50:18,963 --> 01:50:22,085
High-grade toxins are my specialty.

1156
01:50:22,341 --> 01:50:24,552
It helps to be genetically immune

1157
01:50:24,554 --> 01:50:26,932
to every poison known to man, as I am.

1158
01:50:28,014 --> 01:50:31,976
And immune to the toxin
that is man himself

1159
01:50:33,277 --> 01:50:34,417
as I am.

1160
01:50:34,979 --> 01:50:37,363
I'll tell you what,
you twisted mutant bitch,

1161
01:50:38,272 --> 01:50:39,857
why don't you open these bracelets,

1162
01:50:39,859 --> 01:50:41,777
and we'll see who's made of what?

1163
01:50:46,365 --> 01:50:48,641
The claws.
Now we can begin.

1164
01:50:51,496 --> 01:50:54,213
I know you have feelings for him.

1165
01:50:54,415 --> 01:50:55,549
But you must forget him.

1166
01:50:56,083 --> 01:50:58,252
You are a member of Yashida family.

1167
01:50:58,344 --> 01:51:00,304
That woman betrayed Grandfather,

1168
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,173
and so have you.

1169
01:51:02,691 --> 01:51:03,535
No Mariko.

1170
01:51:03,966 --> 01:51:05,801
Are we childhood friends?

1171
01:51:06,093 --> 01:51:07,511
You have to believe me.

1172
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:08,420
Hanada.

1173
01:51:08,422 --> 01:51:10,450
I have to leave, let me to meet him.

1174
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:12,195
Did he do anything to you?

1175
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,909
He saved my life.

1176
01:51:14,015 --> 01:51:15,731
Forget him, Mariko.

1177
01:51:15,950 --> 01:51:17,015
I am not willing to do this.

1178
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:20,408
I obey, I'm following
your Grandfather's plan.

1179
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:22,958
The suppressant bug you found
inside of you was mine.

1180
01:51:23,994 --> 01:51:25,878
You took it out on your own.

1181
01:51:27,782 --> 01:51:29,638
I didn't see that coming.

1182
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:31,619
Viper is a dangerous.

1183
01:51:31,683 --> 01:51:33,647
I know, but she is just a piece,

1184
01:51:33,649 --> 01:51:36,443
until your grandfather's
wishes come true.

1185
01:51:36,957 --> 01:51:37,762
Where is she?

1186
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:38,930
Don't worry.

1187
01:51:39,377 --> 01:51:40,503
You are strong.

1188
01:51:41,104 --> 01:51:42,431
You have courage.

1189
01:51:43,631 --> 01:51:44,889
Real courage.

1190
01:51:48,541 --> 01:51:50,837
But that won't help much now.

1191
01:52:04,777 --> 01:52:05,730
What the?

1192
01:52:06,779 --> 01:52:07,820
Believe me .

1193
01:52:08,856 --> 01:52:10,149
Is it difficult?

1194
01:52:10,991 --> 01:52:13,619
We are destined to be together.

1195
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:15,195
Even now.

1196
01:52:16,961 --> 01:52:17,927
Perhaps.

1197
01:52:47,543 --> 01:52:48,335
Stop!

1198
01:52:54,493 --> 01:52:55,456
Seriously?

1199
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:02,192
Let's go.

1200
01:53:05,337 --> 01:53:06,067
Go!

1201
01:53:07,423 --> 01:53:08,271
Run!

1202
01:53:21,854 --> 01:53:22,629
Come on.

1203
01:53:39,038 --> 01:53:40,100
Mariko, come!
Go!

1204
01:53:40,101 --> 01:53:40,763
Run!

1205
01:53:59,646 --> 01:54:00,738
Mariko, get out!

1206
01:56:50,062 --> 01:56:50,860
Come on.

1207
01:56:52,084 --> 01:56:53,294
This is not the way.

1208
01:57:06,704 --> 01:57:07,794
Two hands.

1209
01:57:12,710 --> 01:57:13,713
Master...

1210
01:57:22,094 --> 01:57:22,793
Hey!

1211
01:57:23,412 --> 01:57:24,103
Bub!

1212
01:57:44,003 --> 01:57:44,796
Harada.

1213
01:57:51,235 --> 01:57:52,425
I'm sorry.

1214
01:58:43,506 --> 01:58:44,548
Now, you die.

1215
01:58:45,177 --> 01:58:46,553
Today is not my day.

1216
01:59:31,849 --> 01:59:32,649
Hey!

1217
01:59:40,484 --> 01:59:41,705
Logan-san.

1218
01:59:42,192 --> 01:59:43,923
Don't look so shocked.

1219
01:59:46,613 --> 01:59:50,010
With you at my side,
I survived to Nagasaki.

1220
01:59:50,617 --> 01:59:52,725
Surely I could survive this.

1221
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:56,061
It's alright.

1222
01:59:56,603 --> 01:59:58,054
It won't take long.

1223
01:59:58,292 --> 02:00:00,648
Dr. Green and I have been waiting.

1224
02:00:01,692 --> 02:00:04,638
It's only this armor that's kept me alive.

1225
02:00:05,299 --> 02:00:07,581
We built it to make me strong,

1226
02:00:07,583 --> 02:00:10,312
so I can take what
you would not give.

1227
02:00:10,314 --> 02:00:13,457
And transfer your unwanted healing

1228
02:00:14,474 --> 02:00:16,009
to my body.

1229
02:00:18,937 --> 02:00:21,448
My legacy must be preserved.

1230
02:00:22,747 --> 02:00:26,486
Your mistake was to believe
that a life without end

1231
02:00:26,653 --> 02:00:28,368
can have no meaning.

1232
02:00:30,949 --> 02:00:33,577
It is the only life that can.

1233
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:36,622
Hold on.

1234
02:00:36,788 --> 02:00:38,340
We are almost there.

1235
02:00:38,790 --> 02:00:40,123
The peace,

1236
02:00:40,559 --> 02:00:42,690
the peace you've wanted.

1237
02:00:43,253 --> 02:00:45,309
Your reward.

1238
02:00:46,089 --> 02:00:48,861
You know,
I'm giving you the very death,

1239
02:00:49,801 --> 02:00:51,446
you longed for.

1240
02:01:04,884 --> 02:01:06,148
This feeling

1241
02:01:06,985 --> 02:01:08,990
to be invincible

1242
02:01:12,115 --> 02:01:13,623
like you.

1243
02:01:26,458 --> 02:01:28,201
You are a real monster.

1244
02:01:29,257 --> 02:01:30,158
Mariko.

1245
02:01:31,176 --> 02:01:32,182
It's me.

1246
02:01:32,535 --> 02:01:34,104
Your grandfather.

1247
02:01:35,514 --> 02:01:37,099
I buried my grandfather.

1248
02:02:40,245 --> 02:02:42,252
You asked me to come say goodbye.

1249
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:44,792
Sayonara.

1250
02:03:07,606 --> 02:03:08,727
Are you alright?

1251
02:03:18,784 --> 02:03:19,785
Logan.

1252
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,989
Logan.

1253
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:35,967
Logan.

1254
02:03:48,075 --> 02:03:49,268
You're here.

1255
02:03:51,817 --> 02:03:53,044
Of course.

1256
02:03:55,153 --> 02:03:56,503
Can you stay?

1257
02:03:59,282 --> 02:04:00,564
I can't.

1258
02:04:03,662 --> 02:04:05,041
Yes, you can.

1259
02:04:07,124 --> 02:04:08,529
This is what you wanted.

1260
02:04:11,461 --> 02:04:12,687
Not anymore.

1261
02:04:17,759 --> 02:04:19,591
I'm all alone here.

1262
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:26,099
You put me here.

1263
02:04:28,562 --> 02:04:30,509
You were hurting people, Jean.

1264
02:04:32,274 --> 02:04:33,205
I had to.

1265
02:04:42,242 --> 02:04:43,501
I love you, Jean.

1266
02:04:49,958 --> 02:04:51,428
I always will.

1267
02:05:24,897 --> 02:05:26,517
I will be lonely.

1268
02:05:28,409 --> 02:05:30,311
You are my only family.

1269
02:05:32,732 --> 02:05:35,106
Take care, sister.

1270
02:05:48,683 --> 02:05:51,146
Am I wrong to think
you might visit me soon?

1271
02:06:03,448 --> 02:06:04,547
Stay.

1272
02:06:06,409 --> 02:06:07,760
I can't, princess.

1273
02:06:08,828 --> 02:06:09,968
I'm a soldier,

1274
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:12,082
and I've been hiding too long.

1275

1282

02:06:55,667 --> 02:06:56,418
What?

1284
02:06:56,876 --> 02:06:58,736
Mariko says we can go
wherever we want.

1285
02:06:59,369 --> 02:07:00,361
Just say where.

1286
02:07:02,257 --> 02:07:03,273
What are you doing?

1287

We'll see.

1292
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:30,553

02:09:38,998 --> 02:09:39,785
Opt out.

1302
02:09:52,969 --> 02:09:54,137
You can go ahead, sir.

1303
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:55,180
I'll wait.

1304
02:10:03,938 --> 02:10:05,246
What do you want?

1305
02:10:07,192 --> 02:10:09,694
There are dark forces, Wolverine.

1306
02:10:11,362 --> 02:10:13,773
Human forces building a weapon

1307
02:10:13,841 --> 02:10:17,023
that could bring about the end of our kind.

1308
02:10:19,871 --> 02:10:22,033
What do I want?
I want your help.

1309
02:10:23,458 --> 02:10:25,043
Why would I trust you?

1310
02:10:26,211 --> 02:10:27,545
You would not.

1311
02:10:52,237 --> 02:10:53,406
Hello, Logan.

1312
02:10:57,867 --> 02:10:59,476
How is this possible?

1313
02:10:59,911 --> 02:11:02,664
As I told you a long time ago

1314
02:11:03,915 --> 02:11:06,501
you are not the only one with gifts.
