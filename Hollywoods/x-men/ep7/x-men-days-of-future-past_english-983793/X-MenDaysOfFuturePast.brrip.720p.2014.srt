1
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:15,567
the future.

2
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,201
A dark desolate world.

3
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:30,889
A world in war, suffering loss ..

4
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:33,296
.. On both sides.

5
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:38,876
Mutants and the humans who dare to help them

6
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:46,285
fighting an enemy we cannot defeat.

7
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:16,022
Are we destined on this path?

8
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:21,559
Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?

9
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:29,967
Or can we evolve fast
enough to change ourselves?

10
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,152
Change our fate?

11
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:41,219
Is the future truly set?

12
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,057
They here!

13
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:18,480
Time's-up!

14
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,587
Sentinel!

15
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,772
Sunspot.

16
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:30,811
Let's go!

17
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:01,399
Blink!

18
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:02,524
No!

19
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,898
It's too late
assholes!

20
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:12,623
<i>Come here!</i>

21
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,385
<i>Get your hands up!!</i>

22
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:16,741
<i>- Get down!!
- No!!!</i>

23
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,417
<i>No!!!</i>

24
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:27,974
So few of us left.

25
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,313
<i> Professor. </i>

26
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,027
I found them.

27
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:07,835
Professor.

28
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:11,717
- Bobby.
- Hey, Storm.

29
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,355
Hey kid.

30
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:15,551
<i> Professor. </i>

31
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:17,854
You made it.

32
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,649
Whenever the sentinels attack

33
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:32,078
Warpath spots them.

34
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:35,219
And I sent Bishop back to
warn us of the attack...

35
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,331
Before it happens.

36
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,986
Blink scouts the next side and..

37
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,899
.. Well then we leave before
they ever know we were there.

38
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,629
Because we never were.

39
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:46,669
What do you mean you were never there?

40
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:49,324
She projects Bishop back
in time a few days...

41
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,371
To warn the others of the coming attack.

42
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:54,009
She sends bishop back in time?

43
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,946
No just his consciousness
into his younger self

44
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:58,609
his younger body.

45
00:10:59,385 --> 00:10:59,971
Wow!

46
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:03,331
This might just work Charles.

47
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:06,101
What might work?

48
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:12,028
The sentinel program was originally
conceived by Dr. Bolivar Trask.

49
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:16,393
In the early 70s he was one of the
world's leading weapons designers.

50
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:21,008
But covertly he had began
experimenting on mutants.

51
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:25,191
Using their gifts to fuel his own research.

52
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:29,262
There was one mutant who had
discovered what he was doing.

53
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:34,618
Mutant with ability to
transform herself to anyone.

54
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,299
Mystique.

55
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,964
I knew her as Raven.

56
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,462
We met when we were children
grew up together.

57
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:45,729
She was like a sister to me.

58
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:47,695
I tried to help her.

59
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,498
But only succeeded in driving her away.

60
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,737
She hunted Trask across the world.

61
00:11:55,368 --> 00:12:00,498
And at the Paris peace accords in 1973
after the Vietnam war.

62
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,454
<i> She found Trask</i>

63
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,677
and killed him.

64
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,842
It was the first time she killed.

65
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,897
Was no last.

66
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:20,179
But killing Trask did not have
the outcome she expected.

67
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,514
It only persuaded the government
of the need for his program.

68
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,663
They captured her that day.

69
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:30,403
Tortured her
Experimented on her.

70
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:35,503
In her DNA they discovered the secret
to her powers of transformation

71
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:37,773
it gave them the key they needed

72
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:41,835
to create weapons that could
adapt to any mutant power.

73
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:44,029
And in less than 50 years

74
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:49,225
the machines that have destroyed so
many of our kind were created.

75
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:53,830
But it all started that day in 1973

76
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:56,299
the day she first killed

77
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:59,688
<i> the day she truly became Mystique. </i>

78
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:03,061
Do you wanna go back there?

79
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:06,639
If I can get to her
stop the assassination

80
00:13:06,824 --> 00:13:08,400
keep her out of their hands

81
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:11,950
Then we can stop the sentinels
from ever being born.

82
00:13:12,177 --> 00:13:15,021
And end this war
before it ever begins.

83
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,863
I can send someone back a couple of weeks.

84
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:26,967
Maybe a month but you're talking
about going back decades.

85
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:30,618
You have the most powerful
brain in the world professor.

86
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,873
<i> But the mind can only stretch
so far before it snaps.</i>

87
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:37,968
<i>It would rip you apart. I'm sorry. </i>

88
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:40,291
<i> No one can survive that trip. </i>

89
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:44,071
What if someone's mind has a
way of snaping back?

90
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:48,339
What if someone can heal as
fast as they're ripped apart?

91
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:15,159
<i>Okay spread out. </i>

92
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:16,672
<i> Take you position.</i>

93
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:34,934
So I wake up in my younger
body god knows where, then what?

94
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:38,351
You need to go to my house and find me

95
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:41,320
convince me of all of this.

96
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,042
Wouldn't you just be able to read my mind?

97
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:46,012
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

98
00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:50,707
Logan you're going to have to do for
me what I once did for you

99
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:53,162
lead me guide me.

100
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:56,200
I was a very different man then.

101
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:58,246
You'll have to be patient with me.

102
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,332
Patience is my strongest suit.

103
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:03,645
You'll need me as well.

104
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:04,462
What?

105
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:06,979
After Mystique left Charles
she came with me

106
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:09,150
and I set her on a dangerous path.

107
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:11,883
Darker path.

108
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,681
It's going to take the
two of us side by side

109
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,189
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

110
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:21,911
Great.

111
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,384
So where do I find you?

112
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:26,329
Well..It's complicated.

113
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:33,526
Basically your body will go to sleep
while your mind travels back in time.

114
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:37,293
As long as you back there past and present
will continue to co-exist.

115
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,169
But once you wake up....

116
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:44,162
.. Whatever you've done will
take hold and become history.

117
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:47,081
And for the rest of us that will
be the only history that we know.

118
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,108
That will be like
last 50 years never happened.

119
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:53,579
This world
this war.

120
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,083
The only person who'll remember it

121
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
...is you.

122
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:03,452
Alright Logan I need you to clear your
head and to stay as calm as possible.

123
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:04,675
What do you mean?

124
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:07,519
If your mind gets rocky
it will harder for me to hold you.

125
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:09,814
You could start to slip
between past and future.

126
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:11,736
What if I need to get a little rocky ?

127
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:14,303
Think peaceful thoughts.

128
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,782
Peaceful thoughts.

129
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:17,340
Do you have any good news?

130
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,044
Well

131
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:21,680
you don't really age so you'll
pretty much look the same.

132
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,163
You won't have much time in past.

133
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:27,150
Sentinels will find us
they always do.

134
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,885
And this time we won't
be able to run. We'll have no escape.

135
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,687
This is our last chance.

136
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:36,572
You really think this will work?

137
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:38,352
I have faith in him.

138
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:41,211
It's not him I'm worried about. It's us.

139
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:43,905
We were young.
We didn't know any better.

140
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:45,917
We will now.

141
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:50,162
See you all soon.

142
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,413
This might sting a little.

143
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,151
Holy shit!!

144
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:38,839
It worked.

145
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:45,589
Hey what's going on?

146
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,588
- Gwen! Get dressed!
- Who are you?

147
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:48,868
Hey I don't know what's going on here.

148
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,103
What's going on is you supposed to guard
your boss's daughter not screwing her.

149
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:53,997
I didn't sleep with her.

150
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,354
- No?
- No.

151
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:59,104
I mean yes
I slept with her many times but...

152
00:18:59,144 --> 00:18:59,862
Jimmy!

153
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,260
That wasn't me. That was the old me.

154
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:06,047
- I just got here like 20 seconds ago.
- Really?

155
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,662
- Yeah.
- What happen to your clothes?

156
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:08,902
My wha...
Oh

157
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:13,055
Will you believe me if I told you
I was sent here from the future?

158
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:17,001
- Get out of here sweetheart.
- Yeah

159
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,357
we're gonna take care of this comedian.

160
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:19,046
No, you're not.

161
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,299
You gonna give me the keys to
your car and some money for gas

162
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,956
or you gonna wake up in a hospital.

163
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,656
Trust me I know how these things play out.

164
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:27,069
- Oh, because you're from the future?
- No

165
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:29,571
...because of these.

166
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:32,558
What the hell!!

167
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,341
Ahhh...Damn it.

168
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:01,154
Peaceful thoughts.

169
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,897
<i> We are reviewing all of
our defense expenditures</i>

170
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:22,077
<i> and all the black books are being opened. </i>

171
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:25,880
<i> We can't support a weapon that
targets our own citizens </i>

172
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,290
if these mutants as you described

173
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:32,160
are already living among us
then they are living here peacefully.

174
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:33,936
We haven't had an
incident in over 10 years.

175
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:35,611
After what happened in Cuba?

176
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,042
That was never confirmed.

177
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,328
We have very real enemies out there.

178
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:41,009
The Russians
the Chinese.

179
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:46,015
We are talking about a tenth of a
tenth of a tenth of our population.

180
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:49,681
- Allow me to read something to you.
- Please.

181
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:52,916
This was acquired by our
friends at the CIA.

182
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,235
It's in a dissertation

183
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:57,901
written by a mutant
at Oxford university.

184
00:20:59,017 --> 00:20:59,784
And I quote.

185
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:05,178
<i>To Homo neanderthalensis his
mutant cousin of homo sapiens</i>

186
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:06,666
<i>which is us.</i>

187
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:08,349
Was an aberration

188
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:12,424
the arrival of mutated human
species: Homo sapiens.

189
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:16,642
Was followed by the immediate extinction
of the their less evolve kin.

190
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:17,869
Well

191
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:19,956
now..

192
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,081
<i>We are the neanderthals.</i>

193
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,344
Speak for yourself
Dr. Trask.

194
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,926
<i> You know when you sent
our soldiers to Vietnam</i>

195
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:32,209
<i>without the weapons they
needed to win the war</i>

196
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,220
<i> you underestimated your enemy. </i>

197
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:36,756
You heh, you do that with this enemy.

198
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:41,925
it won't be some border skirmish
halfway around the world.

199
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:45,809
<i> This time the war will be for our
streets, our cities, our homes.</i>

200
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,722
And by the time you see
the need for my program

201
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:52,445
it will be too late.

202
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,241
And you will have lost two
wars in one life time.

203
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,869
We're sorry
Dr. Trask.

204
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,392
But your sentinel program

205
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,791
it ain't gonna fly.

206
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:21,557
Can I help you colonel?

207
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,417
Just here to give my
boys a proper send off.

208
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:27,849
Sorry sir. But we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

209
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:31,053
Stand aside soldier.
That's an order.

210
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,591
Attenhut.

211
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:44,680
At ease.

212
00:23:08,084 --> 00:23:09,106
What is all this?

213
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:12,583
Lab reports blood tests. It's all
getting packed up and shipped back.

214
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:13,865
Where is it going?

215
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,265
Same place they are.

216
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:16,874
Trask industries.

217
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,097
Let's go gentleman

218
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,895
taking you out of this shit show.

219
00:23:22,455 --> 00:23:23,896
Shipping home?

220
00:23:25,684 --> 00:23:26,651
Not just yet.

221
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:29,140
What are you doing with those?

222
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:30,837
It's only gonna make the ride a little smoother.

223
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:33,768
We are transferring you to a
private facility where we can..

224
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:35,189
Run a few more tests.

225
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,724
Your men are not military.

226
00:23:44,348 --> 00:23:47,655
Private outfit.
We're authorized to command these men.

227
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,333
These troops are going home.

228
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:54,815
Well colonel...

229
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:57,142
I don't believe you have the
jurisdiction in this matter.

230
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:00,338
I'm afraid I do son.

231
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:02,792
I'm sorry who are you?

232
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,753
The question is major.

233
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,060
Who are you?

234
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:56,486
Raven.

235
00:24:57,182 --> 00:24:58,394
That's not my name.

236
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:06,973
- I had that.
- I know.

237
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:10,762
Let's move out.
Come on let's go.

238
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:12,369
Where's Erik?

239
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:13,923
I'm on my own now.

240
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:18,105
Let's go. Move it.

241
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,137
Hold that plane!

242
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:39,143
Keep going

243
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:42,016
I wouldn't wanna leave these boys
to this godforsaken country

244
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:43,092
Yes sir.

245
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:44,689
You're not coming with us are you?

246
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:48,646
My war is not over.
The enemy is still out there.

247
00:26:12,123 --> 00:26:12,809
Where did they go?

248
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,245
The 4 privates where did they go?

249
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:15,662
They were headed towards the Tarmac.

250
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:16,007
Can I help you?

251
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:18,750
Ahh yeah what happened to the school?

252
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:20,860
School has been shut for years.

253
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,275
Are you a parent?

254
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:23,861
Sure as hell hope not.

255
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,189
- Who are you?
- I'm Hank.

256
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:28,433
Hank Maccoy I look
after the house now.

257
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:31,137
You are beast?

258
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,851
Look at you
guess you are a late bloomer.

259
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,164
I do not know what you're talking about.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

260
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:40,204
- Where is the professor?
- There is no professor here.

261
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,144
You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid.

262
00:27:43,143 --> 00:27:45,033
Sure there is no little beast thing in here?

263
00:27:45,294 --> 00:27:46,592
- Come on beast.
- Beast is not here.

264
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:47,779
- Come on beasty.
- Go!

265
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,138
Hey!!

266
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,482
I said the school is closed.
You need to leave.

267
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:54,928
Not until I see the professor.

268
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,112
There is no professor here.
I told you that.

269
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:01,300
Look kid.
You and I are gonna be good friends.

270
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:05,495
You just don't know it yet.

271
00:28:07,877 --> 00:28:08,739
Professor!

272
00:28:09,928 --> 00:28:11,006
Ahhh.....

273
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,692
Professor!

274
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:34,872
Hank what's going on here?

275
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,225
- Professor.
- Please don't call me that.

276
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:40,890
Why, you know this guy?

277
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:43,430
Yeah he looks slightly familiar

278
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:45,219
get off the bloody chandelier Hank.

279
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:48,512
You can walk.

280
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:50,032
You're a perceptive one.

281
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:51,058
I thought Erik ..

282
00:28:51,258 --> 00:28:54,379
Which makes it slightly perplaxing that you
managed to miss our sign on the way in

283
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:58,600
this is private property my friend
I'm gonna have to ask him to ask you to leave.

284
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:02,671
Well I'm afraid I can't do that because...

285
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:05,998
..Because I was sent here for you

286
00:29:06,153 --> 00:29:09,687
well tell whoever it was
that sent you that I'm busy.

287
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:14,161
This gonna be a little tricky
because the person who sent me..

288
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:15,403
Was you.

289
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:17,740
- What?
- About 50 years from now.

290
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:20,792
50 years from now like in the
future 50 years from now.

291
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:21,073
Yeah.

292
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:22,970
- I sent you from the future.
- Yeah.

293
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:24,436
Piss off.

294
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:28,210
If you had your powers
you know I was telling the truth.

295
00:29:28,678 --> 00:29:30,309
How do you know I don't have my.....

296
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:33,224
- Who are you?
- I told you.

297
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:34,810
- Are you CIA?
- No.

298
00:29:34,912 --> 00:29:35,775
You were watching me.

299
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,854
I know you Charles.

300
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:39,262
We've been friends for years.

301
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,232
I know your powers came when you were 9.

302
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:44,907
I know you thought you
were going crazy when

303
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,036
it started all the
voices in your head.

304
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:49,283
And it wasn't until you
were 12 that you realized

305
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:51,436
all the voices were in
everyone else's head.

306
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:53,374
Do you want me to go on?

307
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:57,004
I never told anyone that.

308
00:29:57,188 --> 00:30:00,040
Not yet no but you will.

309
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:04,530
Alright you've picked my interest
what do you want?

310
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:07,267
We have to stop Raven.

311
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:11,305
I need your help.

312
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:13,891
We need your help.

313
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:20,910
Think I'd like to wake up now.

314
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:27,877
What does she have to do with this?

315
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,428
So you're saying that they
took Raven's power and what?

316
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:38,691
They weaponized it?

317
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:39,683
Yep

318
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:41,900
she is unique.

319
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,676
Yes she is.

320
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:47,504
In the beginning the sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

321
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:50,416
Then they began to identify
the genetics in non-mutants.

322
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:55,188
Who would eventually have mutant
children or grandchildren.

323
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:58,516
Many of the humans tried to help us,
it was a slaughter.

324
00:30:58,902 --> 00:31:01,200
leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge

325
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:03,630
I've been in a lot of worse.

326
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:07,502
I've never seen anything like this.

327
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,261
And it all starts with her.

328
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:13,321
Let's just say that for the sake of

329
00:31:13,535 --> 00:31:17,501
The sake that I choose to believe you
that I choose to help you.

330
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:19,456
Raven won't listen to me.

331
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:25,330
No her heart and soul belongs
to someone else now.

332
00:31:26,107 --> 00:31:26,867
I know.

333
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:30,905
That's why we gonna need Magneto too.

334
00:31:32,362 --> 00:31:32,922
Erik?

335
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:35,394
You do know where he is?

336
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,477
Yeah.

337
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,896
He's where he belongs.

338
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,464
That's it
you're just gonna walk out?

339
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:49,044
Oh top marks like I said
you are perceptive.

340
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,074
The professor I know would
never turn his back

341
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:52,592
..on someone who lost their path

342
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:54,770
especially someone he loved.

343
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:58,648
You know..

344
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:00,911
I think I do remember you now.

345
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:05,137
Yeah we came to you a long
time ago seeking your help.

346
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,154
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then

347
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:12,863
fuck off!

348
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:16,481
Listen to me you little shit
I've come a long way

349
00:32:16,593 --> 00:32:19,131
and I watched a lot of people die
good people, friends.

350
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:22,686
If you're gonna wallow in
self pity and do nothing

351
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:25,008
then you're gonna watch the same thing
you understand?

352
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:31,883
We all have to die some time.

353
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:39,231
I told you there was
no professor here.

354
00:32:41,184 --> 00:32:42,330
What the hell happened to him?

355
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:53,254
<i> He lost everything.
Erik, Raven, his legs. </i>

356
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,487
We built the school, the labs,
this .. this whole place.

357
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,889
Then just after the first semester

358
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,664
the war in Vietnam got worse.

359
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:07,351
Many of the teachers and
all the students were drafted.

360
00:33:08,097 --> 00:33:09,362
I mean it broke him.

361
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:11,874
<i> He retreated into himself.. </i>

362
00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:14,659
<i>I wanted to help do something so.. </i>

363
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:16,946
<i> So I designed a serum to
treat his spine</i>

364
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:21,365
<i> derived from the same formula that
helps me control my mutation. </i>

365
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:25,070
I take just enough to
keep myself balanced but

366
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:28,165
he takes too much.

367
00:33:28,897 --> 00:33:32,495
I tried easing him back but he
just couldn't bear the pain

368
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:33,829
the voices..

369
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,966
The treatment gives
him his legs but

370
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:38,979
it's not enough

371
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,802
he's..

372
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,333
He's just lost too much.

373
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,672
<i> You're not scared of me? </i>

374
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:04,194
<i>I always believed I couldn't be
the only one in the world.</i>

375
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:07,107
<i> Charles Xavier. </i>

376
00:34:09,145 --> 00:34:09,724
Raven .

377
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,700
You're hungry and alone?

378
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,138
Take whatever you want.

379
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,489
We got lots of food
you don't have to steal. .

380
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:22,514
In fact you never have to steal again.

381
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,222
<i>And that's a promise. </i>

382
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:32,213
I'll help you get her.

383
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,756
Not for any of your
future shots but for her.

384
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:38,811
Fair enough.

385
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:42,646
I'll tell you this
you don't know Erik.

386
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,147
That man is a monster.
A murderer.

387
00:34:45,554 --> 00:34:47,958
You think you can convince Raven to change?

388
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:49,251
To come home?

389
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:50,870
That's splendid.

390
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,964
But what makes you think
you can change him?

391
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:57,902
Because you and Erik
sent me back here together.

392
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:03,581
The room they're holding him
in was built during the

393
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:05,977
2nd world war when there
was a shortage of steel

394
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:09,652
so the foundation is pure
concrete and sand no metal.

395
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:13,443
He's being held a 100
floors beneath the most

396
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,933
heavily guarded building on the planet.

397
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:17,084
Why is he in there?

398
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:20,441
What he forgot to mention?

399
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,479
Ahhh JFK

400
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:25,222
He killed him?

401
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:29,547
What else would explain the bullet
miraculously curving through the air

402
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,465
Eric's always had a way with guns.

403
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:33,619
Are you sure you want
to carry on with this?

404
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:35,218
This is your plan
not mine.

405
00:35:35,387 --> 00:35:38,200
We don't have any resources
to get us in or out

406
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:40,826
it's just me and Hank.

407
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:42,325
I know a guy.

408
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:45,559
Yeah he'd be a young man now
grew up outside of DC

409
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,330
he could get into anywhere

410
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:51,642
just don't know how the
hell we're gonna find him

411
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,642
history provided the question

412
00:35:58,692 --> 00:35:59,818
we have a phone book

413
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:09,393
I thought you'd be getting
ready for your trip sir.

414
00:36:09,706 --> 00:36:11,557
I just came to grab couple of files.

415
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,142
Is that a new scarf?

416
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,992
It's nice.

417
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:16,353
Thank you.

418
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,136
Dr. Trask.

419
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:50,096
One second.

420
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,708
We added some names to the Paris meeting

421
00:37:58,293 --> 00:37:59,282
thank you.

422
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:02,571
Is something wrong sir?

423
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:04,017
No.

424
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,446
It's nothing.

425
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:07,821
Would you mind typing up my itinerary.

426
00:38:08,798 --> 00:38:10,116
I don't wanna miss anything.

427
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,071
What's he done now?

428
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:45,553
I'll just write you a check
for whatever he took.

429
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:46,968
We just need talk to him.

430
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:52,141
Peter the cops are here..

431
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:53,412
.. Again.

432
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:03,040
Guess what I didn't do anything

433
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,962
I've been here all day.

434
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:07,703
Just relax Peter
we are not cops.

435
00:39:07,864 --> 00:39:09,943
Of course, you're not cops if you were
cops you wouldn't drive a rental car

436
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:11,344
how'd you know we got a rental car?

437
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:13,090
I checked your registration when you
were walking through the door

438
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:14,798
I also had some time to
kill so I went through your

439
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,262
rental agreements saw you
were from out of town

440
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:17,548
are you FBI?

441
00:39:18,477 --> 00:39:21,648
No, you're not cops
hey what's with this gifted youngsters place

442
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:23,955
that's an old card.

443
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:26,460
He is fascinating he
is a pain in the ass.

444
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:27,446
What teleporter?

445
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:28,783
No, he's just fast.

446
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:31,832
When I know him he wasn't so young.

447
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:33,740
Young?
You're just old.

448
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:36,746
So you're not afraid to show your powers?

449
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,830
Powers? What powers?
What are you talking about?

450
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:40,842
You see some strange here?

451
00:39:42,238 --> 00:39:44,520
Nothing anybody would believe if you told them.

452
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:49,639
So who are you?
What do you want?

453
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:50,973
We need your help Peter.

454
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:51,671
With what?

455
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:54,495
Break into a highly secured facility

456
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:55,732
and get someone out.

457
00:39:55,932 --> 00:39:56,614
Prison break?

458
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,432
That's illegal you know.

459
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:04,431
Well only if you get caught.

460
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:05,966
So what's in it for me?

461
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,510
You the kleptomaniac
get to break into the Pentagon.

462
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:16,871
How do I know I can trust you?

463
00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:19,456
Because we are just like you.

464
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:22,897
Show him.

465
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,224
It's cool just disgusting

466
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,951
built in 1943 the Pentagon is the
world largest office building.

467
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:48,150
Housing more than 25,000 military employees
stretched over 6 million square feet.

468
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,930
<i>Where is the bathroom?
I need to pee. </i>

469
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,764
Well, lucky for you, you'll have plenty to choose from
The building was constructed during ...

470
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,012
Thank you.

471
00:41:55,268 --> 00:41:57,742
Yeah we're getting broadcast signal down here?
What's going on?

472
00:41:57,804 --> 00:41:59,429
Damn it!! Call maintenance
get them down here.

473
00:43:39,137 --> 00:43:40,456
<i>....from a Japanese empire.</i>

474
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,383
<i>This month long battle...</i>

475
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:45,756
<i>Included some of the fearsest
fighting during World War II</i>

476
00:44:01,523 --> 00:44:03,681
in 3 seconds those doors are going to open

477
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,381
and 20 guards will be here to shoot us.

478
00:44:07,702 --> 00:44:08,968
I know that's what I'm waiting for

479
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:10,195
what are you doing?

480
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:12,142
I'm holding your neck so
you won't get whip-lash

481
00:44:12,297 --> 00:44:12,844
what?

482
00:44:13,044 --> 00:44:15,675
Whip.....Laaaaaash

483
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:37,676
You're good. It'll pass.

484
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:39,576
It happens when I run.

485
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:42,778
Must have done something pretty serious.

486
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:46,066
What did you do man?
What did you do.

487
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,565
What did you do?
Why would they have you in there.

488
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,700
For killing the president.

489
00:44:55,178 --> 00:44:58,377
Anything I'm guilty of is fighting
for people like us

490
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:00,592
you take karate?
You know karate man?

491
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,286
I don't know karate.

492
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:03,949
but I know crazy.

493
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:08,390
Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
this is a code red situation

494
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,857
we are evacuating the entire floor so
that we my uh associate and I can uh

495
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:15,196
- secure the prisoner.
- Who are you?

496
00:45:15,265 --> 00:45:20,085
We are special operations
CB, FE, CIED look

497
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:22,196
perhaps you didn't hear
me what first I spoke

498
00:45:22,257 --> 00:45:25,698
it's imperative that you understand
we're in complete lockdown situation.

499
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:27,467
We have to get in to the 3rd floor

500
00:45:34,848 --> 00:45:36,299
Oh I'm sorry
were you finished?

501
00:45:41,934 --> 00:45:43,568
They told me you controled metal.

502
00:45:44,104 --> 00:45:44,626
They?

503
00:45:48,132 --> 00:45:51,145
You know my mom once knew a
guy who could do that.

504
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:56,841
Sorry I'm just not very
good with violence.

505
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:00,705
Charles.

506
00:46:07,658 --> 00:46:09,626
Good to see you too old friend.

507
00:46:09,693 --> 00:46:12,377
- And walking?
- Not thanks to you.

508
00:46:14,374 --> 00:46:16,852
You're the last person in the
world I expected to see today.

509
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:20,202
Believe me I wouldn't
be here if I didn't have to.

510
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:22,449
If we get you out of here we do it my way

511
00:46:22,634 --> 00:46:23,545
no killing.

512
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:24,634
No helmet.

513
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,257
I couldn't disobey you even if I want to.

514
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,172
I'm never getting inside
of that head again.

515
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:33,251
I need your word Erik.

516
00:46:36,846 --> 00:46:37,982
No body move!

517
00:46:38,182 --> 00:46:39,957
Hold it right there!

518
00:46:42,397 --> 00:46:43,515
<i>Charles.
 Don't move! </i>

519
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:46,584
Hands up or we will shoot!

520
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:47,912
- Freeze them Charles.
- I can't.

521
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:48,862
Hands up!

522
00:46:54,465 --> 00:46:54,674
No!

523
00:47:08,483 --> 00:47:12,505
<i>If I could save time in bottle....<i>

524
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:17,291
<i>The first thing that I like to do...<i>

525
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:25,065
<i>Is to save every day
'til eternity passes away...<i>

526
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,108
<i>Just to spend them with you....<i>

527
00:47:29,656 --> 00:47:34,048
<i>If I could make days last forever...<i>

528
00:47:34,743 --> 00:47:38,644
<i>If words could make wishes come true..<i>

529
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:45,022
<i>I'd save every day like
a treasure and then..<i>

530
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:49,406
<i>Again
I would spend them with you..<i>

531
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,603
<i>But there never seems to be enough time..<i>

532
00:47:53,723 --> 00:47:57,896
<i>To do the things you want
to do once you find them..<i>

533
00:48:01,986 --> 00:48:04,504
<i>I've looked around enough to know..<i>

534
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,294
<i>That you're the one I want
to go through time with..<i>

535
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:49,300
Thanks kid.

536
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:56,713
Peter thank you very very much.

537
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:57,968
You take care.

538
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,182
Yeah I saw your flight plan in the cockpit
why are you going to Paris?

539
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,545
Imagine if they were metal.

540
00:49:15,178 --> 00:49:17,002
- Do me a favor and return it for me.
- Okay.

541
00:49:17,032 --> 00:49:17,860
Peter...

542
00:49:18,752 --> 00:49:19,830
Take it slowly.

543
00:49:21,327 --> 00:49:22,682
Where did they dig you up?

544
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:27,114
You're gonna find this hard to believe
but ahh..

545
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,133
You sent me.

546
00:49:29,813 --> 00:49:31,447
You and Charles

547
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:33,282
from the future.

548
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,766
How did you lose them?

549
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:01,275
The treatment for my spine affects my DNA.

550
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:06,249
You sacrificed your powers
so you could walk?

551
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,691
I sacrificed my power so that I could Slee..

552
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:14,134
What do you know about it?

553
00:50:14,286 --> 00:50:16,251
- I lost my fair share
- Hah

554
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:18,505
Dry your eyes Erik.

555
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:20,650
It doesn't justify what you've done.

556
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:22,502
You've no idea what I have done.

557
00:50:22,623 --> 00:50:24,643
I know that you took the
things that mean most to me.

558
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:26,841
Well maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

559
00:50:27,248 --> 00:50:30,256
If you want to fight Erik
I'll give you a fight

560
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:32,623
- Let him come.
- You abandoned me!

561
00:50:32,912 --> 00:50:35,389
You took her away and you abandoned me!

562
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:36,272
Angel.

563
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:37,889
Azazel.

564
00:50:39,015 --> 00:50:39,887
Emma.

565
00:50:40,848 --> 00:50:41,626
Banshee.

566
00:50:43,544 --> 00:50:46,741
Mutant brothers and sisters all dead!

567
00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:50,791
Countless others

568
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:53,573
- ..experimented on, butchered.
- Erik.

569
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:54,868
Where were you Charles?

570
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:57,568
We were supposed to protect them!

571
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:00,665
Where were you when your own people needed you?

572
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:01,845
Hiding!

573
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,363
You and Hank pretending to be
something you're not

574
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:06,635
Erik.

575
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:11,434
You abandoned us all.

576
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,106
So you were always an asshole

577
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,858
I take it we're best buddies in the future

578
00:51:40,776 --> 00:51:43,644
I spent a lot of years trying
to bring you down Bob

579
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,821
how's that work out for you?

580
00:51:46,154 --> 00:51:47,540
You're like me.

581
00:51:49,388 --> 00:51:50,170
You're a survivor.

582
00:51:55,227 --> 00:51:57,024
You wanna pick all that shit up?

583
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:19,844
<i>General, maybe you should go slowly,
we have a long day tomorrow.</i>

584
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:22,438
<i>We are celebrating,
captain.</i>

585
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,553
<i>It's not every day
that we win a war</i>

586
00:52:24,554 --> 00:52:26,836
<i>Much less against
the damn Americans</i>

587
00:52:28,636 --> 00:52:30,037
<i>I'll get another bottle.</i>

588
00:52:47,525 --> 00:52:51,914
<i>- My apologies.
- I assure you it was my fault.</i>

589
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:54,900
<i>- Do you speak Vietnamese.
- I'm a performer.</i>

590
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:59,396
<i>I speak many languages.</i>

591
00:52:59,397 --> 00:53:02,066
<i>Let me buy you another drink,</i>

592
00:53:02,101 --> 00:53:04,587
<i>unless you are
accompanied.</i>

593
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,678
<i>I'm alone.</i>

594
00:53:08,905 --> 00:53:11,293
<i>A bottle of Johnnie Walker,
Please.</i>

595
00:53:26,027 --> 00:53:28,782
<i>You go to the Dome tomorrow?</i>

596
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:38,752
<i>A beautiful girl
interested in politics ...</i>

597
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:41,391
<i>Appearances can be deceiving.</i>

598
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Show me more baby
Clothes off.

599
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,500
What's the matter baby?
you don't think I look pretty like this

600
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:57,467
Fancy a game? It's been a while.

601
00:54:57,566 --> 00:54:59,120
I'm not in a mood for games, thank you.

602
00:55:06,087 --> 00:55:08,415
Haven't had a real sip in 10 years.

603
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:23,142
I didn't kill the president.

604
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:25,945
The bullet curved Erik.

605
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:28,119
Because I was trying to save him.

606
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:31,144
They took me out before I could.

607
00:55:31,187 --> 00:55:33,692
- Why would you trying to save him?
- Because he was one of us.

608
00:55:45,877 --> 00:55:48,359
You must think me so foolish.

609
00:55:50,244 --> 00:55:52,197
You've always said they would come after us.

610
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,142
I never imagined they'd
use Raven's DNA to do it.

611
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,288
When did you last see her?

612
00:56:01,477 --> 00:56:02,907
The day I left for Dallas.

613
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:05,377
And how was she?

614
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:08,569
Strong.

615
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:10,527
Driven

616
00:56:11,947 --> 00:56:13,193
- loyal.
- How..

617
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:15,147
How was she?

618
00:56:17,192 --> 00:56:20,125
She was..
We were..

619
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,845
I could see why she
meant so much to you.

620
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:32,166
You should be proud of her Charles.

621
00:56:33,899 --> 00:56:35,646
She is out there fighting for our cause.

622
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:36,829
Your cause.

623
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:40,562
The girl I raised she was
not capable of killing.

624
00:56:40,649 --> 00:56:42,562
You didn't raise her
you grew up with her.

625
00:56:42,684 --> 00:56:44,894
She couldn't stay a little girl forever
that's why she left

626
00:56:44,957 --> 00:56:48,331
she left because you got inside her head

627
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:51,061
that's not my power.

628
00:56:53,228 --> 00:56:55,025
She made a choice.

629
00:56:55,063 --> 00:56:57,715
But now we know where that choice leads
don't we?

630
00:56:58,133 --> 00:57:01,042
She's going to murder Trask
they're going to capture her

631
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:03,228
and then they're going to wipe us out.

632
00:57:03,723 --> 00:57:05,748
Not if we get to her first.

633
00:57:06,913 --> 00:57:09,006
Not if we change history tomorrow.

634
00:57:14,628 --> 00:57:15,720
I'm sorry Charles.

635
00:57:20,723 --> 00:57:23,720
For what happened I truly am

636
00:57:27,128 --> 00:57:29,331
It's been a while since I've played

637
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,963
I'll go easy on you.

638
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,138
Might finally be a fair fight.

639
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:39,893
You have the first move.

640
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:58,025
The diplomats from all around the
world arriving here today at the

641
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:59,797
<i> hotel royale.</i>

642
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:03,052
<i> It's a historic day as
the official ending of </i>

643
00:58:03,075 --> 00:58:05,731
<i> the United States fierce military
involvement in Vietnam.</i>

644
00:58:06,425 --> 00:58:08,421
Now we have the south
vietnamese foreign minister

645
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:10,440
with other south
vietnamese dignitaries

646
00:58:10,915 --> 00:58:13,329
the summit doesn't begin for another hour

647
00:58:13,675 --> 00:58:16,938
the hotel has arranged a private room
upstairs for your special quest

648
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:18,094
That'll be plenty of time.

649
00:58:22,986 --> 00:58:24,920
Good afternoon everyone
hello.

650
00:58:24,988 --> 00:58:26,142
Thank you for coming.

651
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:29,788
Congratulations on winning this war.

652
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:34,160
Now I know you all have hands to
shake and photos to take downstairs

653
00:58:34,173 --> 00:58:35,913
so I will get right to the point.

654
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:39,501
There is a new enemy out there.

655
00:58:40,282 --> 00:58:42,696
An enemy that will render
your arsenals useless

656
00:58:42,782 --> 00:58:46,047
your armies powerless and
your nations defenseless.

657
00:58:51,956 --> 00:58:53,822
<i> You'll need a new weapon for this war.</i>

658
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:55,990
<i> I call them "sentinels". </i>

659
00:58:57,895 --> 00:59:02,227
Named after the ancient guardians
that stood at the gates of the citadel.

660
00:59:03,934 --> 00:59:06,817
They have the aeronautic
capabilities of a harrier jet.

661
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:09,702
Armed with guns that can fire off

662
00:59:09,764 --> 00:59:13,759
<i> more than 2,000 rounds per minute of
thermo-ceramic ammunition.</i>

663
00:59:14,252 --> 00:59:16,982
But size power speed

664
00:59:17,127 --> 00:59:19,200
<i> you can find that at Lockheed or Boeing.
No </i>

665
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,957
<i> What makes the
sentinels so special</i>

666
00:59:22,098 --> 00:59:25,103
<i> Is the ability to target
the mutant X gene </i>

667
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:29,820
The genetic guidance system that can
lock onto a mark half a mile away.

668
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:33,545
And won't trigger unless it
has identified the target.

669
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,361
With this weapon there'll be
no human collateral damage.

670
00:59:36,595 --> 00:59:39,509
If I turn it on the system
couldn't even activate in here.

671
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:48,242
<i> Unless... </i>

672
00:59:49,175 --> 00:59:51,134
...there's a mutant.

673
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:02,473
There has to be some kind of mistake.

674
01:00:03,568 --> 01:00:06,943
My machines don't make mistakes.

675
01:00:08,607 --> 01:00:10,479
What are you?

676
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:12,979
I assure you

677
01:00:14,368 --> 01:00:15,868
I ..

678
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:16,801
No. Don't shoot it.

679
01:00:17,354 --> 01:00:18,344
<i> I assure you. </i>

680
01:00:18,427 --> 01:00:19,072
Do not arrest him.

681
01:00:19,146 --> 01:00:20,146
I do not know what you're talking about.

682
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:55,570
<i> Raven! </i>

683
01:01:00,851 --> 01:01:02,270
Raven.

684
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:03,372
Raven!

685
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:07,926
Raven.

686
01:01:10,753 --> 01:01:11,487
Charles.

687
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:13,977
We've come for you.
Erik and I.

688
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:15,529
Together.

689
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:18,434
<i>I never thought I would
see you again. </i>

690
01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:22,075
<i>I made you a promise long time
ago that I would protect you.</i>

691
01:01:22,123 --> 01:01:24,928
<i>I didn't. And I know I haven't kept my promise</i>

692
01:01:30,227 --> 01:01:31,187
<i> Wolverine! </i>

693
01:01:35,388 --> 01:01:37,863
I'm going to keep you safe
I'm going to keep you out of their hands

694
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:42,768
Erik.

695
01:01:43,558 --> 01:01:45,487
Erik.

696
01:01:45,579 --> 01:01:47,123
What are you doing?

697
01:01:47,397 --> 01:01:50,041
Securing our future.

698
01:01:50,128 --> 01:01:51,521
Forgive me Mystique.

699
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:55,144
As long as you're out there
we'll never be safe.

700
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:57,081
Erik.

701
01:01:57,082 --> 01:01:58,624
Use your powers Charles.
Stop him.

702
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,539
He can't.

703
01:02:31,379 --> 01:02:33,142
He is slipping.
He is slipping back.

704
01:02:33,192 --> 01:02:34,492
<i>I'm losing him.</i>

705
01:03:16,102 --> 01:03:17,112
<i> Striker! </i>

706
01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:20,149
<i> ... finish what we started Wolverine
one day</i>

707
01:03:22,157 --> 01:03:22,664
<i> Kitty! </i>

708
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:26,918
Restrain him.

709
01:03:42,525 --> 01:03:43,100
Erik!

710
01:03:53,126 --> 01:03:54,184
Where am I?

711
01:03:54,323 --> 01:03:54,784
Huh?

712
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:58,522
How the hell did I get here?

713
01:03:58,661 --> 01:04:00,159
What? You came to us.

714
01:04:01,227 --> 01:04:02,690
- Who are you?
- Charles.

715
01:04:02,784 --> 01:04:04,047
Charles Xavier.

716
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:05,780
- I do not know you.
- Ahh?

717
01:04:06,205 --> 01:04:07,349
What the hell is that?

718
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:09,972
Woah woah I can deal with this.

719
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:11,825
Just go.
Stop Erik.

720
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:13,433
Erik.

721
01:04:14,202 --> 01:04:15,226
I'm sorry.

722
01:04:15,405 --> 01:04:16,053
Erik.

723
01:04:35,488 --> 01:04:37,191
You are Logan.
That's Hank McCoy.

724
01:04:37,223 --> 01:04:38,118
I'm Charles Xavier.

725
01:04:38,217 --> 01:04:40,122
You spent the last couple of days with us.

726
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:44,935
You're on acid?

727
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,804
Somebody gave you really bad acid.

728
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:50,445
Yeah?

729
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,061
Just hold on tight we'll
get through this together.

730
01:05:38,996 --> 01:05:40,615
- Oh god!
- Kitty.

731
01:05:41,934 --> 01:05:43,799
She is wounded pretty bad.

732
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:49,758
I got him.

733
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,352
Professor.

734
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:57,274
What happened to you?

735
01:06:58,546 --> 01:07:01,194
I just saw someone who's going to
bring me a lot of pain someday.

736
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:05,477
Where is Raven?

737
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:06,597
Gone.

738
01:07:07,073 --> 01:07:08,549
- What?
- We have to get out of here.

739
01:07:18,466 --> 01:07:20,763
Yesterday the Paris
peace summit was rocked

740
01:07:20,776 --> 01:07:23,083
by the appearance of
unidentified assailants.

741
01:07:23,259 --> 01:07:25,250
<i> The likes of which the
world has never seen.</i>

742
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:28,115
<i> Mass hysteria has gripped the
nation as people ask </i>

743
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:30,601
<i> where did they come from?
Will they be back? </i>

744
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,057
<i> And most importantly </i>

745
01:07:32,179 --> 01:07:33,179
<i> are they friend or foe? </i>

746
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:36,114
<i>That was lening
correspondant Toby Elliot</i>

747
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:38,132
<i>reporting from the Paris
peace summit yesterday.</i>

748
01:07:40,611 --> 01:07:41,759
What the hell are we dealing with here?

749
01:07:42,456 --> 01:07:43,617
Off the record.

750
01:07:44,025 --> 01:07:45,157
2 days ago

751
01:07:45,305 --> 01:07:47,785
this man Erick Lehnsherr
escaped from a

752
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:50,289
maximum security prison
inside the Pentagon.

753
01:07:50,336 --> 01:07:53,911
<i> We believe that this woman is a
former associate of Lehnsherr's. </i>

754
01:07:53,972 --> 01:07:57,474
They were together in Cuba
the day of the crisis in '62.

755
01:07:58,193 --> 01:08:01,130
He was also implicated in
Kennedy's assassination.

756
01:08:02,865 --> 01:08:03,957
What about that thing?

757
01:08:04,341 --> 01:08:05,786
We do not know what that thing is sir.

758
01:08:06,089 --> 01:08:08,148
Actually we really don't
know what any of them are.

759
01:08:08,365 --> 01:08:09,131
Yes.

760
01:08:10,207 --> 01:08:11,441
Yes we do.

761
01:08:11,825 --> 01:08:12,849
They are mutants.

762
01:08:14,464 --> 01:08:18,104
He has the power to control metal.

763
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:21,506
Last I checked that's what most
of your weapons were made of.

764
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:25,315
And she can transform into anyone.

765
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,790
A general.

766
01:08:27,094 --> 01:08:28,126
A secret service man.

767
01:08:28,455 --> 01:08:30,029
Even you Mr. president.

768
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:33,485
She can walk into this office
and order a nuclear strike

769
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:35,168
if she was in the mood.

770
01:08:35,816 --> 01:08:37,421
And that's only two of them.

771
01:08:37,675 --> 01:08:40,246
Well do we have any countermeasures
any defense?

772
01:08:40,385 --> 01:08:42,001
I was waiting for you to
ask me that question.

773
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:47,150
That's an experimental program sir.
Strictly off the books.

774
01:08:55,822 --> 01:08:58,757
You're telling me these
mutants are out in the world

775
01:08:58,856 --> 01:09:01,447
and our best defense are
these giant metal robots?

776
01:09:01,548 --> 01:09:03,641
Many of the mutants looks like us.

777
01:09:03,993 --> 01:09:06,018
My sentinels can tell the difference.

778
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,535
I have 8 prototypes ready to go

779
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:12,650
they're built out of a space age polymer
not an ounce of metal on them.

780
01:09:19,142 --> 01:09:20,512
I wanna make a demonstration

781
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:23,084
I want the world
to know that we can protect them.

782
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:24,932
What do you need to get
these things operational?

783
01:09:25,025 --> 01:09:26,573
I already gave that number to congress

784
01:09:26,921 --> 01:09:29,372
unfortunately they elected to shut me down.

785
01:09:29,686 --> 01:09:32,343
It's going to cost a bit
more to turn them on.

786
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:33,198
Whatever you need.

787
01:09:33,331 --> 01:09:36,728
Oh and one more thing
if we do manage to capture them

788
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,049
I would like her for
research purposes of course.

789
01:09:47,045 --> 01:09:48,145
How terrible?

790
01:09:49,945 --> 01:09:51,245
What?

791
01:09:51,445 --> 01:09:53,245
I mean, to be like that?

792
01:09:53,445 --> 01:09:54,110
Like that?

793
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:57,110
Can you imagine?

794
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,710
How can she even look in the mirror?

795
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:03,310
Yes, I can.

796
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,010
From where did she come from?

797
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,210
You think she has any family?

798
01:10:13,163 --> 01:10:15,890
Yes, she does.

799
01:11:04,077 --> 01:11:08,070
If I see so much as a screw
I will jam this into your throat.

800
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:10,537
How did you find me?

801
01:11:10,984 --> 01:11:12,008
You taught me well.

802
01:11:12,692 --> 01:11:14,751
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

803
01:11:16,226 --> 01:11:17,466
I missed you.

804
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:19,152
You tried to kill me.

805
01:11:19,706 --> 01:11:21,301
So the rest of us could live.

806
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:24,621
What do you mean?

807
01:11:25,168 --> 01:11:27,253
I received a message from the future.

808
01:11:27,389 --> 01:11:29,084
Don't lie to me.

809
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,710
I never have
and I never will.

810
01:11:33,734 --> 01:11:35,780
Humans use your
blood, your genes to

811
01:11:35,805 --> 01:11:38,077
create a weapon that
wipes us all out.

812
01:11:38,838 --> 01:11:41,834
I was only doing what I thought
necessary to secure our future.

813
01:11:41,975 --> 01:11:45,147
So what's to stop me from killing you
right now and securing my future?

814
01:11:46,615 --> 01:11:47,313
Nothing.

815
01:11:49,058 --> 01:11:50,274
It doesn't matter anymore.

816
01:11:50,836 --> 01:11:53,718
They have your DNA
your blood was on the street.

817
01:11:54,658 --> 01:11:55,818
Whose fault was that?

818
01:11:57,529 --> 01:11:58,238
Mine.

819
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:01,388
I've seen their plans.

820
01:12:01,894 --> 01:12:03,321
They are creating a weapon

821
01:12:03,411 --> 01:12:06,799
and now they have what they
need to take it further.

822
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:12,011
We have to strike now while
we still hold the upper hand.

823
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:16,628
I've seen too many friends die Eric.

824
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:20,536
I don't want a war.

825
01:12:21,591 --> 01:12:23,302
I only want the man who murdered them.

826
01:12:23,345 --> 01:12:24,405
This is war.

827
01:12:26,626 --> 01:12:27,684
What happened to you?

828
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,725
Did you lose your way
when I was gone?

829
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,572
Are you still Charles's Raven?

830
01:12:37,873 --> 01:12:39,841
Or are you Mystique?

831
01:12:43,786 --> 01:12:45,845
Trask is the enemy.

832
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,209
Killing one man isn't enough.

833
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:50,996
It never was for you.

834
01:12:52,464 --> 01:12:53,338
Good bye Erik.

835
01:13:19,215 --> 01:13:20,147
What happened?

836
01:13:20,347 --> 01:13:20,988
Come on, up

837
01:13:20,989 --> 01:13:21,956
Can he walk?

838
01:13:22,151 --> 01:13:23,118
He needs his treatment.

839
01:13:23,609 --> 01:13:25,127
Hank I can hear them.

840
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,671
It's ok
I'll make it stop. I'll get it

841
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,095
hey
hey. Pull yourself together

842
01:13:32,681 --> 01:13:33,884
it's not over yet.

843
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:39,690
You don't believe that?

844
01:13:41,204 --> 01:13:42,171
How do you know?

845
01:13:42,345 --> 01:13:43,403
As these go

846
01:13:46,175 --> 01:13:48,650
this comes back.

847
01:13:50,146 --> 01:13:51,915
They all come back.

848
01:13:57,494 --> 01:13:58,345
Look

849
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:00,872
I'm still here.

850
01:14:02,225 --> 01:14:03,707
She's still out there.

851
01:14:06,095 --> 01:14:07,484
But we need your help Charles.

852
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:10,532
Not like this I need you.

853
01:14:10,857 --> 01:14:12,138
We can't find Raven..

854
01:14:12,403 --> 01:14:13,403
..Not without your powers.

855
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:20,273
I added a little extra
cause you missed a dose.

856
01:14:25,678 --> 01:14:26,667
Charles.

857
01:14:58,147 --> 01:14:59,697
Hank do me a favour.

858
01:15:01,117 --> 01:15:02,832
Would you help me to my study please.

859
01:15:08,177 --> 01:15:09,685
Come on, ok

860
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,931
Are you sure about this?

861
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:25,226
Absolutely not.

862
01:15:32,533 --> 01:15:34,570
This creature is extraordinary.

863
01:15:36,052 --> 01:15:38,803
Her genes could hold the
key to mutation itself.

864
01:15:39,813 --> 01:15:40,837
I need more.

865
01:15:41,055 --> 01:15:44,024
That's all they were able to scrape off
the pavement in Paris.

866
01:15:44,094 --> 01:15:45,187
More than blood.

867
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,066
I need brain tissue.

868
01:15:47,753 --> 01:15:48,879
Spinal fluid.

869
01:15:49,772 --> 01:15:50,864
Bone marrow.

870
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:55,763
Imagine sentinels that could transform
adapt to any target.

871
01:15:56,455 --> 01:15:57,943
If I just get my hands on her.

872
01:15:58,241 --> 01:16:03,974
This girl could lead the program
forward, years, decades into the future.

873
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:06,845
How old is your son now Major?

874
01:16:08,217 --> 01:16:08,890
Jason?

875
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,478
He's coming up on 10 now
if you can believe it.

876
01:16:11,614 --> 01:16:13,048
8 years from fighting age.

877
01:16:13,447 --> 01:16:16,818
And how many of our sons and brothers did
we just ship home in body bags?

878
01:16:17,193 --> 01:16:19,055
Maybe 50? 55,000?

879
01:16:19,228 --> 01:16:20,945
How many more in the other side?

880
01:16:22,307 --> 01:16:23,245
Never before

881
01:16:24,299 --> 01:16:26,284
in all of human history

882
01:16:27,511 --> 01:16:31,504
has there been a cause which
could unite us as a species?

883
01:16:33,009 --> 01:16:34,447
Until now.

884
01:16:36,794 --> 01:16:38,853
You really hate mutants doctor don't you?

885
01:16:38,975 --> 01:16:43,912
On the contrary I rather admire
them the things they can do.

886
01:16:45,188 --> 01:16:47,847
I see mutants as our salvation.

887
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:49,474
And common enemy.

888
01:16:50,193 --> 01:16:53,333
Common struggle against the ultimate enemy.

889
01:16:54,191 --> 01:16:55,591
Extinction.

890
01:16:56,514 --> 01:16:59,923
I believe our new friends are going
to help us usher-in a new era bill.

891
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:05,038
A new era of genuine and
long lasting peace.

892
01:17:19,188 --> 01:17:20,932
<i> Attention! Attention! </i>

893
01:17:20,953 --> 01:17:23,158
<i> Transport departure in 2 hours. </i>

894
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:23,675
<i> Repeat. </i>

895
01:17:23,712 --> 01:17:26,784
<i> Transport departure in 2 hours. </i>

896
01:17:33,642 --> 01:17:35,385
When was the last time you were down here?

897
01:17:36,138 --> 01:17:38,934
- Last time we went looking for students.
- A life time ago.

898
01:17:45,948 --> 01:17:47,074
<i>Welcome professor.</i>

899
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,701
Raven is wounded
she won't be moving fast.

900
01:18:22,169 --> 01:18:24,399
These are muscles I haven't
stretched in a long time.

901
01:18:44,989 --> 01:18:45,926
Gosh!

902
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:54,422
<i>- No!
- Who are you?</i>

903
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:12,339
Charles!

904
01:19:20,542 --> 01:19:21,969
Charles it's alright.

905
01:19:25,681 --> 01:19:27,546
I'll go check the generator.

906
01:19:35,591 --> 01:19:37,456
It's not the machinery
is it?

907
01:19:37,659 --> 01:19:40,838
- I can't do this my mind...
- Yes, you can.

908
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:42,861
- It won't take it.
- It's just a little rusty.

909
01:19:43,052 --> 01:19:45,092
You do not understand
it's not a question of being rusty.

910
01:19:45,166 --> 01:19:47,089
I can flip the switches
I can turn the knobs.

911
01:19:47,231 --> 01:19:49,626
But my power comes from here
comes from ..

912
01:19:51,424 --> 01:19:52,448
And it's broken.

913
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,298
I feel like one of my students.

914
01:19:56,351 --> 01:19:57,340
Helpless.

915
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:02,103
It was a mistake coming down here.
It was a mistake freeing Eric.

916
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:04,295
This whole thing has
been one bloody mistake.

917
01:20:04,449 --> 01:20:06,922
I'm sorry Logan
but they sent back the wrong man.

918
01:20:07,623 --> 01:20:08,647
You're right.

919
01:20:10,626 --> 01:20:11,615
I am.

920
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,512
Actually it was supposed to be you.

921
01:20:15,664 --> 01:20:18,035
But I was the only one who could
physically make the trip.

922
01:20:20,031 --> 01:20:22,703
And ah I don't know how long I've got here.

923
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:25,854
But I do know that a long time ag..

924
01:20:26,599 --> 01:20:28,557
actually a long time from now.

925
01:20:29,578 --> 01:20:32,114
I was your most helpless student.

926
01:20:33,104 --> 01:20:35,442
And you unlocked my mind.

927
01:20:35,651 --> 01:20:39,755
You showed me what I was
you showed me what I could be.

928
01:20:40,556 --> 01:20:42,364
I don't know how to do that for you

929
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:43,876
you're right
I don't.

930
01:20:46,595 --> 01:20:47,827
But I know someone who might.

931
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:52,889
Look into my mind.

932
01:20:53,702 --> 01:20:55,313
You saw what I did to cerebro.

933
01:20:56,114 --> 01:20:57,459
You don't want me inside your head.

934
01:20:57,475 --> 01:21:00,128
There's no damage you can do.
That has already been done trust me.

935
01:21:12,654 --> 01:21:13,220
Hey.

936
01:21:15,963 --> 01:21:17,538
- Hey Logan.
- Hey Jean.

937
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:19,973
- Kill me.
- I love you.

938
01:21:23,084 --> 01:21:24,894
You poor..

939
01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:28,244
..poor man.

940
01:21:28,355 --> 01:21:28,862
Look past me.

941
01:21:28,928 --> 01:21:33,795
No I don't want your suffering!
I don't want your future!

942
01:21:33,879 --> 01:21:35,415
Look past my future.

943
01:21:35,961 --> 01:21:37,451
Look for your future.

944
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:42,525
That's it.

945
01:21:43,585 --> 01:21:44,491
That's it.

946
01:21:46,099 --> 01:21:46,803
That's it.

947
01:22:35,752 --> 01:22:37,218
Charles.

948
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,914
Charles.

949
01:22:45,246 --> 01:22:46,979
So this is what becomes of us?

950
01:22:48,879 --> 01:22:50,026
Erik was right.

951
01:22:51,405 --> 01:22:53,328
Humanity does this to us.

952
01:22:53,529 --> 01:22:55,929
Not if we show them a better path.

953
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,829
You still believe?

954
01:22:58,912 --> 01:23:01,589
Just because someone stumbles
loses their way

955
01:23:02,055 --> 01:23:04,154
it doesn't mean they're lost forever.

956
01:23:05,233 --> 01:23:08,727
Sometimes we all need a little help.

957
01:23:10,138 --> 01:23:11,720
Oh I'm not the man I was.

958
01:23:14,108 --> 01:23:15,249
I opened my mind

959
01:23:16,623 --> 01:23:18,999
it almost overwhelms me.

960
01:23:19,248 --> 01:23:20,178
You're afraid.

961
01:23:20,975 --> 01:23:23,181
And cerebro knows it.

962
01:23:23,783 --> 01:23:25,489
All those voices..

963
01:23:28,189 --> 01:23:32,683
So..... much...... pain.

964
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:35,220
It's not their pain you're afraid of.

965
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,665
It's yours Charles.

966
01:23:39,877 --> 01:23:42,036
And as frightening as it may be

967
01:23:42,615 --> 01:23:44,624
that pain will make you stronger.

968
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:48,144
If you allow yourself to feel it

969
01:23:48,975 --> 01:23:50,625
embrace it.

970
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:55,431
It will make you more powerful
than you've ever imagined.

971
01:23:56,151 --> 01:23:59,439
It's the greatest gift we have

972
01:23:59,807 --> 01:24:02,947
to bear their pain without breaking.

973
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,383
And it's born from the most human power

974
01:24:09,063 --> 01:24:09,862
hope.

975
01:24:20,008 --> 01:24:20,961
Please

976
01:24:21,563 --> 01:24:25,461
Charles we need you to hope again.

977
01:24:34,494 --> 01:24:36,438
Find what you were looking for?

978
01:24:42,684 --> 01:24:43,751
Power is back on.

979
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:44,795
Yes.

980
01:24:46,545 --> 01:24:47,600
Yes it is.

981
01:26:28,202 --> 01:26:30,102
She's lost too much blood.

982
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:33,545
- She can't keep going like this
- we have no choice Bobby.

983
01:26:34,394 --> 01:26:35,323
We can wake him up.

984
01:26:35,388 --> 01:26:36,078
No.

985
01:26:37,356 --> 01:26:38,544
They need more time.

986
01:26:39,218 --> 01:26:43,880
I had a glimpse into the past

987
01:26:43,995 --> 01:26:48,831
if we wake Logan now we may set off an
even darker course.

988
01:26:49,004 --> 01:26:50,465
They need more time.

989
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:12,080
Raven stop.

990
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:13,797
Stop running.

991
01:27:14,787 --> 01:27:15,544
Charles.

992
01:27:17,922 --> 01:27:18,909
Where are you?

993
01:27:19,187 --> 01:27:20,219
Back at the house.

994
01:27:20,408 --> 01:27:21,955
..Where you should be.

995
01:27:22,287 --> 01:27:24,428
I need you to come home.

996
01:27:25,058 --> 01:27:26,777
I know what I need to do.

997
01:27:31,005 --> 01:27:31,845
If you kill Trask

998
01:27:31,903 --> 01:27:34,059
you will be creating
countless more just like him.

999
01:27:34,567 --> 01:27:35,770
Then I'll kill them too.

1000
01:27:35,955 --> 01:27:38,139
Those are Erick's works not yours.

1001
01:27:42,076 --> 01:27:44,558
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing

1002
01:27:44,752 --> 01:27:48,173
she was good, fair,
full of compassion.

1003
01:27:49,507 --> 01:27:52,414
I have compassion
just not for Trask.

1004
01:27:52,614 --> 01:27:54,410
<i>He's murdered too many of us. </i>

1005
01:27:58,789 --> 01:28:00,317
Shut her down Charles
get in her head.

1006
01:28:00,781 --> 01:28:02,853
She's not letting me in
I'm barely holding on.

1007
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:04,949
I'm not strong enough yet.

1008
01:28:13,464 --> 01:28:15,106
I know what Trask has done.

1009
01:28:16,048 --> 01:28:18,073
But
killing him will not bring them back.

1010
01:28:18,937 --> 01:28:21,876
It will set you on a path from which
there is no return

1011
01:28:22,741 --> 01:28:26,462
an endless cycle of
killing us and them

1012
01:28:26,633 --> 01:28:28,172
till there is nothing left.

1013
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:31,636
But we can stop it right now.

1014
01:28:31,836 --> 01:28:32,836
You and I.

1015
01:28:34,318 --> 01:28:36,596
<i> You just have to come home. </i>

1016
01:28:38,456 --> 01:28:39,489
I have to .

1017
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:42,517
You haven't changed at all
Charles.

1018
01:28:43,394 --> 01:28:44,610
<i> Like I said. </i>

1019
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:46,820
I know exactly what I have to do.

1020
01:29:02,446 --> 01:29:03,182
Where is she?

1021
01:29:03,874 --> 01:29:06,056
At an airport boarding a plane.

1022
01:29:06,295 --> 01:29:07,963
Plane to where?

1023
01:29:10,521 --> 01:29:12,192
Washington DC.

1024
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,204
Hey guys

1025
01:29:15,973 --> 01:29:18,223
there is something I need to show you.

1026
01:29:19,951 --> 01:29:21,759
<i>We're going backwards in time.</i>

1027
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:25,197
This the system I designed to
record any news about Paris

1028
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,761
over all 3 networks and pbs.

1029
01:29:28,274 --> 01:29:29,984
All 3? Wow

1030
01:29:30,305 --> 01:29:31,938
yeah and pbs.

1031
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:34,175
Look what I found.

1032
01:29:34,512 --> 01:29:37,740
Tomorrow in front of the white house the
president will make his announcement .

1033
01:29:37,977 --> 01:29:40,338
He'll be joined by secretary
of defense Blair.

1034
01:29:40,421 --> 01:29:43,862
And has even sought the help of
renowned scientist Bolivar Trask.

1035
01:29:44,053 --> 01:29:46,695
<i>His special adviser to combat
this mutant issue. </i>

1036
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:48,404
<i> The White house is.... </i>

1037
01:29:48,767 --> 01:29:51,048
Raven doesn't realize but
if she kills Trask at

1038
01:29:51,061 --> 01:29:53,352
an event like that with
the whole world watching

1039
01:29:55,399 --> 01:29:57,280
then I came a long way for nothing.

1040
01:29:58,402 --> 01:30:00,567
And there's more bad news
I saw in a report.

1041
01:30:00,835 --> 01:30:02,789
They found traces of her blood in Paris.

1042
01:30:02,951 --> 01:30:05,501
<i>For all we know they
already have her DNA .</i>

1043
01:30:05,991 --> 01:30:06,881
<i> She's all they need </i>

1044
01:30:07,081 --> 01:30:08,908
to create the sentinels in the future.

1045
01:30:12,693 --> 01:30:15,899
Now there's a theory in Quantum
physics that time is immutable.

1046
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:19,025
It's like a river you can
throw a pebble into it

1047
01:30:19,038 --> 01:30:21,323
create a ripple but the current
always corrects itself.

1048
01:30:22,526 --> 01:30:26,248
No matter what you do the river just
keeps flowing in the same direction.

1049
01:30:26,905 --> 01:30:28,079
What are you trying to say?

1050
01:30:28,432 --> 01:30:29,560
What I'm saying is..

1051
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:31,768
What if the war is inevitable.

1052
01:30:32,194 --> 01:30:33,993
What if she's meant to kill Trask.

1053
01:30:35,539 --> 01:30:37,987
What if this is just simply who she is.

1054
01:30:40,411 --> 01:30:43,711
Just because someone stumbles,
loses their way.

1055
01:30:44,515 --> 01:30:46,297
Doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1056
01:30:51,455 --> 01:30:53,424
No, I don't believe that theory Hank.

1057
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:57,486
And I can not believe that who she is.

1058
01:30:59,898 --> 01:31:02,397
Ready the plane
we're going to Washington.

1059
01:32:21,278 --> 01:32:22,208
You alright ?

1060
01:32:22,446 --> 01:32:23,504
Getting there.

1061
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:31,319
Whatever happens today
I need you to promise me something.

1062
01:32:32,322 --> 01:32:35,348
You looked into my mind and you've seen
a lot of bad but

1063
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:37,605
you've seen the good too.

1064
01:32:38,987 --> 01:32:39,783
The X-Men.

1065
01:32:41,859 --> 01:32:43,221
Promise me you'll find us.

1066
01:32:45,369 --> 01:32:47,347
Use your power
bring us together.

1067
01:32:47,977 --> 01:32:49,646
Guide us. Lead us.

1068
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:52,419
Storm

1069
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:54,052
Scott

1070
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,530
Jean.

1071
01:32:59,349 --> 01:33:00,686
Remember those names.

1072
01:33:02,352 --> 01:33:03,621
There's so many of us.

1073
01:33:05,322 --> 01:33:07,483
We will need you professor.

1074
01:33:10,427 --> 01:33:12,832
I will do my best.

1075
01:33:13,297 --> 01:33:14,355
Your best is enough.

1076
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:17,720
Trust me.

1077
01:33:42,713 --> 01:33:44,978
12 carriers inbound 10 miles.

1078
01:33:46,442 --> 01:33:47,850
They found us.

1079
01:34:04,293 --> 01:34:06,683
<i> Thousands of people will
be gathered here today</i>

1080
01:34:06,696 --> 01:34:09,097
<i>they've come from all over the
world to witness history </i>

1081
01:34:09,159 --> 01:34:12,694
along with news crews from
at least 50 different countries.

1082
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:14,980
Thank you.

1083
01:34:18,068 --> 01:34:19,610
Can I see your invitations please?

1084
01:34:20,309 --> 01:34:21,520
Yes you may..

1085
01:34:21,629 --> 01:34:22,840
These two are with me.

1086
01:34:23,066 --> 01:34:24,055
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

1087
01:34:31,758 --> 01:34:32,482
<i> Logan. </i>

1088
01:34:33,138 --> 01:34:34,486
Please this way sir.

1089
01:34:59,398 --> 01:35:00,298
It's fine...

1090
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:03,496
I haven't found her yet
but she has to be here.

1091
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:05,493
<i> President of the United States. </i>

1092
01:35:28,032 --> 01:35:29,409
My fellow Americans

1093
01:35:30,101 --> 01:35:34,561
<i> today we face the greatest
threat in our history. </i>

1094
01:35:34,897 --> 01:35:35,648
Mutants.

1095
01:35:36,233 --> 01:35:37,232
<i>I'm pregnant..</i>

1096
01:35:39,108 --> 01:35:41,186
We have prepared for this threat.

1097
01:35:44,507 --> 01:35:47,382
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer.

1098
01:35:48,257 --> 01:35:49,350
Behold..

1099
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:52,928
The world will never be the same again.

1100
01:36:23,446 --> 01:36:24,378
Can I help you?

1101
01:36:27,516 --> 01:36:28,596
No you can't.

1102
01:37:06,489 --> 01:37:07,460
Here they come.

1103
01:37:14,679 --> 01:37:16,327
<i>This for you brothers and sisters. </i>

1104
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:19,898
Raven.

1105
01:37:22,927 --> 01:37:24,053
I have her.

1106
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,039
Let me go Charles.

1107
01:37:27,964 --> 01:37:29,314
There. You see?

1108
01:37:29,741 --> 01:37:31,764
Secret service man
left to the stage.

1109
01:37:31,836 --> 01:37:32,797
- Got it.
- Go.

1110
01:37:53,669 --> 01:37:55,319
What the hell are you doing?

1111
01:37:55,401 --> 01:37:56,962
I didn't tell you to activate it.

1112
01:37:57,102 --> 01:37:57,866
I didn't.

1113
01:38:16,492 --> 01:38:18,356
Raven please listen to me.

1114
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:22,394
<i>We've been given a second
chance to define who we are.</i>

1115
01:38:25,122 --> 01:38:26,636
Don't do this.

1116
01:38:30,011 --> 01:38:32,172
Gentlemen you cannot pass this point.

1117
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:41,673
We can't stop that many.

1118
01:38:42,228 --> 01:38:42,706
No.

1119
01:38:43,116 --> 01:38:44,815
But we can slow them down.

1120
01:39:22,956 --> 01:39:24,728
Erik!

1121
01:40:00,265 --> 01:40:01,626
Moving through
moving through

1122
01:40:09,691 --> 01:40:10,800
Storm!

1123
01:40:47,683 --> 01:40:51,292
<i> Take us to def-con 3.
Mr. president we are code red. </i>

1124
01:40:51,363 --> 01:40:52,512
<i> What's our air defense readiness. </i>

1125
01:40:54,069 --> 01:40:55,470
<i> What the hell happened out there? </i>

1126
01:40:55,496 --> 01:40:56,382
I will fix it.

1127
01:40:56,802 --> 01:40:57,769
You said that before

1128
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:58,989
I wanted to make a statement.

1129
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:01,634
<i> Now the whole goddamn world knows
we can't protect them.</i>

1130
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:03,331
<i>I will fix it. </i>

1131
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:04,350
<i>You damn well better.</i>

1132
01:42:16,287 --> 01:42:17,254
Charles!

1133
01:43:06,059 --> 01:43:07,446
Is everybody okay?

1134
01:43:41,605 --> 01:43:42,622
Storm!

1135
01:43:46,501 --> 01:43:47,557
Behind you.

1136
01:44:31,969 --> 01:44:32,752
Now.

1137
01:44:56,492 --> 01:44:58,631
I'm probably not supposed to
ask this kind of a thing.

1138
01:44:58,864 --> 01:45:02,193
But in the future
do I make it?

1139
01:45:02,852 --> 01:45:03,546
No.

1140
01:45:05,945 --> 01:45:07,717
But we can change that right?

1141
01:45:19,578 --> 01:45:21,352
Do what you were made for.

1142
01:45:22,393 --> 01:45:23,629
Mutants.

1143
01:45:30,807 --> 01:45:31,746
Where are you?

1144
01:45:48,989 --> 01:45:51,421
I got this. Go.

1145
01:46:33,404 --> 01:46:34,615
Oh dear god
no.

1146
01:46:50,406 --> 01:46:52,543
So much for being a survivor.

1147
01:47:35,571 --> 01:47:36,823
One of them is in here.

1148
01:47:39,424 --> 01:47:40,336
<i>No! No! No! </i>

1149
01:47:40,426 --> 01:47:41,198
<i> Don't kill it. </i>

1150
01:47:41,477 --> 01:47:42,533
I need it alive.

1151
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:57,591
What the hell has happened?

1152
01:49:05,875 --> 01:49:08,079
You built these weapons to destroy us.

1153
01:49:09,014 --> 01:49:09,947
Why?

1154
01:49:14,498 --> 01:49:17,186
Because you're afraid of our gifts.

1155
01:49:17,969 --> 01:49:19,755
Because we are different.

1156
01:49:21,659 --> 01:49:25,509
Humanity has always feared that
which is different.

1157
01:49:25,595 --> 01:49:28,461
But I'm here to tell you
to tell the world.

1158
01:49:29,471 --> 01:49:31,530
You're right to fear us.

1159
01:49:32,122 --> 01:49:33,609
<i>We are the future.</i>

1160
01:49:34,316 --> 01:49:37,163
We are the ones who will
inherit this earth.

1161
01:49:37,524 --> 01:49:39,604
And anyone who stands in our way

1162
01:49:39,649 --> 01:49:43,654
will suffer the same fate as
these men you see before you.

1163
01:49:50,644 --> 01:49:54,033
Today was meant to be a
display of your power.

1164
01:49:54,343 --> 01:50:00,233
Instead I give you a glimpse of the
devastation my race can unleash upon yours.

1165
01:50:09,006 --> 01:50:12,099
<i>Let this be a warning to the world. </i>

1166
01:50:12,171 --> 01:50:15,451
<i> And to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there </i>

1167
01:50:15,748 --> 01:50:17,344
<i> I say this: </i>

1168
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:19,314
<i> No more hiding. </i>

1169
01:50:19,574 --> 01:50:21,498
<i> No more suffering. </i>

1170
01:50:22,483 --> 01:50:28,143
You have lived in a shadows in shame
and fear for too long. Come out.

1171
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:34,058
<i> Join me fight together in the
brotherhood of our kind. </i>

1172
01:50:34,349 --> 01:50:36,309
A new tomorrow.

1173
01:50:37,671 --> 01:50:39,757
..That starts today.

1174
01:50:46,522 --> 01:50:50,561
All those years wasted fighting each other
Charles

1175
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:57,461
to have a precious few of them back.

1176
01:51:36,436 --> 01:51:36,999
Mr. President.

1177
01:51:37,047 --> 01:51:38,787
Stand down! I said stand down!

1178
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:43,048
You want to make a statement?

1179
01:51:43,533 --> 01:51:45,303
<i> Kill me...Fine </i>

1180
01:51:45,727 --> 01:51:47,538
<i> but spare everyone else! </i>

1181
01:52:00,138 --> 01:52:02,267
Very heroic Mr. President.

1182
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:05,927
But you had no intention
of sparing any of us.

1183
01:52:06,884 --> 01:52:10,315
The future of our species begins now.

1184
01:52:14,693 --> 01:52:15,238
<i>Mutant</i>

1185
01:52:19,576 --> 01:52:20,524
<i>mutants</i>

1186
01:52:45,657 --> 01:52:46,891
you used to be a better shot.

1187
01:52:46,949 --> 01:52:48,590
Trust me
I still I'm.

1188
01:53:01,791 --> 01:53:03,402
Get out of my head Charles!

1189
01:53:03,657 --> 01:53:04,645
Raven

1190
01:53:05,274 --> 01:53:07,559
please do not make us the enemy today.

1191
01:53:07,573 --> 01:53:09,543
Look around you
we already are.

1192
01:53:09,605 --> 01:53:11,685
They not all of us.

1193
01:53:11,874 --> 01:53:13,629
All you've done so far

1194
01:53:13,668 --> 01:53:16,481
is save the lives of these men.

1195
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:19,770
You can show them a better path.

1196
01:53:23,512 --> 01:53:25,252
Shut her down Charles

1197
01:53:27,278 --> 01:53:30,879
I've been trying to control you
ever since the day we met.

1198
01:53:31,209 --> 01:53:33,236
And look what that's got us

1199
01:53:35,078 --> 01:53:38,309
everything that happens now

1200
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:40,456
is in your hands.

1201
01:53:45,326 --> 01:53:48,059
I have a faith in you Raven.

1202
01:55:26,886 --> 01:55:28,450
He's all yours Charles.

1203
01:55:56,755 --> 01:55:59,247
If you let them have me
I'm as good as dead.

1204
01:55:59,378 --> 01:56:00,389
You know that.

1205
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:02,484
I know.

1206
01:56:05,134 --> 01:56:06,466
Good-bye old friend.

1207
01:56:09,181 --> 01:56:10,614
Good-bye Erik.

1208
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:46,180
You sure you should let them go?

1209
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:48,520
<i> Yes. </i>

1210
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:51,159
<i> I have hope for them. </i>

1211
01:56:51,977 --> 01:56:54,071
<i> There's going to be a time Hank. </i>

1212
01:56:54,072 --> 01:56:55,900
When we're all together.

1213
01:57:00,002 --> 01:57:01,622
<i> What about Logan? </i>

1214
01:58:31,887 --> 01:58:34,212
Good morning Logan.
Late start. Hah hah ha.

1215
01:58:44,596 --> 01:58:46,764
<i> Have a good lunch time. Good job. </i>

1216
01:58:46,850 --> 01:58:48,789
- Thank you.
- Very good job.

1217
01:58:50,238 --> 01:58:51,163
<i> Storm. </i>

1218
01:59:22,575 --> 01:59:23,243
Jean.

1219
01:59:25,212 --> 01:59:26,061
Hi Logan.

1220
01:59:28,883 --> 01:59:29,940
Are you okay?

1221
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:33,073
You're here.

1222
01:59:34,217 --> 01:59:35,320
Where else would I be?

1223
01:59:38,666 --> 01:59:39,455
Woh.

1224
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:41,450
Easy pal.

1225
01:59:44,166 --> 01:59:45,402
Some things never change.

1226
01:59:47,956 --> 01:59:48,983
Good to see you Scott.

1227
01:59:51,349 --> 01:59:52,068
Ah ha.

1228
01:59:52,385 --> 01:59:53,456
See you later Jean.

1229
01:59:57,759 --> 01:59:58,724
Professor.

1230
01:59:59,796 --> 02:00:00,436
Logan.

1231
02:00:01,344 --> 02:00:02,425
Is everything alright?

1232
02:00:06,163 --> 02:00:06,587
Yeah.

1233
02:00:08,655 --> 02:00:10,067
Yeah I think it is.

1234
02:00:27,081 --> 02:00:27,910
You did it.

1235
02:00:28,618 --> 02:00:29,251
Did what?

1236
02:00:29,665 --> 02:00:31,333
Logan don't you have a class to teach?

1237
02:00:32,474 --> 02:00:33,181
A class?

1238
02:00:33,617 --> 02:00:34,670
To teach. What?

1239
02:00:35,053 --> 02:00:35,859
History.

1240
02:00:36,694 --> 02:00:37,367
History?

1241
02:00:39,097 --> 02:00:40,604
History I could use some help with that.

1242
02:00:41,206 --> 02:00:42,215
Help with what?

1243
02:00:42,866 --> 02:00:46,081
Pretty much everything after 1973.

1244
02:00:51,275 --> 02:00:53,834
I think the history I know
is little different.

1245
02:00:55,691 --> 02:00:56,985
Welcome back.

1246
02:01:00,233 --> 02:01:01,561
It's good to see you Charles.

1247
02:01:03,451 --> 02:01:04,496
It's good to see everyone.

1248
02:01:05,103 --> 02:01:06,009
Well

1249
02:01:07,309 --> 02:01:08,738
I had a promise to keep.

1250
02:01:10,596 --> 02:01:13,759
You and I have lot of catching up to do.

1251
02:01:14,774 --> 02:01:15,335
Yes.

1252
02:01:19,958 --> 02:01:21,707
What is the last thing you remember?

1253
02:01:27,122 --> 02:01:28,056
Drowning.

1254
02:01:37,253 --> 02:01:38,456
<i> The past </i>

1255
02:01:39,793 --> 02:01:42,649
<i> a new and uncertain world. </i>

1256
02:01:54,439 --> 02:01:57,072
<i> A world of endless possibilities. </i>

1257
02:01:59,339 --> 02:02:01,515
<i> And infinite outcomes. </i>

1258
02:02:03,308 --> 02:02:04,230
<i>Can we?</i>

1259
02:02:04,441 --> 02:02:05,615
<i>Oh he is alive!</i>

1260
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:07,075
<i>He is breathing</i>

1261
02:02:10,225 --> 02:02:13,189
<i> countless choices define our fate. </i>

1262
02:02:14,082 --> 02:02:18,831
<i> Each choice
each moment a ripple in the river of time.</i>

1263
02:02:19,261 --> 02:02:21,122
What do you want us to do with him
major striker?

1264
02:02:22,031 --> 02:02:25,114
<i> Enough ripples and you change the tide.</i>

1265
02:02:26,490 --> 02:02:27,598
I'll take him from here.

1266
02:02:27,888 --> 02:02:31,668
<i>For the future is never truly set.</i>
