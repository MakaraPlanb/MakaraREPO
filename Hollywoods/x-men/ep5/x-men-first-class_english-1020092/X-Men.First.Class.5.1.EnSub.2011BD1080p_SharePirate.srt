1
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,837
Mama!

2
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,597
Mama!

3
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,895
Mama!

4
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,963
Mother. What are you...

5
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,341
I thought you were a burglar.

6
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,302
I didn't mean to scare you, darling.
I was just getting a snack.

7
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,596
Go back to bed.

8
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,432
What's the matter?

9
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,893
Go on, back to bed.

10
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,438
I'll make you a hot chocolate.

11
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,399
Who are you?

12
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,947
And what have you done with my mother?

13
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:21,284
<i>My mother has never set foot
in this kitchen in her life.</i>

14
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>And she certainly never
made me a hot chocolate.</i>

15
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>Unless you count
ordering the maid to do it.</i>

16
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,270
You're not scared of me?

17
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,815
I always believed I couldn't be
the only one in the world.

18
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,276
The only person who was

19
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,403
different.

20
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,197
And here you are.

21
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,991
Charles Xavier.

22
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,579
Raven.

23
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,540
You're hungry and alone.

24
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,417
Take whatever you want.

25
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,004
We've got lots of food.
You don't have to steal.

26
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,923
In fact,

27
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,759
you never have to steal again.

28
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,400
Understand this, Erik...

29
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,362
These Nazis, I'm not like them.

30
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,994
Genes are the key, yes?

31
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,206
But their goals?

32
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,752
Blue eyes? Blond Hair? Pathetic.

33
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,884
Eat the chocolate.

34
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,928
It's good.

35
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,763
Want some?

36
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,059
I want to see my mama.

37
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,321
Genes are the key that unlocks
the door to a new age, Erik.

38
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,408
A new future for mankind.

39
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,578
Evolution.

40
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,747
You know what I'm talking about?

41
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,836
It's a simple thing I ask of you.

42
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,924
A little coin is nothing
compared to a big gate.

43
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,510
Is it?

44
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,980
<i>Ja.</i>

45
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,485
I tried, Herr Doctor.

46
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,865
I can't... I don't...

47
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,616
It's impossible.

48
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:14,291
The one thing I can say for the Nazis is
their methods seem to produce results.

49
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,170
I'm sorry, Erik.

50
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,433
Mama!

51
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,643
My darling.

52
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,645
How are you?

53
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,067
Here's what we're going to do.

54
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,362
I'm going to count to three...

55
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,325
and you're going to move the coin.

56
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,371
You don't move the coin,
I pull the trigger.

57
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,334
Understand?

58
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,837
One

59
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,422
Mama.

60
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,673
You can do it.

61
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,013
Two

62
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,267
Everything is all right.

63
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,701
Three.

64
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,933
Yes. Wonderful.

65
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,069
Excellent.

66
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,792
<i>Nein!</i>

67
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,198
Outstanding, Erik.

68
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,120
So we unlock your gift with anger.

69
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,541
Anger and pain.

70
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,795
You and me...

71
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,924
we're going to have
a lot of fun together.

72
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,375
Heterochromia.

73
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,546
A gentleman would at least
offer to buy me a drink first.

74
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,259
Norman, a pint of bitter for me
and a brandy for the lady, please.

75
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,862
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.

76
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,971
My name is Xavier. Charles Xavier.

77
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,264
- How do you do?
- Amy.

78
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,266
Heterochromia was
in reference to your eyes,

79
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,810
which I have to say are stunning.

80
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,562
One green, one blue.

81
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,814
It's a mutation.
It's a very groovy mutation.

82
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,482
I've got news for you, Amy.

83
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,109
You are a mutant.

84
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,863
First you proposition a girl,
and then you call her deformed.

85
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,115
How is that seduction technique
working for you?

86
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,358
I'll tell you in the morning.

87
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,494
No, seriously, though,
you mustn't knock it.

88
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,371
Mutation took us
from single-celled organisms

89
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,875
to being the dominant form
of reproductive life on this planet.

90
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,086
Infinite forms of variation
with each generation,

91
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,881
all through mutation.

92
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,842
Then let's reclaim that word.

93
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,473
- Mutant and proud.
- Chin-chin. Hey.

94
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,268
- I guess I have to buy my own drink.
- I'm sorry. One cola.

95
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,811
Charles here was just telling me

96
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,314
that I'm like one of the first
sea creatures that grew legs.

97
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,357
A tiny bit sexier.

98
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,402
I'm sorry. This is my sister, Raven.

99
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,778
- Hi.
- Amy.

100
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,406
- And what do you study?
- Waitressing.

101
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,454
Oh, look, you have heterochromia, too.

102
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,457
- Sorry, what?
- Look at her eye.

103
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,879
Right. Raven, get your coat, please.

104
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,048
Don't talk to me. You did that on purpose.

105
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,217
- I did not! Why would I do it on purpose?
- Yes, you did!

106
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,677
You know I can't control it sometimes
if I'm stressed or tired.

107
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,680
You seem to be doing
a perfectly good job right now.

108
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,557
- "Mutant and proud."
- What?

109
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,061
Or is it only with pretty mutations,
or invisible ones like yours?

110
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,729
But if you're a freak, you better hide.

111
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,981
You're being ridiculous.

112
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,150
I don't mean to sound like an old fart.

113
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,527
- Which you are.
- Sometimes.

114
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,405
But we've talked about this, Raven.

115
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,867
A small slip-up is one thing.
A big one does not bear thinking about.

116
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,376
"Mutant and proud."

117
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,005
"Mutant and proud"?

118
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,226
If only.

119
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,442
- Would you date me?
- Of course I would.

120
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,779
Any young man would be lucky
to have you. You are stunning.

121
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,030
Looking like this?

122
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,116
Like... What?

123
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,662
Blue?

124
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,293
- You're my oldest friend.
- I'm your only friend.

125
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,504
- Thank you for that.
- Well?

126
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,881
I'm incapable of thinking of you that way.

127
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,133
I feel responsible for you.

128
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,970
Anything else would just feel wrong.

129
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,613
- But what if you didn't know me?
- Unfortunately, I do know you.

130
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,016
I don't know what's gotten into you lately.

131
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,892
You're awfully concerned with your looks.

132
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,399
I'm sleepy. Will you read to me?

133
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,776
I can't. I have my thesis coming up.
I have to study.

134
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,738
Fine, read that.
Your thesis always sends me right off.

135
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,200
"To Homo neanderthalensis,
his mutant cousin, Homo sapiens,"

136
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,410
"was an aberration."

137
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,498
<i>"Peaceful cohabitation,
if ever it existed, was short-lived."</i>

138
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,000
<i>"Records show, without exception,"</i>

139
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,253
<i>"that the arrival of the mutated
human species in any region"</i>

140
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,505
<i>"was followed by the immediate extinction"</i>

141
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,258
<i>"of their less-evolved kin."</i>

142
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,517
Possession of that gold is illegal.

143
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,519
I should inform the police.

144
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,271
Let's not play this game.

145
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,357
Where did you get it?

146
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,275
A friend.

147
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,070
He recommended your bank most highly.

148
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,031
I see.

149
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,492
Do you know our terms, sir?

150
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,118
Yes.

151
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,039
And you should know mine.

152
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,294
This gold is what remains of my people.

153
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,797
Melted from their possessions.

154
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,882
Torn from their teeth.

155
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,842
This is blood money.

156
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,054
And you're going to help me find the
bastards responsible for it.

157
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,144
Don't touch that alarm.

158
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,901
I want Schmidt. Klaus Schmidt.

159
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,027
Where is he?

160
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,738
Our clients don't provide
addresses. We're not...

161
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,324
Not that sort of bank?

162
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,708
Metal fillings, eh?

163
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,792
Not gold.

164
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,294
Worried someone might steal them?

165
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,631
Argentina! Schmidt is in Argentina!

166
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,845
Villa Gesell! Please!

167
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,070
Thank you.

168
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,994
I would love to kill you.

169
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,292
So mark my words.

170
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,880
If you warn anyone I'm coming...

171
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,631
I will find you.

172
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,605
Another day at the office.

173
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,440
Is that Colonel Hendry?

174
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,858
The NATO guy?

175
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,401
Yeah.

176
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,737
Yes, it is.

177
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,239
Because that's three mob bosses,
the Italian ambassador

178
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,241
and the CEO of Lockheed.

179
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,202
They can't all be Communists.

180
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,746
This Hellfire Club,
it's got to be something else.

181
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,791
Do you see that?

182
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,002
Hello, girls.

183
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,087
Wow! Very nice.

184
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,174
What are you doing?

185
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,011
Using some equipment
the CIA didn't give me. Stay put.

186
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,099
- Colonel Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am.

187
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,269
Emma Frost. Sebastian Shaw's associate.

188
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,606
And where is Mr. Shaw?

189
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,068
We're having a party,
and here's the entertainment.

190
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,778
Come with me.

191
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,901
Hello, beautiful. How are you?

192
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,654
Hey, baby. You want to find a quiet place?

193
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,866
I am so sorry.
I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.

194
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,661
Excuse me.

195
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,392
You sure we can't get you a refill, Bob?

196
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,810
No.

197
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:27,898
So, I hear you blocked the proposal
to position Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

198
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,111
I expect you'll reconsider.

199
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,904
We've had this conversation.

200
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:38,117
You put our nukes in Turkey
or anywhere that close to Russia,

201
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,036
and you're looking at war.

202
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,621
Nuclear war.

203
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,238
I don't ask for favors, Colonel.

204
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,991
I express my expectations.

205
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,578
So, let me say it again.

206
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,831
I expect you'll reconsider.

207
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,834
The only thing I will reconsider

208
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,171
is having another glass
of that delicious champagne.

209
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,770
What the hell did you put in my drink?

210
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,040
<i>You're thinking of running. Hiding.</i>

211
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,042
<i>We'd find you, Hendry.</i>

212
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,962
<i>There's not a fortress in the world
that could keep us out.</i>

213
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,648
Magnificent. Isn't she, Bob?

214
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,903
Genetic mutation.
The evolution of the human genome.

215
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,447
Where's Azazel?

216
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,183
We don't want the Colonel to be late.

217
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,293
Comrade.

218
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,007
Missiles in Turkey
send a very clear message.

219
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,330
If we ever decide to fire them,

220
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,052
the Russian early-warning system
won't even have time to kick in.

221
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,846
This better be important, MacTaggert.

222
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,265
Whoa, slow down.

223
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,684
Are you smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.

224
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,060
Colonel Hendry was there.

225
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,979
He was there, McCone, in the Hellfire Club.

226
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,564
Colonel Hendry?

227
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,649
I agree with you, General.

228
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,234
I've reconsidered my position

229
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,696
and I now believe we should
put Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

230
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,947
Colonel Hendry is here.

231
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,367
So unless he magically traveled
3,000 miles in the last 10 minutes,

232
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,954
listen to me, I suggest
that you stop wasting my time.

233
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,290
Looks like Hendry
wants to start World War III.

234
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,876
I got bigger things to deal with
right now, MacTaggert.

235
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,461
Sir, I...

236
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,713
- God!
- Have you lost your mind?

237
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,007
So, now what?

238
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,678
We find an expert on genetic mutation.

239
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,934
<i>Professor of Genetics,
Charles Francis Xavier.</i>

240
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,647
So, how does it feel to be a professor?

241
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,690
Don't call me that.
You don't get to be called a professor

242
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,400
until you actually have
a teaching position.

243
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,527
I know, but it suits you.

244
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,320
Don't say that.
Do say, "Let's go have a drink."

245
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,656
- Let's go have a drink.
- Wonderful.

246
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,270
Afternoon, gentlemen.

247
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,396
Hot out there.

248
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,481
Beer, please.

249
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,257
- German beer.
- Of course.

250
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:07,469
Yes, it's Bitburger. You like it?

251
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,603
The best.

252
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,319
What brings you to Argentina?

253
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,365
The climate. I'm a pig farmer.

254
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,414
Tailor. Since I was a boy.

255
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,000
My father made
the finest suits in Dusseldorf.

256
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,046
My parents were from Dusseldorf.

257
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,673
What was their name?

258
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,508
They didn't have a name.

259
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,346
It was taken away from them...

260
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,972
by pig farmers...

261
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,516
and tailors.

262
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,422
Blood and Honor.

263
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,591
Which would you care to shed first?

264
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,635
We were under orders...

265
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,761
Blood then.

266
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,515
Freeze, asshole.

267
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,100
Come on, shoot.

268
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,789
Who... what are you?

269
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,087
Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.

270
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,809
And I'm looking for my creator.

271
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,607
Drink! Drink! Drink!

272
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,576
Yeah!

273
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,043
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

274
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,296
I need another drink.
And you need another cola.

275
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,006
- Congratulations, Professor.
- Thank you very much.

276
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,692
It's much harder than it looks, actually.

277
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,971
No, on your presentation.

278
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,515
You were at my presentation?
How nice of you. Thank you very much.

279
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,683
Moira MacTaggert.

280
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,810
- Charles Xavier.
- Do you have a minute?

281
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,022
For a pretty little bean
with a mutated MCR1 gene?

282
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,648
I have five.

283
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:11,570
I say "MCR1,"
you would say "Auburn hair."

284
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,988
It's a mutation.

285
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,782
It's a very groovy mutation.

286
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,076
Mutation, right,

287
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,288
took us from single-celled organisms
to the dominant form...

288
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,083
You know what? This routine may
go over great with the co-eds,

289
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,794
- but I'm here on business.
- What?

290
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,422
- I really need your help.
- All right.

291
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,967
The kind of mutations that you were
talking about in your thesis.

292
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,095
I need to know
if they may have already happened.

293
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,139
In people alive today.

294
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,945
Professor?

295
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,281
I think we should just talk
when you're sober.

296
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,565
Do you have any time tomorrow?

297
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,579
Something tells me you already know
the answer to your question.

298
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,503
This is very important to me, and
if I can help you, I will do my utmost.

299
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,712
Thank you.

300
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,593
Still drinking champagne, Bob?

301
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,637
I will pass.

302
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,640
Okay, well, so much for the pleasantries.

303
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,602
I was wondering who you told
about our little arrangement.

304
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,062
No one.

305
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,067
- He's telling the truth.
- Good.

306
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,361
Well, I guess we're done here.

307
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,988
Let's wrap things up, shall we?

308
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,870
I knew better than to trust you.

309
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,457
Now, you let me walk out of here
with my money,

310
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:51,628
or I will pull this pin, and we all die.

311
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,090
Go ahead. Pull it.

312
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,050
I'll do it, I swear to God.

313
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,103
No, you won't.

314
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:13,984
But I will.

315
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,208
You're one of them?

316
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,084
Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.

317
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,003
You want to guess what I can do?

318
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,089
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.

319
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,883
But that's the boring part.

320
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,720
The fun stuff is what I can do with it
once I've got it.

321
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,647
The advent of the nuclear age may have
accelerated the mutation process.

322
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,361
Individuals with extraordinary abilities
may already be among us.

323
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,487
Thank you very much.

324
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,114
MacTaggert, you really think
that some crackpot scientist

325
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:05,160
is going to make me believe in
sparkly dames and vanishing men?

326
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,330
You just bought yourself a one-way
ticket back to the typing pool.

327
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,831
This meeting is over.

328
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,377
Please sit down, Agent MacTaggert.

329
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,420
I didn't really expect you to believe me,

330
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,631
given that all you could think about
during my presentation was

331
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,093
what sort of pie they were serving
in the commissary.

332
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,178
It's apple pecan.

333
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,639
I haven't been entirely honest
with you, love. I'm sorry.

334
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,975
You see, one of
the many spectacular things

335
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,354
my mutation allows me to do
is that I can read your mind.

336
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,107
I've seen this before in a magic show.

337
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,111
Are you going to ask us to think of
a number between one and 10 now?

338
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,946
No, Agent Stryker. Although,

339
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,073
I could ask you about your son, William,

340
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,783
who you were thinking about,
which is very nice.

341
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,577
But I think I'd rather ask you
about the Jupiter missiles

342
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,746
America are currently placing in Turkey.

343
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,958
He's a goddamn spy.

344
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,752
You brought a goddamned spy
into this facility!

345
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,232
How's that for a magic trick?

346
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,529
Best I've ever seen.

347
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,157
I want them out of here.

348
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,076
And locked down
until I can figure out what to do.

349
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,329
My facility is off-site.

350
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,582
I'll take them.

351
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,835
I can't believe this.
You'd think the director of the CIA

352
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,045
would have a little more composure.

353
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,504
We should be going after Shaw right now.

354
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,049
But instead, he's out there
worrying about the wrong mutants.

355
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,675
What are we going to do, Levene?

356
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,720
Levene? Levene, what's wrong with you?

357
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,515
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

358
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,893
<i>I've just frozen him for a moment
because I'd like to talk to you.</i>

359
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,353
<i>It's good, isn't it?</i>

360
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,022
<i>I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw
as you are.</i>

361
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,942
<i>If you still want my help, meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage.</i>

362
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,154
I've always known that there
were people like you out there.

363
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,741
I've been the laughing stock
of this agency for years, but I knew it!

364
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,825
You are going to love my facility.

365
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,911
- That's going to have to wait.
- Why?

366
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,871
Agent MacTaggert has a lead
on Sebastian Shaw,

367
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,394
and if we don't move now,
apparently, we're going to lose him.

368
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,793
- What?
- Not only can he read minds,

369
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,378
he can communicate with them as well.

370
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,341
Moira and I have just had
a lovely conversation.

371
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,631
Yes, we did.

372
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,216
That is incredible!

373
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,053
But I cannot take you anywhere else
without permission from upstairs.

374
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,138
- Like to see one more magic trick?
- Okay.

375
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,641
- Get in the car.
- Good idea.

376
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,371
<i>Herr Doktor.</i>

377
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,794
Little Erik Lensherr.

378
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,004
He's here to kill you.

379
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,514
What kind of a greeting is that...

380
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,518
after all these years?

381
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,280
Emma.

382
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,532
We don't harm our own kind.

383
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,703
Now it's a party.

384
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,331
<i>This is the US Coast Guard.</i>

385
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,461
<i>Do not attempt to move your vessel.
Stay where you are.</i>

386
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,635
They have a telepath.

387
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:59,186
I've lost Shaw. I've lost Shaw.
There's something blocking me.

388
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,353
This has never happened to me before.

389
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,731
I think there's someone like me
on that ship.

390
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,400
- Like you?
- I'm sorry, a telepath.

391
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,320
This is incredible. I could actually
feel her inside my mind. I'm very sorry,

392
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,123
but I don't think I'm gonna be
much help tonight. You're on your own.

393
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,254
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus!

394
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,551
Get inside.

395
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,391
Stop, stop, stop.

396
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,187
Charles! Are you okay?

397
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,510
There's someone else out there.

398
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,568
There.

399
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,114
Time to go.

400
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,421
Let go!

401
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,674
You have to let it go!

402
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,676
You've got to put someone in the water
to help him.

403
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,929
Let it go! You have to let it go!

404
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,703
<i>You can't. You'll drown.
You have to let go.</i>

405
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,831
<i>/ know what this means to you,
but you're going to die.</i>

406
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:29,044
<i>Please, Erik, calm your mind.</i>

407
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,182
Get off me! Get off!

408
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,517
Calm down! Just breathe. We're here!

409
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,728
- Who are you?
- My name is Charles Xavier.

410
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,773
You were in my head.
How did you do that?

411
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:54,152
You have your tricks, I have mine.
I'm like you. Just calm your mind.

412
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,822
I thought I was alone.

413
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,617
You're not alone.

414
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,829
Erik, you're not alone.

415
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,103
Welcome to my facility.

416
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,854
My mission has been to investigate

417
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,024
the application of paranormal powers
in military defense.

418
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,026
Or offense.

419
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,320
This guy Shaw, Schmidt,

420
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,073
whatever you want to call him,
he's working with the Russians.

421
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,534
- We might need your help to stop him.
- Marvelous.

422
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,578
So we're to be the CIA's
new mutant division, yes?

423
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,872
Something like that.

424
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,547
It's a supersonic.
The most advanced plane ever built.

425
00:36:56,965 --> 00:37:00,051
You should see it in real life.
It's incredible.

426
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:04,055
Hank, these are the special new
recruits I was telling you about.

427
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,142
This is Hank McCoy, one of
our most talented young researchers.

428
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,895
How wonderful.
Another mutant, already here.

429
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,022
Why didn't you say?

430
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,232
Say what?

431
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,610
Because you don't know.

432
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,989
I am so, so terribly sorry.

433
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:27,245
- Hank?
- You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.

434
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,955
So, your mutation is what?

435
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,750
- You're super-smart?
- I'll say.

436
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,710
Hank here graduated Harvard
at the age of 15.

437
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,046
I wish that's all it was.

438
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,007
You're among friends now, Hank.

439
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,508
You can show off.

440
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,817
Splendid.

441
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,075
I'm sorry.

442
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,416
Ta-da!

443
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,549
You're amazing.

444
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,468
Really?

445
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,558
<i>"The presence of US missiles in Turkey"</i>

446
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,187
<i>"represents an unprecedented threat
to the people of the Soviet Union,"</i>

447
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,649
<i>warned Russian Foreign Minister Gromyko
earlier today.</i>

448
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,194
<i>But he was quick to insist
the Russians would not be the first</i>

449
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,488
<i>to initiate any military action.</i>

450
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,407
Yeah, we'll fix that
as soon as we get to Russia.

451
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,035
Unless the CIA find us first.

452
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,287
I'll take care of them, too.

453
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:57,252
If that telepath gets inside your head,
he won't be as much fun as I am.

454
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,212
Already in hand, my love.

455
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,807
The Russians

456
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,103
made me this.

457
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,316
So, what am I thinking?

458
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,160
I don't know.

459
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,040
I was thinking
that you are the most exquisite thing

460
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,750
I have ever seen in my life.

461
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,923
And that this needs ice.

462
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,176
Fetch me some.

463
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,553
There's a good girl.

464
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,041
I promised myself I'd find a cure
ever since I was a little boy.

465
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,545
You have no idea what I'd give to feel

466
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,213
- normal.
- Normal.

467
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,429
Charles has never understood.

468
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,349
He's different, but he's never had to hide.

469
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:39,646
Hank, this serum that you're making,
it doesn't affect abilities, right?

470
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,690
Just appearance. It normalizes it.

471
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:43,858
Yeah.

472
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,361
Do you think it would work on me?

473
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,907
I can look into it, if you'd like.
It's the least I can do

474
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,390
after asking you to come down here
with such a weird request.

475
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,205
I have to admit, usually when guys
ask me out, they're not after my blood.

476
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,834
Sorry. I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...

477
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,130
I was excited.
You know, the nature of your mutation.

478
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,300
If any genes hold the key
to changing appearance, it's yours.

479
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:13,680
Hank, you weren't being forward.
That's kind of what I meant.

480
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,765
No.

481
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,892
But I'm just sorry if you thought I was.

482
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,311
And I'm sorry that you weren't.

483
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,982
Go ahead. Take the blood.

484
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,245
Sorry. Did I hurt you?

485
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,541
Kinky.

486
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,380
By the way, if I looked like you,

487
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,048
I wouldn't change a thing.

488
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,405
From what I know about you,

489
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,787
I'm surprised you've managed
to stay this long.

490
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,790
What do you know about me?

491
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,043
Everything.

492
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,794
Then you know to stay out of my head.

493
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:30,923
I'm sorry, Erik,
but I've seen what Shaw did to you.

494
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,053
I've felt your agony.

495
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,514
I can help you.

496
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,731
I don't need your help.

497
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,983
Don't kid yourself.
You needed my help last night.

498
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,569
It's not just me you're walking away from.

499
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,491
Here you have the chance to be part
of something much bigger than yourself.

500
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,662
I won't stop you leaving. I could.

501
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,501
But I won't.

502
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,589
Shaw has got friends.

503
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,759
You could do with some.

504
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,559
Hank turned that radar installation
into a transmitter.

505
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,145
It's designed to amplify brainwaves

506
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,606
so it could enhance
your telepathic powers,

507
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,775
help us find other mutants
for our division.

508
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,944
What if they don't want
to be found by you?

509
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,529
Erik.

510
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,030
You decided to stay.

511
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:43,204
If a new species is being discovered,
it should be by its own kind.

512
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,748
Charles and I find the mutants. No suits.

513
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,720
First of all, that's my machine out there.

514
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,670
Second of all, and much more
importantly, this is Charles' decision.

515
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,630
Charles is fine with the
CIA being involved.

516
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,215
Isn't that right?

517
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,011
No. I'm sorry, but I'm with Erik.

518
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,223
We'll find them alone.

519
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,725
What if I say no?

520
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:09,188
Then good luck using your installation
without me.

521
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,912
I call it Cerebro.

522
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,957
- As in the Spanish for "brain."
- Yes.

523
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,419
Okay, so, the electrodes connect Charles
to the transmitter on the roof.

524
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,548
When he picks up a mutant,
his brain sends a signal through a relay

525
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,759
and then the co-ordinates
of their location are printed out here.

526
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,220
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

527
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,362
What an adorable lab rat
you make, Charles.

528
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,477
Don't spoil this for me, Erik.

529
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,980
I've been a lab rat.
I know one when I see one.

530
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:55,151
Okay, great.
Are you sure we can't shave your head?

531
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,320
- Don't touch my hair.
- Okay.

532
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,114
It's working!

533
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,511
For that, daddy-o, you get a private dance.

534
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,392
You cats know it's double for both, right?

535
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,311
No, that won't be necessary.
Although, I'm sure it'd be magical.

536
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,856
We were thinking more,
we'll show you ours

537
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,233
if you show us yours.

538
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,694
Baby, that is not the way it works
around here.

539
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,155
More tea, vicar?

540
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,574
Don't mind if I do.

541
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,704
My turn.

542
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,890
How would you like a job
where you get to keep your clothes on?

543
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,732
- Where to, fellas?
- Richmond, Virginia, please.

544
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,693
Right, so, you want the airport?
The station? What?

545
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,988
No, we were rather hoping
you would take us all the way.

546
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,531
That's a six-hour drive.

547
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,034
That will give us plenty of time to talk.

548
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,582
What does the government want
with a guy like Alex Summers?

549
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,709
I hope you're not planning
on putting him with others.

550
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,589
First guy I've ever met who
actually prefers solitary confinement.

551
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,350
Crazy, huh?

552
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,601
What?

553
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,644
You like fish. I like fish, too.

554
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,607
Maybe we should get a bite sometime,
talk about it?

555
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,361
I'd rather go out with the fish.

556
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,452
These fish?

557
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,473
- Excuse me, I'm Erik Lensherr.
- Charles Xavier.

558
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,475
Go fuck yourself.

559
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,372
- There's nothing on radar?
- Nothing.

560
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,416
- Sonar?
<i>- Nyet.</i>

561
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,377
Then we have a problem.

562
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,606
Beautiful, isn't it?

563
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,775
The reason we exist.

564
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,027
We are the children of the atom, my love.

565
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,529
We have a situation.

566
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,781
The telepath.

567
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,075
I shouldn't be able to feel him
at this distance.

568
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,578
It's like his reach is

569
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,745
amplified.

570
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,209
They're recruiting.

571
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,963
You go on to Russia. I'll handle them.

572
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,884
I can't stop thinking about
the others out there.

573
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,762
All those minds that I touched.
I could feel them.

574
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:39,185
Their isolation, their hopes,
their ambitions.

575
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,708
I tell you, we are at the start
of something incredible, Erik.

576
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,938
We can help them.

577
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,732
Can we?

578
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:49,195
Identification, that's how it starts.

579
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:53,991
And ends with being rounded up,
experimented on, eliminated.

580
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,868
Not this time.

581
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,204
We have common enemies.
Shaw, the Russians.

582
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,830
They need us.

583
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,415
For now.

584
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:08,380
We should think of code names.

585
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,071
We're government agents now,
we should have secret code names.

586
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,377
I want to be called Mystique.

587
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,262
Damn! I wanted to be called Mystique.

588
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,264
Well, tough. I called it.

589
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,560
And I'm way more mysterious than you.

590
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,356
Darwin, what about you?

591
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,650
Well, "Darwin" is already a nickname,

592
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,277
and, you know, it sort of fits.

593
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,737
Adapt to survive and all.

594
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,406
Check this out.

595
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,129
- That was incredible.
- Thank you.

596
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,676
- What about you?
- I'm going to be

597
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,760
Banshee.

598
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,637
Why do you want to be named
after a wailing spirit?

599
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,122
You might want to cover your ears.

600
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:17,825
- Your turn.
- My stage name is Angel.

601
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,161
- It kind of fits.
- You can fly?

602
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,163
And...

603
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,257
What's your name?

604
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,676
How about Big Foot?

605
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,138
You know what they say
about guys with big feet.

606
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,181
And yours are kind of small.

607
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:42,600
Okay, now.

608
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,853
Alex, what is your gift? What can you do?

609
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,647
It's not...

610
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,983
I just can't do it. I can't do it in here.

611
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,319
- Can you do it out there?
- Why don't you just do it out there?

612
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:57,031
- Come on!
- Alex! Alex! Alex!

613
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,454
That's the spirit!

614
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,623
Get down when I tell you.

615
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,541
"Get down when I tell you."

616
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,547
Get back.

617
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,095
Get back!

618
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,390
Whatever.

619
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:41,158
We have intel that Shaw is meeting with
the Russian Defense Chief in Moscow.

620
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,369
So go ahead. Say it.

621
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,871
I'm not here to say "I told you so."
You know why I'm here.

622
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,666
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Clearance to bring along your mutants.

623
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:52,169
Fight fire with fire. It makes sense.

624
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,171
Wait! You're okay with this?

625
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,007
Sending in a bunch of
untrained, unauthorized freaks?

626
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:01,595
These freaks are dedicated,
hardworking people.

627
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,181
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.

628
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,264
I'm telling you,
these kids are not ready for Shaw.

629
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,309
I think they're gonna surprise you.

630
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,644
They're an exceptional bunch
of young people.

631
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,770
What the hell?

632
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,781
Come on! You can go harder than that.

633
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,784
Harder!

634
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:25,536
Harder!

635
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,207
What are you doing?

636
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,715
Who destroyed the statue?

637
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,341
It was Alex.

638
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:40,718
No, Havok.

639
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,886
We have to call him Havok.
That's his name now.

640
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,724
And we were thinking,
you should be Professor X

641
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,976
and you should be Magneto.

642
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,478
Exceptional.

643
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,776
I expect more from you.

644
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,299
- We got a problem.
- What?

645
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,509
I'm so sorry. This wasn't on the map.

646
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,352
No matter what happens, act normally.
I'll take care of this, all right?

647
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,688
Now, listen to me...

648
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,235
- Where are you going?
- To our farm.

649
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,906
Open the back.

650
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,866
As you wish.

651
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,039
Easy, easy. Take it easy, chaps.

652
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,557
- Anything back there?
- Nothing. It's empty.

653
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,479
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

654
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,296
- Where is Shaw?
- I don't know.

655
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,675
But if she's a telepath and I read her,
she'll know we're here.

656
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,053
Let me try something else.

657
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,698
Shaw sends his apologies
but he's indisposed.

658
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,367
He asked me to come in his place.

659
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,705
And between you and I, honey,
I'm a lot better company.

660
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,914
Please, come in.

661
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,379
He's not coming.

662
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,092
So, what now, boss?

663
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,720
Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.
Mission aborted.

664
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,555
- The hell it is.
- Erik.

665
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,308
She's his right-hand woman.
That's good enough for me.

666
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,020
The CIA invading the home of
a senior Soviet official. Are you crazy?

667
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,230
I'm not CIA.

668
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,481
Erik!

669
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,236
Your health.

670
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,451
So, you must be busy
planning your next move.

671
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,787
What with the Americans refusing to
remove their missiles from Turkey.

672
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,375
You know I can't talk about
those things, Miss Frost.

673
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,502
Emma.

674
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,382
And don't worry.

675
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,093
You don't have to say a word.

676
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,277
He's gonna start
World War III single-handed.

677
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,947
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

678
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,365
- We're moving out.
- You can't!

679
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,508
I'm sorry. I can't leave him.

680
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,731
For God's sake, Erik! Be calm.

681
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,149
Be calm.

682
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,402
Forget my face.

683
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:21,915
You are beautiful, so beautiful! Yes!

684
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,209
Pathetic.

685
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,677
Yes!

686
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,805
Nice trick.

687
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,600
Who are you?

688
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:45,689
Go to sleep.

689
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,116
You can stop trying
to read my mind, sugar.

690
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,037
You're never going to get anything
from me while I'm like this.

691
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:15,385
So, then, you can just tell us.

692
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:19,848
Where is Shaw?

693
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,314
Erik.

694
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,030
Erik, that's enough.

695
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:44,790
Erik, that's enough!

696
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,009
All yours.

697
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,555
She won't be shifting
into diamond form again.

698
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,016
And if she does, just
give her a gentle tap.

699
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:32,295
<i>We are the children of the atom.</i>

700
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,298
<i>Radiation gave birth to mutants.</i>

701
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:39,761
<i>What will kill the humans
will only make us stronger.</i>

702
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,225
Beautiful, isn't it?

703
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,189
This is worse
than we previously imagined.

704
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,318
We're taking you with us.

705
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,487
CIA will want to question you themselves.

706
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,239
Oh, I doubt it.

707
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,409
They have bigger things
to worry about right now.

708
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,250
- Whoa!
- All right, all right.

709
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,335
Jesus, man, you are killing me.

710
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:15,505
Don't beat yourself up.
I've had a lot of spare time.

711
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,137
I didn't know the circus was in town.

712
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,764
Hey, come on, honey. Give us a little...

713
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,934
No? Come on, let's see the foot.

714
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,686
There it is. Come on, Big Foot, let's go.

715
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,105
Hey. Hey, come on. Hey.

716
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,486
They're just guys being stupid.

717
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,823
Guys being stupid, I can handle. Okay?
I've handled that my whole life.

718
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,367
But I'd rather a bunch of guys
stare at me with my clothes off

719
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:45,891
than the way these ones stare at me.

720
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,747
At us.

721
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,048
What was that?

722
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,802
I don't know. Something doesn't feel right.

723
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,021
No news of Shaw?

724
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:16,399
- Not a peep.
- Not even through that back channel?

725
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:29,996
What is that?

726
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,266
- We have an intruder in the main atrium.
- Where are the mutants?

727
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,102
If you take another step,
I'm gonna put you down.

728
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:55,438
Of course you will. But where do
I find the more evolved people?

729
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,607
Send back-up now!

730
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,863
Get back! Do not leave that room.
We're under attack!

731
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:05,949
Shoot! Shoot!

732
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:20,672
Where are the mutants?

733
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,216
Put that man down or we will open fire!

734
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,910
Stay here, my ass! Let's go!

735
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,127
- Get back!
- We can help! We can help!

736
01:04:58,853 --> 01:04:59,854
Wait!

737
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:01,773
You want the mutants?
They're right through that door.

738
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,234
Just let us normal people go.
We're no threat...

739
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,788
- Where is the telepath?
- Not here.

740
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,623
Too bad.

741
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,712
Well, at least I can take
this silly thing off.

742
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,798
Good evening. My name is Sebastian Shaw.

743
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:30,176
And I am not here to hurt you.

744
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,719
Freeze!

745
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:33,680
Azazel.

746
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:40,603
My friends, there is a revolution coming.

747
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:44,023
When mankind discovers who we are,
what we can do,

748
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,859
each of us will face a choice.

749
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,111
Be enslaved

750
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,197
or rise up to rule.

751
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,409
Choose freely,
but know that if you are not with us,

752
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,202
then, by definition, you are

753
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,121
against us.

754
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,166
So, you can stay

755
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,711
and fight for the people
who hate and fear you,

756
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,674
or you can join me and live like kings.

757
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,473
And queens.

758
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,737
- Angel.
- Are you kidding me?

759
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,448
Come on.

760
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,366
We don't belong here.

761
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,827
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

762
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,792
We have to do something.

763
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,936
Stop. I'm coming with you.

764
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,566
Good choice.

765
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,611
So, tell me about your mutation.

766
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,072
Well, I adapt to survive.

767
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,160
So, I guess I'm coming with you.

768
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,371
I like that.

769
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,045
- Alex!
- Get out!

770
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,546
Do it!

771
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,470
Protecting your fellow mutants?

772
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:39,806
That's a noble gesture.

773
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,975
Feels good.

774
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,399
Adapt to this.

775
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:35,361
Hello.

776
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:43,536
Once again, my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the CIA.

777
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,789
These Americans are ruthless.

778
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:52,503
Now they have their missiles
placed in Turkey...

779
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:57,759
I expect you'll be planning new missile
sites of your own.

780
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:04,474
Somewhere you know the American
early-warning system won't help.

781
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:09,103
I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year.

782
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,357
And so close to Florida.

783
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,651
Missiles in Cuba?

784
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,614
You're serious?

785
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:23,242
We may as well declare war.

786
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,371
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

787
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:31,250
You will make this happen.

788
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,337
Okay.

789
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,423
Let's see what KGB think about this.

790
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:45,515
Hello? General Armivolkoff.

791
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,187
It's nothing.

792
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,787
Raven?

793
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,628
We've made arrangements
for you to be taken home immediately.

794
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,255
- We're not going home.
- What?

795
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,632
He's not going back to prison.

796
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:20,883
He killed Darwin.

797
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,447
All the more reason for you to leave.

798
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,220
This is over.

799
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,305
Darwin's dead, Charles.

800
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,224
And we can't even bury him.

801
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,145
We can avenge him.

802
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,692
Erik, a word, please.

803
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:44,323
- They're just kids.
- No. They were kids.

804
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,742
Shaw has his army, we need ours.

805
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,916
We'll have to train.

806
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,627
All of us.

807
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,337
- Yes?
- Yeah.

808
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:01,048
Well, we can't stay here.

809
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:04,427
Even if they reopen the department,
it's not safe.

810
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,637
We've got nowhere to go.

811
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,349
Yes, we do.

812
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,311
The law says we've got to turn her over.

813
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,521
The law applies to human beings.

814
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:19,066
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're too dangerous.

815
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:23,279
In times like this,
security is more important than liberty.

816
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:26,032
- There is a war coming, John.
- Yes,

817
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,201
but a war with who?

818
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,383
Excellent question.

819
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,261
Though I wouldn't call it a war, exactly.

820
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,723
That suggests both sides stand
an equal chance of winning.

821
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,735
Captain, no sign of any American ships.

822
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,571
Maintain course, full ahead.

823
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:09,075
The Russians have sent
their warheads to Cuba.

824
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,327
We have a week
before the ship hits the coast.

825
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:15,540
Our fleet can be on this line
when the Russian missile ship arrives.

826
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:19,126
If that ship crosses the line,

827
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,255
they will have declared war
against the United States.

828
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,883
And we will have no choice but to
retaliate with a full nuclear response.

829
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,009
Do we agree?

830
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:35,226
Dispatch the 7th fleet.

831
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,813
This is yours?

832
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,107
No, it's ours.

833
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,993
Honestly, Charles. I don't know how
you survived, living in such hardship.

834
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,663
Well, it was a hardship softened by me.

835
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,251
Come on. Time for the tour.

836
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,141
Dear comrades...

837
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:21,939
The United States have dispatched
warships for Cuba.

838
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:26,944
This leaves us with no choice.

839
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,782
Comrade First Secretary...

840
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:35,244
We must send in our fleet.

841
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,915
Dispatch the fleet!

842
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,841
<i>President Kennedy
has signed a formal proclamation</i>

843
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:52,511
<i>setting up a blockade
of all missiles bound for Cuba.</i>

844
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,765
<i>The Soviet Union reacted by terming it</i>

845
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,769
<i>"A step along the road to unleashing
a thermo-nuclear war."</i>

846
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,697
You're sure?

847
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:13,949
I'm sure.

848
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,534
All right.

849
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,126
No. No, I can't. I'm sorry.

850
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,379
I can't shoot anybody point blank,
let alone my friend.

851
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,464
Oh, come on. You know I can deflect it.

852
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:29,924
You're always telling me
I should push myself.

853
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:35,179
If you know you can deflect it,
then you're not challenging yourself.

854
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:38,557
Whatever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine?

855
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:43,104
I can't. Something that big?
I need the situation, the anger...

856
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,772
No, the anger is not enough.

857
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,233
It's gotten the job done all this time.

858
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,402
It's nearly gotten you
killed all this time.

859
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,488
Come here.

860
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,532
Let's try something
a little more challenging.

861
01:14:56,242 --> 01:15:00,496
My stepfather took the possibility of
nuclear war quite seriously. This way.

862
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,707
That is why he had this bunker
built down here.

863
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:05,292
I thought we could use it
as a practice range of sorts.

864
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:07,253
You don't think I'm going to
blow through the walls?

865
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,547
He had this place built to
withstand a nuclear bomb.

866
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,048
I think it can handle you, Alex.

867
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:14,343
You know, when I do this,
bad things tend to happen.

868
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:18,514
That's because you can't control it.
It controls you.

869
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,058
That's why we're here, Alex.
It's why we're training.

870
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,816
What you're doing is incredible.
You're hitting a pitch with sound waves

871
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,527
that have the same resonant frequency
as the glass. That's why it shatters.

872
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,071
But this, it's like any other muscle
in the body.

873
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,115
You can control it.

874
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,286
"In each of us, two natures are at war."

875
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,163
Robert Louis Stevenson, <i>Jekyll and Hyde.</i>

876
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,247
Top marks.

877
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,291
The story wasn't really about
good and evil though, was it?

878
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,295
It was about man's animal nature
and his struggle to control it, to conform.

879
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:51,881
And it's that struggle
which is holding you back.

880
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:55,217
No, Jekyll was afraid of what
he could be capable of.

881
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,052
And you are, too.

882
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,472
If you're serious about me doing this,
you might want to get back.

883
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:00,973
All right.

884
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,017
- Shall I shut the door?
- Yeah.

885
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:08,397
Whenever you're ready.

886
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:15,946
Oh, my God!

887
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,827
I will teach you to control this, Alex.

888
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,416
And you're sure that this will work?

889
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,251
Anything is possible. I based the design...

890
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,670
Hank, stop talking. Come on.

891
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,839
Now, remember.
Scream as hard as you can.

892
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,841
You need the sound waves
to be supersonic.

893
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,125
Catch them at the right angle
and they should carry you.

894
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,429
They should carry me.

895
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:43,057
- That's reassuring.
- Good luck.

896
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,893
And don't forget to scream.

897
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:59,281
Now, if you want to beat me this time,
you have to set the beast free.

898
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,617
On your marks,

899
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,202
get set,

900
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:04,995
go!

901
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,387
Congratulations, my friend.

902
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,230
Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.

903
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,684
Impressive, Hank.

904
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,687
With feet like those,
all you need is a red nose.

905
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,521
Right, Bozo?

906
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,648
- I'm done here.
- Thank you, Alex.

907
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,109
Come on, Hank.

908
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,581
If you're using half your concentration
to look normal,

909
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,293
then you're only half paying attention
to whatever else you're doing.

910
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:56,046
Just pointing out something
that could save your life.

911
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,176
You want society to accept you,

912
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,930
but you can't even accept yourself.

913
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,354
Sexy!

914
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,898
Well, this is just the prototype.

915
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:15,441
The real one will look considerably better.

916
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,527
It will be a whole suit. See, these
sensors measure your energy output.

917
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,280
This panel focuses it
and the excess is absorbed.

918
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,294
Try hitting the one in the middle.
Just the one in the middle, mind.

919
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,035
Good luck.

920
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,048
You got to see this. Your genes are
extraordinary, you know that?

921
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,758
Your cells age at half the rate
of a normal human.

922
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:43,677
When you're 40, you'll still
have the leucocytes of a teenager.

923
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:48,140
You have the most incredible
cellular structure I've ever seen.

924
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,396
And you truly believe I'll fly this time?

925
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,814
Unreservedly.

926
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,566
- I trust you.
- I'm touched.

927
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,443
- I don't trust him.
- Say nothing.

928
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,196
I'm gonna die!

929
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,198
Look, we're not going to
make you do anything you don't feel...

930
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,491
Here, let me help.

931
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,369
Erik!

932
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,100
What?

933
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,851
You know you were thinking the same.

934
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,020
Wonderful work, Hank.
Thank you very much.

935
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,897
All right, Alex, I want you to hit the "X".

936
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,535
And try not to hit me. There's a good chap.

937
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:42,945
- You're serious?
- I'm very serious.

938
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,280
I have complete and utter faith in you.

939
01:19:58,585 --> 01:19:59,670
Am I still a bozo?

940
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,090
Yes, Hank, you're still a bozo.

941
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,383
But nice job.

942
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:08,721
See that?

943
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,557
Try turning it to face us.

944
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:35,581
You know, I believe that true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity.

945
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,251
Would you mind if I...

946
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,329
What did you just do to me?

947
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:20,501
I accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system.

948
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:25,506
It's a very beautiful memory, Erik.
Thank you.

949
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,175
I didn't know I still had that.

950
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,470
There is so much more to you
than you know.

951
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,556
Not just pain and anger.

952
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,225
There is good, too. I felt it.

953
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:39,478
When you can access all of that,

954
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,731
you'll possess a power no one can match.

955
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,317
Not even me.

956
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,571
So, come on. Try again.

957
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:31,697
- Hey!
- Well done.

958
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,782
The President is about to make his address.

959
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:39,997
<i>It shall be the policy of this nation
to regard any nuclear missile</i>

960
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,750
<i>crossing the embargo line
that surrounds Cuba</i>

961
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:48,046
<i>as an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States</i>

962
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:51,800
<i>requiring a full retaliatory
response upon the Soviet Union...</i>

963
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:54,261
- That's where we're going to find Shaw.
- How do you know?

964
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:58,015
Two superpowers facing off
and he wants to start World War III.

965
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,808
He won't leave anything to chance.

966
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,810
So much for diplomacy.

967
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,271
I suggest you all get a good night's sleep.

968
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,398
<i>Ultimately leads to war.</i>

969
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:11,695
<i>Tensions mount as
the Soviet missile ship nears Cuba.</i>

970
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:16,617
<i>All diplomatic efforts to avert
nuclear war have thus far failed.</i>

971
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:21,079
<i>As the American people ready themselves
for the likelihood of an atomic attack,</i>

972
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:24,541
<i>there are widespread reports
of panic-buying,</i>

973
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:29,004
<i>supermarkets cleared, as shelters
unused since the Second World War</i>

974
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:31,590
<i>are stocked for what may lie ahead.</i>

975
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:36,261
<i>In all its history,
America has never faced a greater threat.</i>

976
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,096
The world is primed for war

977
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,724
and there's no one to stop me.

978
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:46,772
Come in.

979
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:49,274
Hey.

980
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,027
I have a surprise for you.

981
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:04,039
I isolated the right marker
in your DNA sample.

982
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:05,958
The serum works like an antibiotic,

983
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:09,211
attacking the cells
that cause our physical mutation.

984
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,005
It won't affect our abilities,
just our appearance.

985
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,301
Do you still want to do this?

986
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,805
Should we have to hide?

987
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,058
Well, you already do.

988
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:26,103
You're hiding right now,
like I have my whole life.

989
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:30,190
I don't want to feel like a freak all
the time. I just want to look...

990
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,317
- Normal.
- Yeah.

991
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:40,659
Hank, don't!

992
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:45,038
You're beautiful, Hank.

993
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:47,332
Everything you are, you are perfect.

994
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,297
Look at all of us.
Look at all we've achieved this week.

995
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,382
All we will achieve.

996
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,011
We are different.

997
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,513
But we shouldn't be
trying to fit into society.

998
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,767
Society should aspire to be more like us.

999
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,813
Mutant and proud.

1000
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,611
It behooves me to tell you

1001
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:21,950
that even if we save the world tomorrow,
and mutants are accepted into society,

1002
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:25,454
my feet and your natural blue form

1003
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,497
will never be deemed beautiful.

1004
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,379
You look beautiful now.

1005
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,634
We need this cure.

1006
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,663
Cuba.

1007
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,332
Russia, America.

1008
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,334
It makes no difference.

1009
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,420
Shaw has declared war on mankind,
on all of us.

1010
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,505
He has to be stopped.

1011
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:19,633
I'm not going to stop Shaw.

1012
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:21,593
I'm going to kill him.

1013
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:27,349
Do you have it in you to allow that?

1014
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,440
You've known all along
why I was here, Charles.

1015
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:38,193
But things have changed.

1016
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:40,237
What started as a covert mission,

1017
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,031
tomorrow, mankind will know
that mutants exist.

1018
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:46,243
Shaw, us, they won't differentiate.

1019
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:47,911
They'll fear us.

1020
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,871
And that fear will turn to hatred.

1021
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,998
Not if we stop a war.

1022
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:55,377
Not if we can prevent Shaw.
Not if we risk our lives doing so.

1023
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:58,630
- Would they do the same for us?
- We have it in us to be the better men.

1024
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,674
We already are.

1025
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,384
We're the next stage of human evolution.

1026
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,511
- You said it yourself!
- No...

1027
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:06,388
Are you really so naive

1028
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:09,808
as to think that they won't
battle their own extinction?

1029
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:13,478
- Or is it arrogance?
- I'm sorry?

1030
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,939
After tomorrow,
they're going to turn on us.

1031
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:19,276
But you're blind to it, because
you believe they're all like Moira.

1032
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:21,653
And you believe they're all like Shaw.

1033
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:28,243
Listen to me very carefully, my friend.

1034
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:31,246
Killing Shaw will not bring you peace.

1035
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,500
Peace was never an option.

1036
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:23,006
No.

1037
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:25,884
No, no. No.

1038
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:56,706
Well,

1039
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,793
this is a surprise.

1040
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:01,545
The nice kind?

1041
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:07,008
Get out, Raven. I want to go to bed.

1042
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:09,553
Maybe in a few years.

1043
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:15,141
How about now?

1044
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,606
I prefer the real Raven.

1045
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:28,947
I said the real Raven.

1046
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,207
Perfection.

1047
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:45,338
Could you pass me my robe?

1048
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,841
You don't have to hide.

1049
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,638
Have you ever looked at a tiger

1050
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,600
and thought you ought to cover it up?

1051
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,477
No, but...

1052
01:29:59,686 --> 01:30:02,022
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

1053
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:06,067
All your life,
the world has tried to tame you.

1054
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,528
It's time for you to be free.

1055
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:31,509
You know, sometimes I wonder
what my life would have been like

1056
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,887
if you hadn't found me here that night.

1057
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,430
Sorry, what? You...

1058
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,476
For God's sake, Raven!

1059
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,811
Where are your clothes?
Put some clothes on.

1060
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,772
That's not what you said
when you first saw me.

1061
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:48,109
But I guess pets are always cuter
when they're little, right?

1062
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:50,153
Raven, I don't know
what's gotten into you lately.

1063
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,030
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

1064
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:58,036
Hank, he tells me that he's found
the answer to your cosmetic problem.

1065
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:02,296
Are you gonna tell me what's the matter
or do I have to read your mind?

1066
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,125
You promised me you would never do that.

1067
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:05,877
Until recently,

1068
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,797
I never had to use my power
to know what you were thinking, Raven.

1069
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,717
Charles, I used to think it was going
to be you and me against the world.

1070
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:16,137
But no matter how bad the world gets,
you don't want to be against it, do you?

1071
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:17,341
You want to be a part of it.

1072
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:41,079
What the hell happened here?

1073
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:51,339
Hank has been busy.

1074
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:53,591
Do we really have to wear these?

1075
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:56,428
As none of us mutated
to endure extreme g-force

1076
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,764
or being riddled by bullets,
I suggest we suit up.

1077
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:25,623
Where is Hank?

1078
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,918
I'm here.

1079
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,180
Hank?

1080
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:48,438
It didn't attack the cells.

1081
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:51,983
It enhanced them.

1082
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,359
It didn't work.

1083
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:56,654
Yes, it did, Hank. Don't you see?

1084
01:32:56,946 --> 01:33:00,158
This is who you were meant to be.

1085
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:01,826
This is you.

1086
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,330
No more hiding.

1087
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:08,666
- You never looked better, man.
- Hank!

1088
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,754
Don't mock me!

1089
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,397
Hank, put him down immediately, please.

1090
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:15,882
Hank! Hank!

1091
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:20,303
I wasn't.

1092
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,440
Even I got to admit you look pretty badass.

1093
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,432
I think I got a new name for you.

1094
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,392
Beast.

1095
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:30,480
You're sure you can fly this thing?

1096
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:33,358
Of course I can. I designed it.

1097
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,121
Status of the cargo ship.

1098
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:50,750
Bearing 1-8-0 at 12 knots.

1099
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:54,838
Three minutes to the embargo line, sir.

1100
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:58,758
God help them if they cross it.

1101
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:01,719
God help us all.

1102
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:05,598
- Sound general quarters.
- General quarters, general quarters!

1103
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,518
- All hands, man battle stations!
- Aye, sir.

1104
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:10,186
Set condition Zebra!

1105
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:12,897
<i>General quarters, battle stations.</i>

1106
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:29,038
Captain, we already have our orders.
Why so eager for new ones?

1107
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:33,001
I lived through one war, comrade.

1108
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,546
I'd prefer not to start another.

1109
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:41,134
Battle stations! NOW!

1110
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:48,683
Gun Boss, target cargo ship bearing 1-8-0.

1111
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:53,605
Fleet reports all weapons ready.

1112
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:55,899
From the Kremlin, sir.

1113
01:34:56,441 --> 01:35:00,403
New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo
vessel Aral Sea is hereby ordered to...

1114
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:03,072
reverse course
and return to port in Odessa.

1115
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:04,824
Aral Sea, come in.

1116
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:07,201
Aral Sea, come in.

1117
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,829
They are not responding.

1118
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:11,039
She's not turning around.

1119
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,917
Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.

1120
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:15,585
Do not cross the line.

1121
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,671
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.

1122
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:21,716
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.

1123
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:36,814
It looks pretty messy out there.

1124
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,535
Aral Sea you are ordered to turn around.

1125
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,206
The crew of the <i>Aral Sea </i>are all dead.
Shaw's been there.

1126
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,749
He's still here, somewhere.

1127
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:56,751
He set the ship on course
for the embargo line.

1128
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:59,712
If that ship crosses the line,
our boys are going to blow it up.

1129
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,422
And the war begins.

1130
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:03,341
Unless they're not our boys.

1131
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,930
<i>USS Independence,
</i>this is <i>Alexander Nevsky.</i>

1132
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,765
We have lost control of our cargo ship.

1133
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:12,558
<i>She has been instructed to stop.</i>

1134
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,478
Do not fire! Repeat, do not fire!

1135
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:18,940
They have signaled the cargo ship
to turn around, sir.

1136
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,401
It's a ruse. Pay no attention!

1137
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,404
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by to fire, sir.

1138
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:26,656
On my count. Five,

1139
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:28,533
four...

1140
01:36:50,847 --> 01:36:52,265
Hold on!

1141
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:02,775
<i>Nyet.</i>

1142
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:09,073
- What was that?
- The Russians.

1143
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:10,575
They have fired on their own ship.

1144
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:12,869
A little warning next time, Professor.

1145
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:16,122
- Sorry about that. You all right?
- Yeah.

1146
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,332
Son of a...

1147
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,918
Give me CINCLANT on the horn.
I want a new set of orders.

1148
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:27,050
Congratulations, comrade.

1149
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:31,179
You just averted nuclear war!

1150
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:33,139
What?

1151
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,891
Take him to the brig.

1152
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:38,644
What? What just happened?

1153
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:40,688
They say the comrade lost his mind.

1154
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:43,566
The Americans are applauding.

1155
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:48,112
They're here. That telepath is powerful.

1156
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:52,950
We're moving to a back-up plan.

1157
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:56,204
That was inspired, Charles.

1158
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:58,289
Thank you very much,
but I still can't locate Shaw.

1159
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:00,416
He's down there. We need to find him now.

1160
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,542
Hank?

1161
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,920
Is there anything unusual
on the radar or scanners?

1162
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:05,630
No. Nothing.

1163
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,967
Well, then he must be underwater.
And obviously, we don't have sonar.

1164
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:15,139
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, we do.

1165
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:20,978
They are ready for war.

1166
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,940
We just need to
strike another match to light the fuse.

1167
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:27,068
And we still have
the most powerful weapon of all.

1168
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:28,861
Me.

1169
01:38:29,195 --> 01:38:34,117
Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output
and make sure I'm not disturbed.

1170
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:39,497
Hank, level the bloody plane!

1171
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,963
Whoa! You back right off.

1172
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:49,966
Beast, open the bomb bay doors!

1173
01:38:58,307 --> 01:39:01,269
Remember! This is a muscle.

1174
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:02,937
You control it!

1175
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,356
You'll be in here the entire time!

1176
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,108
We'll see you soon!

1177
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:10,695
On my mark! Three! Two!

1178
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,822
One! Go!

1179
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:31,716
Alert the fleet,
they may want to take their cans off.

1180
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:47,565
Banshee has got a location on Shaw.

1181
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:52,236
- Are you ready for this?
- Let's find out.

1182
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:58,803
<i>Remember, the point between rage</i>

1183
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,264
<i>and serenity.</i>

1184
01:42:24,513 --> 01:42:25,681
Erik, take my hand!

1185
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:30,227
Hold on, guys. It's gonna get bumpy.

1186
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,036
Erik, take my hand!

1187
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:39,964
Moira? Moira, are you all right?

1188
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:41,841
Yeah, I'm okay.

1189
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:47,721
I read the teleporter's mind.

1190
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:49,723
Shaw is drawing all the power
out of his sub.

1191
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:51,892
<i>He's turning himself into
some kind of nuclear bomb.</i>

1192
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:54,257
We got no time.
The Geiger count is going out of control.

1193
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:55,438
Moira, this is what we're gonna do.

1194
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:58,201
Get on the radio and tell them to
clear both fleets out immediately.

1195
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,609
- I'm going in.
- Beast, Havok, back him up.

1196
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:02,695
Erik, I can guide you through
once you're in,

1197
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:05,239
but I need you to shut down
whatever it is that's blocking me,

1198
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,324
then we just hope to God
it's not too late for me to stop him.

1199
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:09,410
- Got it.
- Good luck!

1200
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:11,245
- Raven, stop!
- I'm going to help them.

1201
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:13,497
We don't have time for this.
If anything comes in that entrance,

1202
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:16,417
- you're taking care of it, yes?
- Fine.

1203
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,143
Beast!

1204
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,356
If we go, you go!

1205
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:45,112
We believe Shaw is trying to detonate
some kind of bomb.

1206
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:52,828
Erik, make for the middle of the vessel.

1207
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:54,552
That's the point my mind can't penetrate.

1208
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,832
We have to assume
that that's where Shaw is.

1209
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:07,551
Gangway! Gangway! Gangway!

1210
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,394
That's the nuclear reactor. Disable it.

1211
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:31,825
Stop! Don't move!

1212
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:40,876
Get down!

1213
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:05,859
<i>Erik, you're there.
You've reached the void.</i>

1214
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,571
He's not here, Charles. Shaw's not here!
He's left the sub!

1215
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:10,656
What? He's got to be there. He has to be!

1216
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,408
There's nowhere else he can be.
Keep looking.

1217
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:16,120
And I'm telling you he's not.
There's no one here, God damn it!

1218
01:46:19,164 --> 01:46:20,874
Erik.

1219
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:22,793
What a pleasant surprise.

1220
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:24,420
Erik? Erik.

1221
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:28,841
So good to see you again.

1222
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:48,777
May I ask you something?

1223
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:50,571
Why are you on their side?

1224
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:51,739
- He's gone.
- What?

1225
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:54,742
He's gone into the void!
I can't communicate with him there.

1226
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:57,411
Why fight for a doomed race
who will hunt us down

1227
01:46:57,494 --> 01:47:00,414
as soon as they realize
their reign is coming to an end?

1228
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:31,362
Yeah! Yes!

1229
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:46,293
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.

1230
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:50,381
I truly am.

1231
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,892
He's back!
Erik, whatever you're doing, keep doing it.

1232
01:48:01,975 --> 01:48:03,977
<i>It's starting to work.</i>

1233
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:06,980
But everything I did, I did for you.

1234
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:09,108
To unlock your power,

1235
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:11,652
to make you embrace it.

1236
01:48:14,947 --> 01:48:16,115
<i>It's working!</i>

1237
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:18,575
I'm starting to see him,
but I can't yet touch his mind.

1238
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:35,759
You've come a long way
from bending gates.

1239
01:48:35,843 --> 01:48:37,553
I'm so proud of you.

1240
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:47,938
And you're just starting
to scratch the surface.

1241
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:51,358
Think how much further we could go

1242
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:53,444
together.

1243
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:05,122
Look out!

1244
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:14,339
Stop! Azazel.

1245
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:34,026
I don't want to hurt you, Erik. I
never did. I want to help you.

1246
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:36,361
This is our time.

1247
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:38,238
Our age.

1248
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:43,076
We are the future of the human race.

1249
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,704
You and me, son.

1250
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:48,290
This world could be ours.

1251
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:53,796
Everything you did made me stronger.

1252
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:57,382
It made me the weapon I am today.

1253
01:49:58,884 --> 01:50:00,886
It's the truth.

1254
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:04,181
I've known it all along.

1255
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:11,855
You are my creator.

1256
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:14,066
Now, Charles!

1257
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:17,486
- Are you okay?
- Moira, be quiet.

1258
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:19,363
I can only control this man for so long.

1259
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:34,837
- Sorry, Charles.
<i>- Erik, please.</i>

1260
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:37,464
<i>- Be the better man.
</i>-It's not that I don't trust you.

1261
01:50:37,548 --> 01:50:39,341
<i>Erik, there will be no turning back!</i>

1262
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:42,219
No!

1263
01:50:42,928 --> 01:50:44,805
- Charles!
- Don't do this, Erik!

1264
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:53,647
If you're in there,

1265
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:56,775
I'd like you to know
that I agree with every word you said.

1266
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:01,446
We are the future.

1267
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:04,408
But,

1268
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:07,744
unfortunately,

1269
01:51:08,579 --> 01:51:10,998
you killed my mother.

1270
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:20,549
This is what we're going to do.

1271
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:23,010
No. Please, Erik, no.

1272
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:26,930
I'm going to count to three
and I'm going to move the coin.

1273
01:51:28,974 --> 01:51:30,642
One.

1274
01:51:31,894 --> 01:51:33,645
Please, Erik.

1275
01:51:41,737 --> 01:51:43,280
Two.

1276
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:51,538
Three.

1277
01:52:19,942 --> 01:52:25,864
The Russians share our concerns
and will join a strike on all the mutants.

1278
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:27,991
We can end this threat for good.

1279
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:29,952
We'll never have
another opportunity like this.

1280
01:52:30,035 --> 01:52:31,995
We have an agent on that beach.

1281
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:33,956
One agent.

1282
01:52:34,039 --> 01:52:35,415
She's a good agent.

1283
01:52:35,499 --> 01:52:37,668
She's collateral damage.

1284
01:52:43,173 --> 01:52:46,551
Today, our fighting stops!

1285
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:12,202
Take off your blinders,
brothers and sisters.

1286
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:14,705
The real enemy is out there.

1287
01:53:16,665 --> 01:53:18,709
I feel their guns moving in the water,

1288
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:21,420
their metal targeting us.

1289
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:24,047
Americans, Soviets,

1290
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:25,757
humans.

1291
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:28,969
United in their fear of the unknown.

1292
01:53:30,137 --> 01:53:33,890
The Neanderthal is running scared,
my fellow mutants!

1293
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:37,227
Go ahead, Charles.

1294
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:40,981
Tell me I'm wrong.

1295
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:04,212
Fleet Commander, this is X-Ray Bravo 7-0.

1296
01:54:04,296 --> 01:54:06,757
Respond. Over.

1297
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,134
The beach is secure. Call off the attack.

1298
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:11,845
The beach is targeted
and ready to be fired upon, sir.

1299
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:14,264
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.

1300
01:54:14,431 --> 01:54:16,224
New orders. Fire on the beach.

1301
01:54:18,393 --> 01:54:20,270
Hello?

1302
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,440
Hello!

1303
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,448
Fire!

1304
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,033
Fire!

1305
01:55:21,623 --> 01:55:24,042
Erik, you said yourself,
we're the better men.

1306
01:55:24,751 --> 01:55:26,336
This is the time to prove it.

1307
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:32,175
There are thousands of men
on those ships.

1308
01:55:32,259 --> 01:55:34,469
Good, honest, innocent men!

1309
01:55:34,553 --> 01:55:36,346
They're just following orders.

1310
01:55:38,306 --> 01:55:40,517
I've been at the mercy
of men just following orders.

1311
01:55:45,564 --> 01:55:47,107
Never again.

1312
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:52,821
Erik, release them!

1313
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:01,413
No!

1314
01:56:07,502 --> 01:56:09,921
I don't want to hurt you. Don't make me!

1315
01:56:10,755 --> 01:56:11,882
Stand back!

1316
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:15,886
Charles, that's enough!

1317
01:56:20,932 --> 01:56:22,058
Erik, stop!

1318
01:56:32,485 --> 01:56:34,696
Gentlemen, it's been an honor
serving with you.

1319
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:37,407
Comrades, thank you for your service.

1320
01:57:24,913 --> 01:57:26,206
I'm so sorry.

1321
01:57:26,289 --> 01:57:28,291
I said back off!

1322
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,128
You. You did this.

1323
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:38,635
Erik. Please.

1324
01:57:40,804 --> 01:57:43,807
She didn't do this, Erik.

1325
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:45,934
You did.

1326
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,069
Us turning on each other,
it's what they want.

1327
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:59,406
I tried to warn you, Charles.

1328
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,660
I want you by my side.

1329
01:58:03,743 --> 01:58:05,704
We're brothers, you and I.

1330
01:58:05,996 --> 01:58:09,207
All of us together, protecting each other.

1331
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:13,503
We want the same thing.

1332
01:58:14,045 --> 01:58:16,006
My friend.

1333
01:58:16,464 --> 01:58:20,260
I'm sorry, but we do not.

1334
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:39,821
Charles! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1335
01:58:39,904 --> 01:58:42,449
It's all right. It's all right.

1336
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:48,288
This society won't accept us.

1337
01:58:49,372 --> 01:58:50,874
We form our own.

1338
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:54,127
The humans have played their hand.

1339
01:58:55,837 --> 01:58:58,381
Now we get ready to play ours.

1340
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:01,885
Who's with me?

1341
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:14,939
No more hiding.

1342
01:59:42,926 --> 01:59:44,219
You should go with him.

1343
01:59:44,886 --> 01:59:46,262
It's what you want.

1344
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:49,182
You promised me
you would never read my mind.

1345
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:51,017
I know.

1346
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:53,353
I promised you a great many things,
I'm afraid.

1347
01:59:54,437 --> 01:59:55,563
I'm sorry.

1348
02:00:00,902 --> 02:00:02,987
Take care of him.

1349
02:00:17,794 --> 02:00:20,922
And, Beast, never forget.

1350
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:24,926
Mutant and proud.

1351
02:00:33,309 --> 02:00:35,103
Help me out, come on.

1352
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:37,439
I'm gonna get you to a hospital.

1353
02:00:37,814 --> 02:00:39,232
Wait, Charles.

1354
02:00:39,315 --> 02:00:40,942
Charles, don't move, okay?

1355
02:00:41,025 --> 02:00:42,861
I won't.

1356
02:00:42,944 --> 02:00:44,821
Actually...

1357
02:00:48,116 --> 02:00:50,160
I can't feel my legs.

1358
02:00:51,161 --> 02:00:53,496
- What?
- I can't feel my legs.

1359
02:00:55,081 --> 02:00:57,125
I can't feel my legs.

1360
02:01:08,761 --> 02:01:10,513
<i>In this week of Thanksgiving</i>

1361
02:01:10,597 --> 02:01:12,599
<i>there is much for which we can be grateful</i>

1362
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:16,102
<i>as we look back to where we stood
only four weeks ago.</i>

1363
02:01:16,186 --> 02:01:19,606
<i>The unity of this hemisphere,
the support of our allies</i>

1364
02:01:19,689 --> 02:01:22,525
<i>and the calm determination
of the American people.</i>

1365
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:26,446
<i>These qualities may be tested
many more times in this decade.</i>

1366
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:32,327
So, how many students
do you think you'll have here

1367
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:34,704
once you get the academy up and running?

1368
02:01:34,787 --> 02:01:36,956
As many as I can manage.

1369
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,875
Possibly more.

1370
02:01:41,503 --> 02:01:42,545
You know,

1371
02:01:43,505 --> 02:01:45,298
one day the government is going to realize

1372
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:47,800
how lucky they were to have
Professor X on their side.

1373
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:52,055
I suppose I am
a real professor now, aren't I?

1374
02:01:52,138 --> 02:01:53,738
Next thing you know, I'll be going bald.

1375
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:57,894
We're still on the
government's side, Moira.

1376
02:01:58,269 --> 02:02:00,522
We're still G-men. Just without the "G".

1377
02:02:01,272 --> 02:02:04,734
No. You're your own team now.

1378
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:06,361
It's better.

1379
02:02:07,111 --> 02:02:09,364
You're X-Men.

1380
02:02:11,074 --> 02:02:13,076
Yes, I like the sound of that.

1381
02:02:13,993 --> 02:02:15,286
Moira?

1382
02:02:15,787 --> 02:02:19,666
For us, anonymity will be
the first line of defense.

1383
02:02:20,458 --> 02:02:21,918
I know.

1384
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:27,549
They can threaten me
all they want, Charles.

1385
02:02:27,632 --> 02:02:30,510
I'll never tell them where you are.

1386
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:32,428
Ever.

1387
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:34,472
I know you won't.

1388
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:37,267
I know.

1389
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:47,569
I remember the attack on HQ,

1390
02:02:47,652 --> 02:02:49,988
leaving to go somewhere else.

1391
02:02:50,071 --> 02:02:54,075
And then this morning, I woke up at home.

1392
02:02:54,158 --> 02:02:56,327
That's it.

1393
02:02:56,411 --> 02:02:59,914
All that time, wiped clean from your mind.
Just gone.

1394
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:02,375
He can do that?
You don't remember anything?

1395
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:05,420
Sometimes I get fragments.

1396
02:03:05,587 --> 02:03:07,380
Like

1397
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:09,507
trees,

1398
02:03:09,591 --> 02:03:11,009
sunlight.

1399
02:03:12,885 --> 02:03:16,180
- A kiss.
- Oh, Jesus.

1400
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:19,475
Gentlemen, this is why
the CIA is no place for a woman.

1401
02:03:24,355 --> 02:03:25,481
What the hell was that?

1402
02:03:42,457 --> 02:03:45,168
I know we've had our differences.

1403
02:03:47,503 --> 02:03:49,672
Where's your telepath friend?

1404
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:52,425
Gone.

1405
02:03:52,508 --> 02:03:55,428
Left a bit of a gap in my life,
if I'm to be honest.

1406
02:03:55,511 --> 02:03:58,348
I was rather hoping you would fill it.

1407
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:03,853
Join us.

1408
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:12,695
Erik, I believe.

1409
02:04:16,616 --> 02:04:18,284
I prefer

1410
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:21,746
Magneto.
