1
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,585
<i>Mutants. Since the discovery
of their existence,</i>

2
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:49,882
<i>they have been regarded
with fear, suspicion, often hatred.</i>

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>Across the planet debate rages.</i>

4
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,722
<i>Are mutants the next link
in the evolutionary chain?</i>

5
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:01,394
<i>Or simply a new species of humanity,
fighting for their share of the world?</i>

6
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,480
<i>Either way, it is an historical fact</i>

7
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:10,611
<i>sharing the world has never been
humanity's defining attribute.</i>

8
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:55,448
"We are not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies."

9
00:01:55,616 --> 00:02:00,870
"Though passion may have strained, it
must not break the bonds of our affection."

10
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:05,958
Lincoln said that in his first inaugural
address as our nation's 16th president.

11
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,544
It's one of my favourites.

12
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:14,091
So, if you'll please have your tickets
ready, we can begin the tour.

13
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,892
Jackie, could you clear my schedule this
evening? I'm having dinner with my son.

14
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,310
Yes, Mr President.

15
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,007
Excuse me, sir. Are you lost?

16
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,229
Perimeter breach at visitors' checkpoint.

17
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,527
Multiple subjects.

18
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,406
Mr President, security breach. Jackie,
leave. Let's get him out to the car.

19
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,201
Exits not clear. We don't
know how many there are.

20
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,245
Both sides secure.

21
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,132
- There's something in the corridor.
- To the shelter.

22
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,383
Not clear.

23
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:48,853
- It's outside the Oval Office.
- Lock this place down.

24
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,286
Don't shoot!

25
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,190
My God.

26
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:17,269
Neanderthals. We once believed that
they were wiped out by years of conflict

27
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:21,607
with the much more advanced branch
of humanity called Cro-Magnon man,

28
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:27,863
but recent research into our DNA suggests
that these two species may have interbred,

29
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,283
evolving into modern humans.
In other words, into what?

30
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,911
- Us.
- Us. That's right.

31
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,872
Artie.

32
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,541
Not here.

33
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,883
Come on. Pay attention.

34
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,984
<i>...makes me insane when she does this...</i>

35
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,238
<i>What are you looking at? Sick...</i>

36
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,701
<i>To the shelter.</i>

37
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,078
<i>They're gonna kill him.</i>

38
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,921
Jean? You okay?

39
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,924
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

40
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,969
It's just a headache.

41
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,432
It's not just a headache, is it?

42
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,394
Listen, I wasn't sure how to say this, but
ever since Liberty Island you've been...

43
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,272
- Scott.
- You've been different.

44
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,194
My telepathy's been off lately.
I can't seem to focus. I hear everything.

45
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,029
Jean, it's not just your telepathy.

46
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,741
A month ago you had to concentrate just to
levitate a book or a chair across the room.

47
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:58,412
Now when you have a nightmare
the entire bedroom shakes.

48
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,790
My dreams are getting worse.

49
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:03,679
Scott.

50
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,632
I keep feeling
something terrible's about to happen.

51
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,306
I would never let anything happen to you.

52
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,559
Hey, have you guys seen Bobby and Rogue?

53
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,480
Something's happening in the food court.

54
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,107
- My brother asked you a simple question.
- Why are you being such a dick?

55
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,193
Yeah, why are you being such a dick?

56
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,320
Because I can.

57
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,241
Can I have a light?

58
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,206
- Sorry. Can't help you out, pal.
- John, knock it off.

59
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,125
- Why don't you stop showing off?
- For her?

60
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,337
- I can't help it if your girlfriend's getting excited.
- I don't think she's getting excited.

61
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,387
Don't get stuck up. We're trying
to have a good time here, all right?

62
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:53,534
I think you're the only one
having a good time.

63
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,721
That's real cute, man.

64
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,640
What are you gonna do?

65
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,019
Suddenly you're not so tough.

66
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,524
Bobby, what did you do?

67
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,401
I didn't do this.

68
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,903
No. I did.

69
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,583
And the next time
you feel like showing off, don't.

70
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,548
<i>- Breaking news.
- We're live from Washington,</i>

71
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,010
<i>where there's been an attack
in the Oval Office of the White House.</i>

72
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:23,515
<i>Details are still coming in, but we have been informed
that the president and vice president were not harmed.</i>

73
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,685
<i>Sources say the attack involved
one or more mutants...</i>

74
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:31,231
- I think it's time to leave, Professor.
- I think you're right.

75
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,829
- In my opinion, Magneto's behind this.
- No, I don't think so, Scott.

76
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,998
While Eric could organise
something like this from prison,

77
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,337
for him it would be irrational and only
hurt his goal of mutant prosperity.

78
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:57,132
- You mean superiority.
- You're right, if Eric had his way.

79
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,714
And of course you know how the
government would respond.

80
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,870
There will reintroduce
the Registration Act.

81
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,222
Or worse.

82
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:09,144
The president could declare a state of emergency,
place every mutant in the country under arrest.

83
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,054
Do you think the assassin
was working alone?

84
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,633
Well, we'll only know that if we
find him before the authorities do.

85
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:21,323
I've been trying to track him using Cerebro,
but his movements are inexplicably erratic.

86
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,995
When I have more exact coordinates, Storm, Jean,
I'll need you to take the jet and try and pick him up.

87
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,501
It was close, wasn't it?

88
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,295
Closer than anyone's admitted.

89
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:41,468
- What do you need, William?
- Just your authorisation for a special operation.

90
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,346
No, thank you, Mr President.

91
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,266
And somehow I thought you were here
to talk about school reform.

92
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,643
Funny you should say that, Mr President.

93
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,440
- Senator.
- Mr President. Thank you for having me.

94
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,819
- Senator Kelly, this is Colonel William Stryker.
- How do you do?

95
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:03,365
His department has been dealing with the
mutant phenomenon since before my time.

96
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,618
As I recall, you were a staunch supporter
of the Registration Act, Senator,

97
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,164
but it seems your ideas on
the mutant problem have changed recently.

98
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,040
For the best, I hope.

99
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,043
So what are you proposing, Mr Stryker?

100
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,726
May I, Mr President?

101
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,438
We've managed to gather evidence
of a mutant training facility

102
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:38,066
in the Salem region of upstate New York.

103
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,319
Where did you get this information?

104
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,656
Interrogation of one of the mutant
terrorists from the Liberty Island incident.

105
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,075
Eric? Eric Lehnsherr?

106
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,162
- You have access to him?
- Magneto, yes.

107
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,542
We developed the technology
that built his plastic prison.

108
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,256
- This facility is a school.
- Sure it is.

109
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,221
- What the hell is that?
- A jet.

110
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,432
- What kind of jet?
- We don't know.

111
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:15,103
But it comes up out of
the basketball court.

112
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,530
If we'd been allowed to do our jobs,
Mr President, before this incident...

113
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,907
All right, listen.

114
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,372
William, you enter, you detain,
you question,

115
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,962
but the last thing we need to see is the body
of a mutant kid on the six o'clock news.

116
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,680
- Mr Stryker?
- Senator Kelly.

117
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,393
This is Yuriko, my personal assistant.

118
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,937
- Quite a handshake.
- What can I do for you?

119
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,440
Eric Lehnsherr's prison.
I'd like to arrange a visit, if possible.

120
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,651
It isn't a petting zoo, Senator.

121
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,656
In this conflict he is the enemy, you're just a
spectator, so why not sit this one out, all right?

122
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:13,704
Conflict? Mr Stryker, do you really
want to turn this into some kind of war?

123
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,335
I was piloting black ops missions
in the jungles in North Vietnam

124
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,839
while you were sucking on your
mama's tit at Woodstock, Kelly.

125
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,926
Don't lecture me about war.
This already is a war.

126
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,898
- You're dead. You're so dead.
- You're dead.

127
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,448
I don't wanna hurt you.

128
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,993
I'm not afraid.

129
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,597
Logan.

130
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,225
You miss me, kid?

131
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,727
Not really.

132
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,313
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay. How are you?

133
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,482
- Who's this?
- This is Bobby. He's my...

134
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm her boyfriend.

135
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,861
Call me Iceman.

136
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,908
Right.

137
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,828
Boyfriend? So how do you guys...?

138
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,081
Well, we're still working on that.

139
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,918
Look who's come back. Just in time.

140
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,920
For what?

141
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,090
- We need a baby-sitter.
- Baby-sitter?

142
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,800
Nice to see you again, Logan.

143
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,761
Hi, Logan.

144
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,222
Hi, Jean.

145
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,141
I should go and get the jet ready.

146
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,769
Well, it was good to meet you.

147
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:04,398
- Come on, let's go.
- Bye, Logan. I'll see you later.

148
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,273
Okay.

149
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,699
Storm and I are heading to Boston.
We won't be gone long.

150
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,536
The professor wants us to track down
a mutant who attacked the president.

151
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,413
So it was a mutant.

152
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:25,544
You'll be here when we get back,
unless you plan on running off again.

153
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:30,215
I could probably think of
a few reasons to stick around.

154
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,551
Find what you were looking for, Logan?

155
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,303
More or less.

156
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,472
I'll see you boys later.

157
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,435
- Be safe, okay?
- You too. Bye.

158
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,562
See ya.

159
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,775
Aren't you gonna welcome me home?

160
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,446
Your bike needs gas.

161
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,072
Then fill her up.

162
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,429
Mr Laurio, how long can we keep this up?

163
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,934
- How long is your sentence?
- Forever.

164
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:28,190
Not necessarily forever, Mr Lehnsherr.
Just until I've got all that I need.

165
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,359
Mr Stryker, how kind of you to visit.

166
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,042
Have you come back to make sure
the taxpayers' dollars

167
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:37,683
are keeping me comfortable?

168
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,558
Done. You can go.

169
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,271
Now...

170
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,859
Mr Lehnsherr.

171
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,657
I'd like to have one final talk

172
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:24,387
about the house that Xavier built
and the machine called Cerebro.

173
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,383
Logan, my tolerance for your smoking
in the mansion notwithstanding,

174
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,845
continue smoking that in here
and you'll spend the rest of your days

175
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,681
under the belief you are
a six-year-old girl.

176
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,935
- Can you do that?
- I'd have Jean braid your hair.

177
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,104
Welcome back.

178
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,586
- You want me to leave?
- No. Just don't move.

179
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:24,014
These lights represent
every living person on the planet.

180
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,894
The white lights are humans.

181
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,773
And these are the mutants.

182
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,112
Through Cerebro I'm connected to them,

183
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,156
and they to me.

184
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,305
You see, Logan?

185
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:48,828
We're not as alone as you think.

186
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,502
I found the base at Alkali Lake.

187
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,421
There was nothing there.

188
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:01,426
The broken line represents the path
of the mutant who attacked the president.

189
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:05,180
I've been finding it difficult
to get a lock on it.

190
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,600
Well, can't you just concentrate harder?

191
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,186
If I wanted to kill him, yes.

192
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,815
There.

193
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,568
Looks like he's finally stopped running.

194
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,045
I need you to read my mind again.

195
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,786
Logan.

196
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:50,475
- I'm afraid the results will be the same as before.
- We had a deal.

197
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:56,231
The mind is not a box that can be simply unlocked
and opened. It's a beehive with a million...

198
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:58,156
Spare me the lectures.

199
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,778
I've no doubt your amnesia,
your adamantium skeleton,

200
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:05,740
the claws are all somehow connected, but...

201
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:11,413
Logan, sometimes the mind
needs to discover things for itself.

202
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,582
I promise you we'll talk
again when I return.

203
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,379
Oh, if you would be kind enough
to watch over the children tonight.

204
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,966
Scott and I are going
to visit an old friend.

205
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,858
<i>I'm sending the coordinates of where the
mutant seems to have settled for now.</i>

206
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,902
<i>As soon as you find him,
bring him back to the mansion.</i>

207
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,490
- Let's hope he cooperates.
<i>- Yes, for his sake. Good luck.</i>

208
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,060
Stryker, William.

209
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,081
What are you doing in here?

210
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,511
I'm throwing away the trash.

211
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,841
Garbage.

212
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,350
These are the coordinates.

213
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:54,088
Get out!

214
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,799
The messenger of the devil.

215
00:26:57,471 --> 00:27:00,049
In the lair of the beast.

216
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:06,624
He's a teleporter. Must be why
the professor had trouble locking onto him.

217
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,752
We're not here to hurt you.

218
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,673
We just wanna talk.

219
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,507
Get out!

220
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:19,195
You are the messengers of the devil.

221
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,681
- Are you bored yet?
- Oh, yeah.

222
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,560
Sure you don't wanna come down?

223
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,376
- You have him?
- He's not going anywhere.

224
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,837
Are you?

225
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,715
Please don't kill me.
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

226
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,093
Why would people
have gotten that impression?

227
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,431
- What's your name?
- Wagner. Kurt Wagner.

228
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:12,065
There was so much shooting, such fear.

229
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,984
And then there was only pain.

230
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,532
I could see it all happening,
but I couldn't stop myself.

231
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,993
It was like a bad dream.

232
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,663
Perhaps He is testing me.

233
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,879
And before you were in the White House,
what do you remember?

234
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,714
Nothing.

235
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,283
I was here.

236
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:42,001
Jean.

237
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,892
- I'd rather get him back to the professor.
- The professor?

238
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,650
Did you do these yourself?

239
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,531
Yes.

240
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,868
And what about this?

241
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,601
<i>- I need you to read my mind again.
- I'm afraid the results will be the same as before.</i>

242
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,147
<i>- You'll be indestructible.
- No memory.</i>

243
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:38,776
<i>Sometimes the mind needs
to discover things for itself.</i>

244
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,903
<i>Wolverine.</i>

245
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:46,868
<i>No memory. He'll have no memory.</i>

246
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,058
<i>A dozen tourists in the White House during the
attack are still being held for questioning.</i>

247
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:05,208
<i>Best tasting food. A machine
that's so darn easy...</i>

248
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,191
<i>President will address the nation...</i>

249
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:15,113
<i>...once a...</i>

250
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:18,035
<i>...for the White House assassin,
following hundreds of...</i>

251
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,860
Can't sleep?

252
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,154
How can you tell?

253
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,239
'Cause you're awake.

254
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,492
Right. How about you?

255
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:30,079
I don't sleep.

256
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:37,542
Hey.

257
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:42,548
- Doesn't anybody sleep around here?
- Apparently not.

258
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,886
- Got any beer?
- This is a school.

259
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:49,180
- So that's a no?
- Yeah, that's a no.

260
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:51,051
Is there anything other
than chocolate milk?

261
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:54,060
There should be some soda
in that small cupboard.

262
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,159
- Thanks.
- No problem.

263
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,003
I'll take him from here.

264
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,882
It's all right, Scott.

265
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,510
- Nice shades.
- Thanks.

266
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,585
Charles Xavier.
Have you come to rescue me?

267
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,337
Sorry, Eric, not today.

268
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,256
To what do I owe the pleasure?

269
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,178
The assassination attempt on the President.
What do you know about it?

270
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,264
Nothing.

271
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,766
Only what I read in the papers.

272
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,353
You really shouldn't have to ask, Charles.

273
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,439
What's happened to you?

274
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,818
I've had frequent visits
from William Stryker.

275
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,237
You remember him, don't you?

276
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,135
William Stryker.

277
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:35,953
His son, Jason, was once
a student of yours, wasn't he?

278
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,038
Yes. Years ago.

279
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,959
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to help him.

280
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,503
At least, not in the way
that his father wanted.

281
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:50,509
And now you think taking in Wolverine will
make up for your failure with Stryker's son?

282
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,059
- How long you been here?
- A couple of years.

283
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:02,563
And your parents just sent you off
to mutant school?

284
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:06,734
Actually, my parents think
this is a prep school.

285
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:12,698
I see. Well, I suppose lots of prep schools
have their own dorms, campuses...

286
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,825
Jets.

287
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,205
- So you and Rogue, huh?
- Yeah.

288
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:23,584
It's not what you think.
I'd like it to be, but it's just...

289
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:30,716
It's just that it's not easy when you
wanna be closer to someone, but you can't.

290
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:37,947
You know, I've seen how
you look at Dr Grey.

291
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,184
Excuse me?

292
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,519
Nothin'.

293
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,689
You haven't told him about
his past, have you?

294
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,607
I've put him on the path.

295
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,859
Logan's mind is still fragile.

296
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,278
Is it?

297
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:56,742
Or are you afraid of losing
one of your precious X-Men, old friend?

298
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,623
Eric, what have you done?

299
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,794
I'm sorry, Charles.

300
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,256
I couldn't help it.

301
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,467
What have you told Stryker?

302
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,596
Everything.

303
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,771
The war has begun.

304
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,153
Scott!

305
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,781
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

306
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,576
<i>But now and then
every mother needs to get away.</i>

307
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:16,842
<i>Without her, the babies are helpless...</i>

308
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:21,898
<i>Sensing danger, the mother rat races home.</i>

309
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:24,773
<i>The babies can't even see the killer,</i>

310
00:35:24,787 --> 00:35:28,342
<i>and someone uninvited is coming to dinner.</i>

311
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:32,609
<i>She arrives too late for one baby.</i>

312
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,969
<i>The stampede was deafening.</i>

313
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,346
Hi.

314
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,447
What is it?

315
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,942
You picked the wrong house, bub.

316
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,733
You all right?

317
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,120
Stay here.

318
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:06,462
- Move.
- Move.

319
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:09,103
- Go.
- Secure perimeter.

320
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,669
- This way.
- Let's go.

321
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:25,908
Move, move, move.

322
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,189
John! Hey, where's Rogue?

323
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:41,235
- I don't know.
- I gotta find her.

324
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,990
- Open it.
- Here, take her.

325
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:55,040
Go on, get in. Let's go, let's go. Come on.

326
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,005
Hey, take him. He's stunned.

327
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,923
- I can help you.
- Help them.

328
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,115
- Rogue!
- Bobby!

329
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,242
This way.

330
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,757
Come on. Everybody, follow me up here.

331
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,014
- Move, move.
- Go, go.

332
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,941
Come on.

333
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,707
Let's go.

334
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,087
Come on, this way.

335
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,551
This is it.

336
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,097
Logan.

337
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,975
- You wanna shoot me, shoot me.
- Don't shoot him.

338
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,895
Not yet.

339
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,940
Wolverine?

340
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:47,820
I must admit this is certainly
the last place I'd expect to find you.

341
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,781
How long has it been? 15 years?

342
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,992
You haven't changed one bit.

343
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,412
Me, on the other hand...

344
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,834
Nature.

345
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,389
Wait, wait, you guys. We've gotta
do something. They're gonna kill him.

346
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,220
- He can handle himself. Let's go.
- Bobby.

347
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,389
Please.

348
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:20,978
I didn't realise Xavier was taking in
animals, even animals as unique as you.

349
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,105
Who are you?

350
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,234
Don't you remember?

351
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,418
No! No!

352
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,381
Logan, come on. Let's go.

353
00:42:02,507 --> 00:42:03,648
Logan.

354
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,400
- Go. I'll be fine.
- But we won't.

355
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:18,952
Go. Keep going.

356
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,231
- Right, get in. Get in.
- I'm driving.

357
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,816
Maybe next time.

358
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,447
This is Cyclops's car.

359
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,157
Oh, yeah?

360
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,137
What the hell was that back there?

361
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,931
Stryker.

362
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,975
His name is Stryker.

363
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,687
- Who is he?
- I can't remember.

364
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,489
Here.

365
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,032
This is yours.

366
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,772
- I don't like uncomfortable silences.
- What are you doing?

367
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:55,499
<i>♪ I don't really wanna make... ♪</i>

368
00:43:59,644 --> 00:44:02,855
I don't think that's a CD player.

369
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,649
- Sit back.
- Where are we going?

370
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:16,320
Storm and Jean are in Boston.
We'll head that way.

371
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,822
- My parents live in Boston.
- Good.

372
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,506
Sergeant?

373
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,114
Most of the mutants escaped through a series
of tunnels that weren't in our schematics.

374
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,095
- We have several in custody.
- How many?

375
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:43,604
Six, sir.

376
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:12,292
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

377
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,607
Take what we need, gentlemen.

378
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:43,740
<i>I just think all this anti-mutant protest underscores
a genuine growing concern among most Americans.</i>

379
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,242
<i>I think mutant registration...</i>

380
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,316
<i>Why stop there? Maybe it would be easier
to round up mutants by the truckload.</i>

381
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,999
<i>- Or maybe you'd like an all-out war?
- Shut up, please.</i>

382
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:57,421
- Turn that shit off, Lou.
- A lot on your mind?

383
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,051
Mr Laurio?

384
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,848
I'm Grace.

385
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,943
You want another beer?

386
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,572
Of course you do.

387
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,833
- You're really aggressive.
- Yes, I am.

388
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:40,672
I've never hooked up with
a girl like you before.

389
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,382
I know.

390
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:48,805
- It's kind of dirty in here, don't you think?
- That's the idea.

391
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,348
Velcro?

392
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,725
Nice.

393
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:54,895
- Bottoms up.
- I certainly hope so.

394
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,079
Bottoms up.

395
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,145
- William...
- Please, Xavier, don't get up.

396
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:43,443
I call it the neural inhibitor.
It keeps you outta here.

397
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,198
- What have you done with Scott?
- Don't worry.

398
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:50,951
I'm just giving him a little re-education.

399
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,703
Of course, you know
all about that, don't you?

400
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,897
William, you wanted me to cure your son,
but mutation is not a disease.

401
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,544
You're lying.

402
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,714
You were more frightened of him
than I was.

403
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:10,011
You know, just one year after Jason
returned from your school, my wife...

404
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,265
You see, he resented us.

405
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:18,228
He blamed us for his condition,
so he would toy with our minds,

406
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:22,274
projecting visions and scenarios
into our brains.

407
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:25,735
My wife, in the end,

408
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:32,784
she took a power drill to her left temple
in an attempt to bore the images out.

409
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,454
My boy, the great illusionist.

410
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:48,925
For someone who hates mutants,
you certainly keep some strange company.

411
00:48:49,889 --> 00:48:54,472
They serve their purpose,
as long as they can be controlled.

412
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:03,106
You arranged the attack on the president.

413
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,361
You didn't even have to read my mind.

414
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,491
You know, I've been working with
mutants as long as you have, Xavier,

415
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:18,622
but the most frustrating thing I've learned is
nobody really knows how many even exist

416
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,832
or how to find them.

417
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:25,045
Except you.

418
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,715
Unfortunately, this little potion
won't work on you, will it?

419
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,009
You're much too powerful for that.

420
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:34,220
Instead, we'll go right to the source.

421
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:40,226
Allow me to introduce mutant 143.

422
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,191
The fluid secreted by his brain
acts as a mind-controlling agent.

423
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,653
But that's only where it begins.

424
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,030
Jason?

425
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:55,075
Oh my God, William. This is your son.

426
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,495
- What have you done to him?
- No, Charles.

427
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,872
My son is dead.

428
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,501
Just like the rest of you.

429
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,234
Mom? Dad?

430
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:31,361
Ronny? Is anybody home?

431
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,575
I'll try and find you some clothes.

432
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,119
Don't burn anything.

433
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:52,111
Hey.

434
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,718
I found some of my mom's old clothes.

435
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,929
I think they're from before I was born.

436
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,099
Groovy.

437
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,733
Hello?

438
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,240
Hello?

439
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,114
Jean. Where are you?

440
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:50,106
These are my grandmother's.

441
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,484
Thanks.

442
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,696
You won't hurt me.

443
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,957
Wow.

444
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,553
I'm sorry.

445
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:24,662
It's okay.

446
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,462
Hey Ronny, next time you...

447
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:58,550
Who the hell are you?

448
00:53:01,157 --> 00:53:05,849
- Honey, aren't you supposed to be at school?
- Bobby, who is this guy?

449
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,103
This is Professor Logan.

450
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,861
There's something I need to tell you.

451
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,800
You're clear.

452
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,861
Have a nice sleep, Lehnsherr?

453
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:08,265
- There's something different about you, Mr Lorian.
- Yeah. I was having a good day.

454
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:09,406
No.

455
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,874
It's not that.

456
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,210
- Sit down.
- No.

457
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,839
- Sit your ass down.
- What could it be?

458
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,844
What are you doing?

459
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,932
There it is.

460
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,394
Too much iron in your blood.

461
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:58,503
Mr Laurio, never trust a beautiful woman,
especially one who's interested in you.

462
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:47,997
So...

463
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:52,265
When did you first know you were a...

464
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,225
A mutant?

465
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,604
Would you cut that out?

466
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:02,608
You have to understand. We thought
Bobby was going to a school for the gifted.

467
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,570
- Bobby is gifted.
- We know that. We just didn't realise...

468
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:10,366
We still love you, Bobby. It's just
this mutant problem is a little...

469
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,452
What mutant problem?

470
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,205
...complicated.

471
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,959
- What exactly are you a professor of, Mr Logan?
- Art.

472
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,629
You should see what Bobby can do.

473
00:56:32,132 --> 00:56:33,445
Bobby?

474
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,812
I can do a lot more than that.

475
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:46,172
Honey?

476
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,116
This is all my fault.

477
00:56:52,205 --> 00:56:53,995
Actually, they discovered
that males are the ones

478
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:57,943
who carry the mutant gene and
pass it on, so it's his fault.

479
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:05,171
<i>911. Please state your emergency.</i>

480
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:09,926
I need the police. There are people
in our house. They won't let us leave.

481
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:14,806
<i>But it's believed a manhunt for several
fugitives from the facility is now under way.</i>

482
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,270
Nobody's responding. I can't get a signal.

483
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:25,408
Why don't you take a break?
I'll keep trying.

484
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:31,899
Holy, under God.

485
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:36,437
Please hear us now, and
in the hour of our death.

486
00:57:36,461 --> 00:57:39,859
How great are you, Mary, for your mercy?

487
00:57:39,891 --> 00:57:41,711
The Lord is with you.

488
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:47,617
You are blessed under women, and blessed
is the fruit of the life of Jesus.

489
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:50,844
Holy Mary, mother of God.

490
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:55,852
So...

491
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,224
What are they?

492
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:05,189
They're angelic symbols passed on
to mankind by the archangel Gabriel.

493
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:08,401
They're beautiful.

494
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,903
How many do you have?

495
00:58:10,969 --> 00:58:13,030
One for every sin.

496
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:16,284
So quite a few.

497
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,165
You and Miss Grey are schoolteachers?

498
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:26,878
Yes. At a school for people like us,
where we can be safe.

499
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,006
Safe from what?

500
00:58:30,056 --> 00:58:32,015
Everyone else.

501
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:38,264
You know, outside of the circus
most people were afraid of me.

502
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,934
But I didn't hate them. I pitied them.

503
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,855
Do you know why?

504
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:52,236
Because most people will never know anything
beyond what they see with their own two eyes.

505
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,824
Well, I gave up on pity a long time ago.

506
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:05,666
Someone so beautiful
should not be so angry.

507
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:12,673
Sometimes anger can help you survive.

508
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,677
So can faith.

509
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:20,681
- Storm, I found an active com device.
- Where?

510
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,985
Oh, God. It's for me.

511
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:36,377
Bobby.

512
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,703
Have you tried not being a mutant?

513
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,998
No one's left, Jean. Soldiers came.

514
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,291
What about the children?

515
00:59:47,318 --> 00:59:50,461
I saw them escape.
Not sure about the rest.

516
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,089
We haven't been able to reach
the professor or Scott either.

517
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:56,467
<i>- Where are you, Logan?</i>
- Boston, with Bobby Drake's family.

518
00:59:56,635 --> 01:00:01,764
- Okay. We're on our way.
- And, Storm, make it fast.

519
01:00:07,763 --> 01:00:08,583
We have to go now.

520
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,614
- Why?
- Now!

521
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,262
Logan, what's wrong?

522
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,948
Drop the knives
and put your hands in the air.

523
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,534
What's going on here?

524
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:24,912
- Ronny.
- I said drop the knives.

525
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,291
- Open the door.
- Break it.

526
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:32,128
Turn around. Up against the wall.

527
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:37,300
- This is just a misunderstanding.
- Put the knives down.

528
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,844
I can't.

529
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,430
Look.

530
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:50,438
All right, the rest of
you, on the ground now.

531
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,316
Look, kid, I said on the ground.

532
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:03,117
We don't wanna hurt you, kid.

533
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:13,002
You know all those dangerous mutants
you hear about on the news?

534
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:16,630
I'm the worst one.

535
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,989
Get down.

536
01:03:21,195 --> 01:03:22,515
Hello.

537
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,636
- Who the hell is this?
- Kurt Wagner.

538
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,806
But in the Munich Circus I was known as
"The Incredible Nightcrawler".

539
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:34,393
- Save it. Storm.
- We're outta here.

540
01:03:55,216 --> 01:03:57,676
Jason, stop it.

541
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:24,109
It's all right. You can come out.

542
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,070
- Have they gone?
- Yes.

543
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,494
- Where are all the other students?
- I don't know.

544
01:04:33,513 --> 01:04:36,139
Well then, we'll have
to find them, won't we?

545
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,296
We'll use Cerebro.

546
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,468
Come on.

547
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,437
How far are we?

548
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:04,692
We're actually coming up
on the mansion now.

549
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:08,112
I've got two signals approaching.

550
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:10,322
Coming in fast.

551
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:19,498
<i>Unidentified aircraft,
you are ordered to descend to 20,000ft.</i>

552
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:24,295
<i>Return with our escort to Hanscom Air Force
Base. You have ten seconds to comply.</i>

553
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,256
- Wow. Somebody's angry.
- I wonder why.

554
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:31,594
<i>We are coming up alongside you
to escort you to Hanscom Air Force Base.</i>

555
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,220
<i>Lower your altitude now.</i>

556
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:43,272
<i>Repeat: lower your altitude to 20,000ft.
This is your last warning.</i>

557
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,819
They're falling back.

558
01:05:51,163 --> 01:05:54,700
They're marking us.
They're gonna fire. Hang on.

559
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,338
I gotta shake them.

560
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,055
- Please don't do that again.
- I agree.

561
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,769
Don't we have any weapons in this heap?

562
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,584
<i>Warning. Warning. Warning.</i>

563
01:07:02,688 --> 01:07:06,172
<i>Warning. Warning. Warning.
Warning. Warning.</i>

564
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:12,609
Warning. Warning. Warning.
Warning. Warning. Warning.

565
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,226
Warning. Warning. Warning.
Warning. Warning.

566
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,630
- Everybody okay back there?
- No.

567
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,305
Oh my God. There's two of 'em.

568
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,743
There's one more.

569
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,954
Jean?

570
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:07,291
Oh, God.

571
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,595
- Rogue!
- No!

572
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,138
- Jean?
- It's not me.

573
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,489
When will these people learn how to fly?

574
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,175
Thank you.

575
01:09:40,212 --> 01:09:41,900
You're welcome.

576
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:52,521
- Can you hear what they're saying?
- I could take a closer look.

577
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:58,861
His name is Colonel William Stryker, and
he invaded your mansion for one purpose.

578
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,947
He wanted Cerebro.

579
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,575
Or enough of it to build one of his own.

580
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:09,329
That doesn't make any sense. Stryker
would need the professor to operate it.

581
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:12,958
Which I think is the only reason
my old friend's still alive.

582
01:10:13,017 --> 01:10:15,018
Oh my God.

583
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,213
What are you all so afraid of?

584
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:22,926
While Cerebro is working, Charles's mind is
connected to every living person on the planet.

585
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:25,984
If he were forced to concentrate
hard enough on a particular group,

586
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,724
let's say, mutants, for example,

587
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,894
he could kill us all.

588
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:36,273
Wait a minute. How would Stryker even know
where to find Cerebro in the first place?

589
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:42,237
Because I told him.

590
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,616
I helped Charles build it, remember?

591
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:50,120
Mr Stryker has powerful methods
of persuasion,

592
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,956
even against a mutant as strong as Charles.

593
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,878
- So who is this Stryker anyway?
- He's a military scientist.

594
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:01,965
He spent his whole life
trying to solve the mutant problem.

595
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:06,887
If you want a more intimate perspective,
why don't you ask Wolverine?

596
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:10,182
You don't remember, do you?

597
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:14,770
William Stryker, the only other man I know
who can manipulate adamantium.

598
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:19,399
The metal on your bones,
it carries his signature.

599
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:23,665
- But the professor...
- The professor trusted you were smart enough

600
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,406
to discover this on your own.

601
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:29,159
He gives you more credit than I do.

602
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:31,620
Why do you need us?

603
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:34,289
Mystique has discovered plans of a base

604
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,668
that Stryker's been operating
out of for decades.

605
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:40,160
We know that's where he's building
the second Cerebro,

606
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:44,132
but we don't know where the base is.

607
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,635
And I believe one of you might.

608
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,804
The professor already tried.

609
01:11:49,128 --> 01:11:52,421
Once again, you think it's all about you.

610
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,563
Hello.

611
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,821
I didn't mean to snoop.

612
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,323
Just try and relax.

613
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:26,341
I'm sorry.

614
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:33,052
- Stryker's at Alkali Lake.
- That's where the professor sent me.

615
01:12:33,106 --> 01:12:36,484
- There's nothing left.
- There's nothing left on the surface, Logan.

616
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,354
The base is underground.

617
01:12:53,787 --> 01:12:55,615
- Hey.
- Hey.

618
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,124
You okay?

619
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,544
- Yeah.
- You sure?

620
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,671
How we doin'?

621
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:09,801
Not good. It looks like four or five hours
before I can get it off the ground.

622
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:12,345
That's not what I meant.

623
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:17,642
- I'm just worried about Scott.
- I'm worried about you.

624
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,645
That was some display of power up there.

625
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:25,650
- Obviously it wasn't enough.
- Come on.

626
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,489
I love him.

627
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,868
Do you?

628
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:39,498
Girls flirt with the dangerous guy, Logan.
They don't take him home.

629
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,667
They marry the good guy.

630
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,629
I could be the good guy.

631
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:48,090
Logan, the good guy sticks around.

632
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:54,900
Jean.

633
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:57,349
Please. Please.

634
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,602
- Don't make me do this.
- Do what?

635
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,647
This.

636
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,367
Excuse me.

637
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:21,331
They say you can imitate anybody,
even their voice.

638
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:24,376
Even their voice.

639
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:28,547
Then why not stay in disguise
all the time, you know?

640
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,883
Look like everyone else?

641
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,719
'Cause we shouldn't have to.

642
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,584
Look...

643
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:34,863
- No one's ever left a scar quite like you.
- What do you want, an apology?

644
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,990
You know what I want.

645
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,161
But what do you want?

646
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,342
What do you really want?

647
01:15:57,428 --> 01:15:59,429
I want you to get out.

648
01:16:04,852 --> 01:16:06,811
Jesus.

649
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:15,070
- Why don't we get uniforms?
- Yeah, where's ours?

650
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:19,199
They're on order.
Should arrive in a few years.

651
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:30,168
We love what you've done with your hair.

652
01:16:31,413 --> 01:16:32,960
Hey, hey.

653
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,465
Come on, let's go.

654
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:45,684
So, they say you're the bad guy.

655
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:50,438
Is that what they say?

656
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:56,653
It's a dorky-looking helmet.
What's it for?

657
01:16:56,821 --> 01:17:02,742
This dorky-looking helmet is the only thing
that's gonna protect me from the real bad guys.

658
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,166
What's your name?

659
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,127
John.

660
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:15,630
What's your real name, John?

661
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:23,555
Pyro.

662
01:17:23,582 --> 01:17:25,765
Quite a talent you have there, Pyro.

663
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,893
I can only manipulate the fire.

664
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,687
I can't create it.

665
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:36,568
You are a god among insects.
Never let anyone tell you different.

666
01:17:56,547 --> 01:18:01,176
Sir, the machine has been completed
to all specifications.

667
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,969
Good.

668
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:10,518
If I may ask, sir,
why are we keeping the children here?

669
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,022
I'm a scientist, Sergeant Lyman.

670
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:18,360
When I build a machine,
I wanna make sure that it's working.

671
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:29,245
All right, this is a topographic map
of the dam. This is the spillway.

672
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,832
See these density changes in the terrain?
They're tire tracks.

673
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,126
That's the entrance.

674
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:38,380
And this shows the depth of the ice
that's covering the ground.

675
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:43,968
- Now this is recent water activity.
- If we go in there, Stryker could flood the spillway.

676
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,471
- Can you teleport inside?
- No.

677
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:52,143
I have to be able to see where I'm going,
otherwise I could wind up inside a wall.

678
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,437
I'll go.

679
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:57,524
- I've a hunch he'll want me alive.
- Wolverine.

680
01:18:57,602 --> 01:19:00,944
Whoever goes into the dam needs to be
able to operate the spillway mechanism.

681
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:03,405
What do you intend to do?

682
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,408
Scratch it with your claws?

683
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,412
- I'll take my chances.
- But I won't.

684
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,895
Sir, there's someone
coming down the spillway.

685
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:42,527
- I'm flooding it.
- Wait.

686
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,201
Stryker!

687
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:00,778
Stryker!

688
01:20:02,388 --> 01:20:03,724
Well...

689
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:06,050
Look who's come home.

690
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,941
Move, and you're dead.

691
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:57,060
The one thing I know better than anyone
is my own work. Seal the room. Shoot it.

692
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,479
Seal the room. Step away.

693
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:18,490
We have a metamorph loose.
Could be anybody.

694
01:21:18,646 --> 01:21:19,896
Anybody?

695
01:21:31,262 --> 01:21:34,389
- Can you override the spillway mechanism?
- Everything's controlled from inside that room.

696
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:36,933
- That's why the doors are so thick.
- Oh, really?

697
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:40,770
Get some charges. Blow the doors open.

698
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,357
Take out these cameras.

699
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,820
I'm in.

700
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:52,532
- She's good.
- You have no idea.

701
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:06,838
Fire in the hole.

702
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,721
Move, move, move.

703
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:35,283
Sergeant, she's opened the spillway doors.
More mutants have entered the base.

704
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:36,277
How many?

705
01:22:36,303 --> 01:22:38,227
We've lost coms, there's some
sort of electrical interference.

706
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:42,081
Sergeant Lyman, gather the rest of your men
and meet me outside Cerebro.

707
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:46,878
You, carry on. When I come back
I want this door open all the way.

708
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:02,060
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

709
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,979
Don't leave me alone. Please?

710
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,774
You can come inside.

711
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:03,871
Have you found it?

712
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,792
A large portion of energy from the dam
has been diverted to this chamber.

713
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,169
- Cerebro.
- There it is.

714
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:12,714
- Can you shut it down from here?
- No.

715
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:16,509
- Come. There's little time.
- Not without us.

716
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:22,223
Oh my God. The children.

717
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,892
- Kurt, will you come with me?
- Yes.

718
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,091
Where are they?

719
01:24:26,117 --> 01:24:28,577
They're being held in a
containment cell one level down.

720
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:29,875
Stryker.

721
01:24:30,858 --> 01:24:34,694
All right, we'll get the children
and meet you at Cerebro.

722
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:37,697
Okay, I'll try to find
Scott and the professor.

723
01:24:37,865 --> 01:24:41,951
- Will you be all right without us?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

724
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,496
Where's Logan?

725
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,420
He's gone.

726
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:56,716
You. Set up a perimeter.

727
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:38,549
Jason.

728
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,099
It's time.

729
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:55,483
Time to find our friends.

730
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,949
Is it time to find our friends?

731
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:06,160
- All of them.
- All of them.

732
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:08,913
- All of the mutants.
- All the mutants?

733
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,123
Everywhere.

734
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:14,669
- Everywhere.
- That's right.

735
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:17,797
- Every one of them?
- Oh yes.

736
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:19,590
Good.

737
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,636
It's time to bring it to an end.

738
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:27,974
Make me proud.

739
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:59,338
Just don't move.

740
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:04,051
Kill anyone who approaches.

741
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:06,295
Even if it's me.

742
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:33,915
Go! I'll take care of him.

743
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:37,710
This is one lovers' quarrel
we cannot get involved in, my dear.

744
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:51,182
Scott! Scott?

745
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:56,520
- Help us, anybody!
- Listen.

746
01:27:56,695 --> 01:27:58,250
- Help!
- Get us out of here.

747
01:27:58,329 --> 01:27:59,001
Help us!

748
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:00,132
- Jubilee?
- Storm.

749
01:28:00,187 --> 01:28:01,069
- Help.
- Help us out!

750
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,141
- Get us out of here!
- Okay, we're coming.

751
01:28:17,387 --> 01:28:18,629
Scott!

752
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,315
Scott, don't do this.

753
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:37,413
Jean, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay, it's me.

754
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,583
I'm so sorry.

755
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:44,503
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Oh, God.

756
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:49,846
I'm so sorry. I could see you, but I
couldn't stop myself. I tried. I'm sorry.

757
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:53,220
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

758
01:29:56,183 --> 01:29:58,476
- My leg.
- Easy. Easy.

759
01:29:58,535 --> 01:29:59,590
Scott.

760
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:04,648
Something's wrong.

761
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,785
My God.

762
01:30:17,075 --> 01:30:18,122
No!

763
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:24,794
Have you found the mutants yet?
Have you found all of them?

764
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:27,505
I'm trying. There are so many of them.

765
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:30,466
Then concentrate.

766
01:30:30,524 --> 01:30:32,851
<i>- Concentrate.
- Concentrate.</i>

767
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:40,554
The tricky thing about adamantium is

768
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:46,810
that if you ever manage
to process its raw, liquid form,

769
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:49,396
you gotta keep it that way.

770
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:52,816
Keep it hot.

771
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:56,904
Because once the metal cools,
it's indestructible.

772
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,909
But you already know that.

773
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:07,373
I used to think you were
one of a kind, Wolverine.

774
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:13,170
I was wrong.

775
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:33,732
Holy shit.

776
01:35:18,505 --> 01:35:20,047
That's it.

777
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:26,442
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm sick of this kid's table shit. I'm going in there.

778
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:29,139
John, they told us to stay here.

779
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:31,308
You always do as you're told?

780
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:36,915
<i>Find all the mutants.
All of them. Find them.</i>

781
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:41,920
<i>Find all the mutants. Everywhere.
Find them all. Each one. All of them.</i>

782
01:36:42,088 --> 01:36:43,964
- Good.
<i>- Kill them.</i>

783
01:37:32,524 --> 01:37:35,474
<i>Now, concentrate. Concentrate harder.</i>

784
01:37:35,642 --> 01:37:42,105
<i>Now find them all. Find all the mutants.
Concentrate harder. Each and every one.</i>

785
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:47,110
<i>Find all the mutants.
Kill them all. Find them all. Kill them.</i>

786
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:52,032
Cerebro...

787
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,202
We're too late.

788
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:06,255
Eric, hurry.

789
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:56,013
That's strange.

790
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:38,889
How does it look from there, Charles?
Still fighting the good fight?

791
01:39:39,766 --> 01:39:44,978
From here, it doesn't look like
they're playing by your rules.

792
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:48,190
Maybe it's time to play by theirs.

793
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:27,604
There's been a change of plan.

794
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,792
Goodbye, Charles.

795
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:07,310
There's been a change of plans.

796
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:13,150
<i>Now find them. Focus. Find them all.
The humans. Find all of them.</i>

797
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:15,944
<i>Every one.</i>

798
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:36,882
How does it feel, bub?

799
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:43,430
- Why did you come back?
- You cut me open. You took my life.

800
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:47,100
You make it sound as if
I stole something from you.

801
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:51,730
As I recall, it was you
who volunteered for the procedure.

802
01:41:51,898 --> 01:41:53,273
Who am I?

803
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:58,153
You are just a failed experiment.

804
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,242
If you really knew about your past,

805
01:42:04,261 --> 01:42:08,723
what kind of person you were,
the work we did together...

806
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:12,501
People don't change, Wolverine.

807
01:42:12,668 --> 01:42:15,837
You were an animal then.
You're an animal now.

808
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:18,632
I just gave you claws.

809
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,241
What the hell is that?

810
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:47,744
- What is it?
- The dam's ruptured.

811
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:52,582
It's gonna flood water into the spillway.
It's trying to relieve the pressure.

812
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:57,087
It's too late. In a few minutes
we'll all be underwater.

813
01:42:57,255 --> 01:42:59,881
Come with me,
and I'll tell you all you want to know.

814
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:04,052
You can't help your friends.
They're as good as dead, Wolverine.

815
01:43:04,554 --> 01:43:06,596
You're a survivor.

816
01:43:06,764 --> 01:43:09,015
Always have been.

817
01:43:09,475 --> 01:43:13,270
I thought I was just an animal with claws.

818
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:19,442
If we die, you die.

819
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:30,996
There are no answers that way, Wolverine.

820
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:35,083
<i>Find all the humans. Each and every one.</i>

821
01:43:35,251 --> 01:43:38,712
<i>Find them. Find all the humans. Kill them.</i>

822
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:44,801
- What is this?
- Cerebro.

823
01:43:46,477 --> 01:43:47,555
Storm.

824
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:52,100
- Jean, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

825
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:53,852
What's happening?

826
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,855
Professor's still in there,
with another mutant.

827
01:43:56,882 --> 01:43:59,967
He's trapped in some kind of illusion.

828
01:44:01,027 --> 01:44:05,739
Oh my God. Magneto's reversed Cerebro.
It's not targeting mutants any more.

829
01:44:05,907 --> 01:44:09,743
- Who is it targeting?
- Everyone else.

830
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:28,720
Impossible.

831
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:59,125
- Everybody, stand back.
- Scott, no. His mind is connected to Cerebro.

832
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:02,545
Opening the door could kill him
and everyone his mind is linked to.

833
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:05,882
Wait. Kurt, I need you to take me inside.

834
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,051
Storm, who is this guy? Who are you?

835
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:10,929
My name is Kurt Wagner,
but in the Munich circus...

836
01:45:11,097 --> 01:45:13,223
He's a teleporter.

837
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:17,143
I told you. If I can't
see where I'm going...

838
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:19,562
I have faith in you.

839
01:45:22,692 --> 01:45:25,944
Don't believe anything you see in there.

840
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:34,077
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

841
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:37,163
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on Earth...

842
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:40,625
as it is in heaven.

843
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:53,346
Hello.

844
01:45:54,974 --> 01:45:57,642
What are you looking for?

845
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:02,272
Professor, can you hear me?

846
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:04,733
You've got to stop Cerebro now.

847
01:46:05,818 --> 01:46:08,403
Who are you talking to?

848
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,573
No, don't move.

849
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:14,284
But she's just a little girl.

850
01:46:14,452 --> 01:46:16,453
No, she's not.

851
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:21,916
I've got my eyes on you.

852
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:29,174
Mr Stryker.

853
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:33,386
Funny we keep running into each other.

854
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:36,598
Mark my words, it'll never happen again.

855
01:46:40,478 --> 01:46:43,730
Kurt, it's about to get very cold in here.

856
01:46:44,356 --> 01:46:46,941
I'm not going anywhere.

857
01:46:53,284 --> 01:46:54,785
What are you doing?

858
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:36,741
<i>Find all the humans.
Kill them. Every single one of them.</i>

859
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:41,663
<i>Focus. Focus. Find all the humans.</i>

860
01:47:51,132 --> 01:47:52,382
Stop it!

861
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:03,768
Jason.

862
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:07,188
He's gonna be so angry at me.

863
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:38,511
Logan, where are you?

864
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:11,002
We have to get out through the spillway.

865
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:52,502
You don't wanna go that way. Trust me.

866
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:05,390
Come on, there's another way out of here.

867
01:50:38,171 --> 01:50:40,717
The helicopter was right here.

868
01:51:23,927 --> 01:51:26,721
- I will take him.
- Okay.

869
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:58,044
It's okay, Rogue. It's okay.
You can let go, honey. Let go.

870
01:51:58,212 --> 01:52:00,588
- Go. I'll be fine.
- You sure?

871
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,771
Who has the answers, Wolverine?

872
01:52:17,606 --> 01:52:19,649
Those people?

873
01:52:19,817 --> 01:52:21,984
That creature in your arms?

874
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:40,211
I'll take my chances with him.

875
01:52:42,131 --> 01:52:46,342
One day someone will finish
what I've started, Wolverine.

876
01:52:46,392 --> 01:52:48,351
One day!

877
01:52:49,928 --> 01:52:51,084
One day!

878
01:52:57,123 --> 01:52:58,029
Scott.

879
01:52:58,897 --> 01:53:01,399
We've got to get to Washington.

880
01:53:04,236 --> 01:53:07,363
I fear this has gone beyond Alkali Lake.

881
01:53:08,627 --> 01:53:09,627
- Bobby.
- Hey.

882
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:11,909
I got him.

883
01:53:13,579 --> 01:53:15,580
You okay?

884
01:53:16,582 --> 01:53:18,583
I am now.

885
01:53:25,883 --> 01:53:27,803
- What's wrong?
- Vertical thrusters are offline.

886
01:53:27,968 --> 01:53:28,991
- So fix it.
- I'm trying.

887
01:53:29,054 --> 01:53:31,242
- Hey, has anyone seen John?
- No.

888
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:34,015
Pyro? Where the hell is he?

889
01:53:34,183 --> 01:53:36,684
He's with Magneto.

890
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:44,400
Come on.

891
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:47,028
- Oh, no. We've lost the power.
- Come on.

892
01:53:57,498 --> 01:54:00,833
There's power in the fuel cells...

893
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:51,259
- Storm, we need some kind of external power.
- Jean?

894
01:54:52,344 --> 01:54:54,220
Where's Jean?

895
01:54:55,806 --> 01:54:57,890
She's outside.

896
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:14,073
No, we're not leaving. Lower the ramp.

897
01:55:28,213 --> 01:55:30,798
Storm, lower it.

898
01:55:30,966 --> 01:55:32,174
I can't.

899
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:57,116
She's controlling the jet.

900
01:56:02,173 --> 01:56:05,541
- You, get her, now.
- She's not letting me.

901
01:56:05,709 --> 01:56:06,876
Dammit.

902
01:56:14,468 --> 01:56:17,136
I know what I'm doing.

903
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:19,138
- This is...
- ...the only way.

904
01:56:21,767 --> 01:56:23,434
Jean...

905
01:56:23,602 --> 01:56:25,561
Listen to me.

906
01:56:26,938 --> 01:56:28,606
Don't do this.

907
01:56:28,774 --> 01:56:30,656
Goodbye.

908
01:56:30,696 --> 01:56:31,993
Oh, no, no!

909
01:56:33,649 --> 01:56:34,462
No!

910
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:01,514
She's gone.

911
01:57:03,754 --> 01:57:04,707
She's gone.

912
01:57:04,768 --> 01:57:07,895
Don't you say that. We gotta go back.

913
01:57:08,063 --> 01:57:10,022
- She's gone.
- No!

914
01:57:10,915 --> 01:57:12,415
No.

915
01:57:29,751 --> 01:57:32,545
She's gone. She's gone. She's...

916
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:37,790
She's gone.

917
01:57:49,271 --> 01:57:52,523
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

918
01:57:52,691 --> 01:57:56,152
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

919
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:59,989
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of the death,

920
01:58:00,157 --> 01:58:04,160
I will fear no evil,

921
01:58:04,327 --> 01:58:06,829
for Thou art with me.

922
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:22,052
"Today I've been given an opportunity
to shed light on recent occurrences

923
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:24,346
from the attack that ended in this office..."

924
01:58:24,514 --> 01:58:27,568
Good morning. "...to the unexplained
phenomenon that swept the Earth,

925
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:29,226
"nearly annihilating our way of life."

926
01:58:29,394 --> 01:58:31,394
Good morning. Do we like
this word, "annihilating"?

927
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:36,025
Good morning.

928
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:41,113
- Good morning, Mr President.
- Thank you.

929
01:58:47,704 --> 01:58:49,830
Mr President, we're live in five,

930
01:58:49,850 --> 01:58:51,851
four, three, two...

931
01:58:55,170 --> 01:59:01,550
My fellow Americans, in this time of
adversity we are being offered a moment.

932
01:59:01,593 --> 01:59:05,139
A moment to recognise
a growing threat in our own population

933
01:59:05,273 --> 01:59:09,234
and take a unique role
in the shape of human events.

934
01:59:14,523 --> 01:59:17,983
Did we just lose the feed?
Are we still live?

935
01:59:52,269 --> 01:59:54,687
Good morning, Mr President.

936
01:59:56,898 --> 02:00:00,651
Please, don't be alarmed.
We're not going to harm anyone.

937
02:00:01,236 --> 02:00:03,445
Who are you people?

938
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:06,448
We're mutants.
My name is Charles Xavier.

939
02:00:06,616 --> 02:00:09,285
- Please, sit down.
- I'd rather stand.

940
02:00:09,578 --> 02:00:11,161
Rogue.

941
02:00:12,289 --> 02:00:17,167
These files were taken from
the private offices of William Stryker.

942
02:00:26,778 --> 02:00:27,990
How did you get this?

943
02:00:28,068 --> 02:00:34,143
Well, let's just say I know a little girl
who can walk through walls.

944
02:00:42,444 --> 02:00:44,784
- I've never seen this information.
- I know.

945
02:00:44,863 --> 02:00:46,988
Then you also know
I don't respond well to threats.

946
02:00:47,027 --> 02:00:50,492
Mr President, this is not a threat.
This is an opportunity.

947
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:55,998
There are forces in this world, both mutant and
human alike, who believe that a war is coming.

948
02:00:57,584 --> 02:01:02,171
You will see from those files
that some have already tried to start one.

949
02:01:02,206 --> 02:01:07,635
And there have been casualties,
losses on both sides.

950
02:01:12,891 --> 02:01:15,184
Mr President.

951
02:01:16,384 --> 02:01:20,356
What you are about to tell the
world is true. This is a moment.

952
02:01:20,523 --> 02:01:27,154
A moment to repeat the mistakes of the past,
or to work together for a better future.

953
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:30,532
We're here to stay, Mr President.

954
02:01:30,593 --> 02:01:32,743
The next move is yours.

955
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:36,121
We'll be watching.

956
02:01:55,266 --> 02:01:57,142
Mr President?

957
02:02:24,254 --> 02:02:28,554
You know, even when Jean was a student,

958
02:02:28,711 --> 02:02:31,969
she was always hesitant about her powers.

959
02:02:32,137 --> 02:02:34,596
Always looking to others.

960
02:02:36,307 --> 02:02:41,895
Feeling that in some way
she was left behind.

961
02:02:49,112 --> 02:02:51,655
Could we have done more to save her?

962
02:02:53,116 --> 02:02:57,119
In the past, she may have let us.

963
02:02:58,038 --> 02:03:00,748
There had to be another way.

964
02:03:00,915 --> 02:03:03,292
Why did she leave the plane?

965
02:03:06,463 --> 02:03:09,548
Because she made a choice.

966
02:03:12,135 --> 02:03:14,553
Yes, come on in.

967
02:03:25,053 --> 02:03:26,530
Hey, hey.

968
02:03:29,319 --> 02:03:30,986
Listen.

969
02:03:31,154 --> 02:03:33,155
She did make a choice.

970
02:03:35,325 --> 02:03:37,326
It was you.

971
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:12,736
Professor?

972
02:04:12,904 --> 02:04:14,863
Is everything all right?

973
02:04:17,742 --> 02:04:20,494
Yes, I think it will be.

974
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:27,251
Now, tell me, have any of you read a book
by an English novelist named T.H. White

975
02:04:27,418 --> 02:04:29,962
called The Once and Future King?

976
02:04:30,926 --> 02:04:32,129
Nobody?

977
02:04:32,793 --> 02:04:33,754
Well...

978
02:04:38,847 --> 02:04:42,641
<i>Mutation: it is the key to our evolution.</i>

979
02:04:42,809 --> 02:04:45,727
<i>It is how we have evolved
from a single-celled organism</i>

980
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:48,856
<i>into the dominant species on the planet.</i>

981
02:04:49,023 --> 02:04:54,278
<i>This process is slow, normally taking
thousands and thousands of years.</i>

982
02:04:54,429 --> 02:04:57,577
<i>But every few hundred millennia</i>

983
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:00,335
<i>evolution leaps forward.</i>
