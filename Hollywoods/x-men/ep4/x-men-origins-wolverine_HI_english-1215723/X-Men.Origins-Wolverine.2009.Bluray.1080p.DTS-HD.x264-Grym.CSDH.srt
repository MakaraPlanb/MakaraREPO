only action here, General.

845
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:38,915
The days of our country sitting
on the sidelines are over.

846
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:41,292
We need to take
the fight to the enemy

847
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,920
before they take
the fight to us.

848
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,421
I admire your passion,
I do.

849
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:46,839
Thank you.

850
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,926
But this is as
far as it goes.

851
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,678
Weapon X was a hiccup.

852
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,513
We know about
your son, Bill.

853
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:58,684
We know he's a mutant, and
we know he killed your wife.

854
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00,019
You shouldn't have
kept that from us.

855
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,562
That...

856
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,107
That has nothing to do
with my work, General.

857
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,525
Bullshit.

858
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,444
You're too close to this.

859
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:10,112
I'm shutting you down.

860
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:15,284
Okay. You're right.
I won't lie to you.

861
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:22,416
My son did bring
the problem home for me,

862
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,711
but I took an oath

863
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,465
to protect
the American people

864
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:33,552
from every threat,
both foreign

You don't like flying, huh?
I'm fine.

868
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,573
Just concentrate on what you're doing.
You sure?

869
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,283
You got a bit of sweat
on your brow there.

870
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:57,994
Very funny. Just keep
your eyes on the...

871
01:14:58,077 --> 01:14:59,829
On the what? The clouds?
Keep my eyes on the clouds?

872

You're up and down
like a freaking yo-yo here!

873
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,790
Where'd you get
this thing, anyway?

874
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,000
Oh, this is my baby.

875
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,794
I won her in a game.
Jacks over fives.

876
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,380

No one's gonna snoop
around a nuclear reactor.

881
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,025
They think it's gonna turn
them into freaks.

882

883
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,235
Right.

About time.

887
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:50,880
Hey, if it makes you feel any
better, this is really gonna hurt.

888
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,799
Well, yeah, it kind
of does, actually.

889
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,887
Good luck.
Likewise.

890
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:01,348
Oh, shit.

891
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,317
How you doing?
Everything all right?

892
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,195
Is he ready yet?

893
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:15,404
A few more hours.

894
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:16,989
And he will respond
to my commands?

895
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,200
Absolutely.

896
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:23,639
Logan.

897
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,017
Welcome back to the war.

898
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:30,896
Before I gut you,
I want to know why.

899
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,900
I needed your powers
for the Pool.

900
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,152
For the what?

901
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:37,903

902

Deadpool.

903
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,159
Years of searching
and refining,

904
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:47,204
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body

905
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,456
without ripping it apart.

906
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:53,419
My son was the first
piece of the puzzle.

907
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,381
Logan, you were the last.

908
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,717
You made Weapon XI possible.

909
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:05,973
I asked you to help, but you
said you wanted the quiet life.

910
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,310
Well,

911
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,354
I've learned that
nothing motivates

912
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,982
the men in your
family like revenge.

913
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:33,918
Who are you?

914
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,962

You're a dangerous man.

We like to keep an eye

Tell him about

920
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:09,411
They gave me a shot
of hydrochlorothiazide.

921
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:15,167
It reduces the heart rate so
low it appears you flatlined.

She's a real credit

Did you know that her sister
has diamond-hard skin?

926
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,112
Kayla's mutation
is tactohypnosis.

927
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,782
She can influence people
as long as she touches them.

928
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,493
Quite a useful tool
in a seduction.

929
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,912
It was never real,
my friend.

930
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,211
It was real for me.

931
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,631
I told you if you
came down this road,

932
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:04,883
you wouldn't like
what you found.

933
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:16,729
That story you told me about a man
who gets flowers for the moon,

934
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,649
I had it backwards.

935
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:27,323
I thought you were the moon
and I was your Wolverine.

But you're the trickster,
aren't you?

937
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:35,414
I'm just the fool
who got played.

938
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:40,419
The worst part of it is,
I should have known.

939
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,758
But I ignored my instincts.

940
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,638
I ignored what I really am.

941
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:58,771

ever happen again.

you'd let her go.

as simple as that.
