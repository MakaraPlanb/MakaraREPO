00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,113
Or maybe an explorer.

523
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,492
-Hola, Dora.
-Hi, I'm Dora, and--

524
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,162
-Wait, you already knew my name?
-[footsteps approach]

525
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,748
Hey. You gotta help me.

526
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,084
I guess we win the scavenger hunt.

527
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,711
What? Hey, no.

528
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,880
Let me go!

529
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,592
-Hey, no!
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

530
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,261
-[Diego] What's going on?
-[Randy] Is this a scavenger hunt?

531
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,721
[Dora]
What are you guys doing in here?

532
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,389
[coughing]

533
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,975
Sleep tight, Dora,
and when you wake up,

534
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:51,063
you will help us find your parents,
and then Parapata.

535
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,484
[sinister whispering]

536
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,031
[snorts]

537
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,201
What's happening?

538
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,620
Where are we?

539
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,122
[footsteps]

540
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,000
[clicking, clattering]

541
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,382
I think we're being unloaded from a plane.

542
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,384
We're not on a plane. We can't--

543
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,681
Oh, my God, we're on a plane!
Oh--

544
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,393
We've left the country without ID.
We need to alert the US consulate.

545
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,737
Dora, what happened?

546
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,574
[speaking Spanish]

547
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,867
[speaks Spanish]

548
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,161
-They're treasure hunters?
-Why did I take Mandarin?

549
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,414
-What are you guys saying?
-[whirring, clattering]

550
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,792
We gotta get out of here.

551
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,381
Oh, look, Dora brought a knife
on the field trip, everybody.

552
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,883
[Dora strains]

553
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,305
I see three mercenaries. Armed.

554
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,390
Wait, there's a fourth.

555
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,143
I think he saw me.

556
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,145
-He's coming for us.
-Ah!

557
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:18,191
Okay. I am not here.
I'm an avatar. [whimpers]

558
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,111
[Randy screams]

559
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,656
Dora! It is you!

560
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,492
-Who are you?
-I'm a friend of your parents.

561
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,952
I'm rescuing you, Dora!

562
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,370
Come with me if you want to live--

563
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:31,913
[grunts]

564
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,875
-[Sammy] Where did he go?
-Did… did he die?

565
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,587
I'm okay! I'm okay.
I need your help.

566
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,881
But we have to run. Now!

567
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,928
-[woman] Boss!
-Get them!

568
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,266
[Sammy] My parents did not sign
a permission slip for the jungle!

569
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,893
Why are we here?

570
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,520
Where's the museum?
Why, why, why?

571
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,398
-[Dora] How do we get out of here?
-I don't know!

572
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,776
Getting you out of the box
was as far as my plan went.

573
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,110
Huh?

574
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,404
[whistles]

575
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,241
Huh! Swiper, at the ready!

576
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,786
Whatever happens, get that map.

577
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,288
Swiper, yes, swiping.

578
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,833
-[Diego] What kind of rescue is this?
-It's the only one you've got.

579
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,251
[Dora] Here. Let me try.

580
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,170
Hola.
What the--

581
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,466
[Dora] Hey! That fox just swiped my map!

582
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,218
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

583
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,595
What part of, "The fox just swiped
my map" don't you understand?

584
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,596
Come on, help me!

585
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,392
Gotcha! There you are, my little friend.

586
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,061
No swiping, you… you swiper!

587
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,278
Yeah, oh! Oh! [moaning]

588
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,488
Oh!

589
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,327
She's amazing.

590
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,703
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh-oh!

591
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,581
-[Swiper screams]
-Oh, shoot!

592
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,462
Man! I'm stuck upside-down.

593
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,176
Swiper, no-- [gasps]

594
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,430
-Good job, Swiper.
-I know, man.

595
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,806
Get her!

596
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,059
[Diego] Dora!

597
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,771
-Now what do we do?
-Come on, come on!

598
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,191
-Where did our rescuer go?
-[Randy] He ran away!

599
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,695
-Get in!
-[Swiper] Open this door, man!

600
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,530
-[man] Get in!
-[Swiper] I'm not joking, man!

601
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,742
Viper, get the truck!
Don't let them escape!

602
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,204
-Hold on!
-[Diego] Oh!

603
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,747
[all screaming]

604
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,424
[man] Sorry!

605
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,345
[all grunt, groan]

606
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,307
Are they following?

607
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,104
[mercenary]
Where have they gone?

608
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,065
This is the only road for miles.
Keep your eyes peeled.

609
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,902
Not anymore. [sighs]

610
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,070
Are you kids okay?

611
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,947
[vomits]

612
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,992
Oh.

613
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,036
-Not really.
-"Not really"?

614
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,913
Understatement of the century.

615
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,415
I was just kidnapped
and chased by bad guys!

616
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,585
And a fox with a mask!
Everyone saw that, right?

617
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,754
Like, why does that fox
need to remain anonymous?

618
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,131
Who is gonna recognize
one specific fox?

619
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,717
-Mm.
-How did you know my name?

620
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,886
You were an infant
the last time I saw you.

621
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,056
My name is Alejandro Gutierrez.
I'm a professor of ancient languages

622
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,974
at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru.

623
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,811
Your parents and I were in constant
contact during their time here.

624
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,649
Then two weeks ago,
your parents' calls stopped.

625
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,108
Since then…

626
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:48,777
silencio.

627
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,488
-That means silence.
-Yeah. I got that one.

628
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,949
They haven't answered any
of my sat phone call for weeks, either.

629
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,077
Your father sent me this
just a week before, in case I could help.

630
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,620
Ah, Papi's journal!

631
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,664
[Alejandro] So I came here
to make sure they were okay.

632
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:01,998
Tracked them this far.

633
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,085
I've been staking it out,
hoping for a sign from them.

634
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,963
[stutters] And then I saw you poke
your head out of that crate

635
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,257
and I-- I said to myself, "Dora!"

636
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,093
Dora the kidnapped teenager!

637
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,345
But how did you recognize me?

638
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,515
Well, you look sort of exactly the same.

639
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,811
But I'm afraid I have no idea
where to find your parents.

640
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,146
Don't worry. I can track
my parents in the jungle.

641
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,274
-Let's go!
-Ho… Hold up.

642
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,442
Or we could call the local police

643
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,987
and-- and have them come rescue us
with, like, a SWAT team.

644
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,406
Hmm. Yeah, that sounds like
another solid option.

645
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,991
Of course!

646
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,785
Hello? 911?
Can you please come and get us?

647
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,913
We're at the corner of Rain and Forest.

648
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,000
Okay, I get it!
I just want to go home.

649
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,043
We're gonna die out here.

650
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:48,878
Look around you.

651
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,424
This is the kind of place
where people die.

652
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,386
I mean, in a way, every place
is the kind of place where people die.

653
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,014
-Okay, well, that's a bummer notion.
-Guys, guys.

654
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,892
Listen, finding Dora's parents
is our best chance of getting home.

655
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,270
My aunt and uncle
will know what to do.

656
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,148
Dora's my cousin, I can't just
let her go off with some

657
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,317
strange and anxious man we just met.

658
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,776
Thank you, Diego.

659
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,528
Now let's go find Dora's parents.

660
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,655
[starts engine]

661
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,421
[Dora] Look! In there! That's their car!

662
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,225
Here. This is it. Our family symbol.

663
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,811
-This is where they started hiking.
-Are we there?

664
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,522
Where are your parents?
I don't see your parents.

665
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,108
We can't go any further by car.

666
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,527
-The jungle gets too dense.
-So, how do we--

667
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,863
We must enter the jungle on foot.

668
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,533
Luckily, I prepared for this possibility.

669
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,703
[chuckles]

670
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,373
Okay, I may have gone
a little overboard on supplies.

671
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,582
Be my guest.

672
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,297
This is a legit nightmare!

673
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:23,348
I-- I'm not going in first, though.
You go first, Dora. It feels right.

674
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,394
[Dora] You all have nothing
to worry about.

675
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,437
The jungle is perfectly safe!

676
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,525
Just don't touch anything.
Or breathe too deeply.

677
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:38,863
Oh.

678
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,199
[whimpers]

679
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,290
[Randy] Are you sure
your parents went this way?

680
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,961
[Sammy] Okay, what are these?

681
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:54,963
Warning signs.

682
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,173
Totems.

683
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,676
Legend tells
of a deadly ancient militia

684
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,679
dedicated to protecting Parapata
from outside eyes.

685
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,348
No one has seen
Los Guardianes Perdidos…

686
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,934
The Lost Guardians, for centuries.

687
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:14,733
[speaking Quechua]

688
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,610
-What was that?
-Quechua.

689
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,948
-Ancient Inca. Impressive.
-[Sammy] What does it mean?

690
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,618
"All those that seek Parapata…

691
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,747
shall surely perish."

692
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,708
Okay, I am ready for my parents
to come and get me now.

693

00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,800
-Of course, we'll have to start a family.
-We are not starting a family.

866
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,802
Eh, give it a few days.

867
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,931
Uh! Hey! Where have you guys been?

868
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,060
-[Alejandro] Hi, guys.
-Look, I'm really sorry, Dora.

869
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,978
It's fine. It's fine, Sammy.

870
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,023
We saw the mercenaries.
They're ahead of us.

871
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,400
We'll have to follow the mercenaries
from a safe distance.

872
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:45,071
No. We're not following them.
My parents didn't go that way.

873
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:48,449
My father says that the way to Parapata
passes through an opera house.

874
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,242
The opera house was built
hundreds of years ago

875
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,577
by Europeans during the rubber boom.

876
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,329
There'll be nothing but ruins by now.

877
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,456
This is the way they went.

878
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,503
This must be it.

879
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,089
Or was it.

880
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,345
It doesn't look like any opera singers
have been here for a while.

881
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,305
Yeah. [chuckles]

882
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,391
The Europeans may have built it, but…

883
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,060
the jungle has taken it back.

884
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:21,982
[singing lyrics from
"Phantom of the Opera"]

885
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,904
-[farting sound]
-Ew, my feet.

886
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,656
Why does the ground
feel like chocolate pudding?

887
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,408
-[farting sound]
-Excuse me.

888
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,826
[all making farting sound]

889
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,702
-[laughing]
-[Alejandro] Wait, wait, wait!

890
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,663
I ate a lot of frijoles and chimichangas.

891
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,541
-[farting sound]
-[all laughing]

892
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,460
-I ate chile con carne.
-[farting sound]

893
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,130
[laughter]

894
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,173
[Alejandro] I ate mucho pozole.

895
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,134
-[farting sound, laughter]
-Um…

896
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:53,013
Wait. Anyone else notice
the walls are getting higher?

897
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,684
-Quicksand!
-[Sammy yelps]

898
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,815
-You got to be kidding me!
-[Randy] Quicksand really exists?

899
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,109
I thought it was just a video game thing.

900
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:06,944
Like Pitfall!

901
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,197
-It's a classic.
-How do we get out of this stuff?

902
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,451
Okay, rule number one of quicksand,
don't panic.

903
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,455
You'll only get sucked in further.
Lie down flat on your back.

904
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,291
You have to distribute your weight.

905
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,917
Okay. All right.

906
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,755
[Alejandro]
No, no, no. I'm not doing that.

907
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,674
Yeah. No, this feels super wrong.

908
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,968
[Dora] Now make little movements
with your legs

909
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,512
to make space for the water
to get between the sand.

910
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,475
And once your legs are free,
simply backstroke out of the quicksand.

911
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,144
Oh, give me a break.
We're gonna die in here.

912
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,314
[all panting]

913
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,859
Look, look! It's working! It's working!

914
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:54,950
Come on.

915
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,412
[gasping, panting]

916
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,334
Thanks.

917
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,254
-Help me!
-Alejandro, you have to stop moving.

918
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,422
Stay sti--

919
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,259
Why have you all gone quiet?

920
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:17,097
It's bad, isn't it? [yelps]

921
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,350
Oh, no! Shoo!

922
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:26,232
Cha! [spits]
No, no, no! Not on the face.

923
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,859
-Not on the face. Ah! [yells in Spanish]
-Oh!

924
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,988
-It's another male. They will now fight.
-No, no!

925
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,407
-Ah!
-[chirping]

926
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,536
I'm not sure those guys are fighting.

927
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,746
Oh, it's a female.

928
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,666
They are not fighting. They are mating!

929
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,543
[screams]

930
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,628
-Get it off!
-Quick, someone go get a branch.

931
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,090
-I'm sinking!
-No, no, wait!

932
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,717
Guys, come back!

933
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,053
[Diego] It's a jungle full of trees
and I can't find a branch.

934
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,388
[Sammy] Oh, oh, no!

935
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,140
[Dora] Alejandro! Alejandro!

936
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,768
I see feet. Human feet!

937
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,228
Over here!

938
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:10,234
[Dora yelps] Okay, everyone.
One, two, three! Ah!

939
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,574
[laughter]

940
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:18,951
[coughs]

941
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,667
-I'm alive?
-[both] Yes!

942
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:30,129
-I'm alive! I'm alive!
-Yes! Yes!

943
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,591
-I'm alive! I'm alive! [laughing]
-Yes! [chuckling]

944
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,596
[sobbing] I'm alive, I'm alive…

945
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,350
I thought I was gonna die.

946
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,062
I thought I was gonna die.

947
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,692
It's so awkward when adults cry.

948
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,902
You just don't know where to look.

949
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,030
And I was stupid!

950
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,992
And then a scorpion went…

951
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,621
mating on my head.

952
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,664
[sobbing]

953
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,462
I'm so sorry. My whole life is a lie.

954
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,714
I'm a fraud.

955
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,591
-No! No.
-Yes.

956
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,844
Everyone thinks that sometimes, Alejandro.

957
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,137
I'm a bad guy.

958
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:21,680
-No.
-Yes.

959
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,475
-No. No. No.
-No, yes, I am. Yes.

960
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:28,145
-I'm a-- I'm a bad guy! [scoffs]
-No!

961
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,691
No, you are not a bad guy.
No one is, deep down inside.

962
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:37,237
-Thank you, Dora.
-Come on.

963
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:39,990
Where are we?

964
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,368
Someone lives here.

965
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,121
And that someone's coming.

966
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,346
[woman speaking Quechua]

967
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,348
She hasn't seen my parents.

968
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:09,144
And she doesn't seem very interested
in helping me find them.

969
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,230
Perhaps she knows
how to get to Parapata.

970
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,606
Parapata!

971
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,068
[Sammy yelps]
She seemed pretty interested in that.

972
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,070
[grunting]

973
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,121
Are they supposed to be us?

974
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,873
[all yelping]

975
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,211
[woman grunts]

976
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:37,506
Yah!

977
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,430
That seemed bad, right?

978
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,849
-Everyone thinks that was bad?
-Yeah, a little bit.

979
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,269
[speaking Quechua]

980
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,522
[woman continues]

981
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,994
What? What did she say?

982
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:10,748
She said anyone
seeking Parapata is cursed.

983
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,916
-Well, that's great.
-[Diego sighs]

984
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,086
But she also said she knows
how to get you guys back downriver.

985
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,172
-She can take you home.
-[scoffs]

986
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,465
All of you.

987
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,926
Yes. Yes! I am saved! I…

988
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:27,389
mean… [clears throat] …only if you are
cool without us, obviously.

989
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,268
You got me into this mess,
but I guess you're getting me out of it,

990
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,187
so we'll call it even.

991
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,400
I'm coming with you.
I can't let you go alone.

992
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,695
I mean, plus you're my cousin.
There's, like, rules about that.

993
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,699
[grunts]

994
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,412
This is where we split up.

995
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,214
Oh, my…

996
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,346
I, uh… I hope you don't die or anything.

997
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,098
You, too.

998
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,984
Is she staring at us?

999
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,278
-Yeah.
-Okay, time to go.

1000
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,407
Diego, Dora, let's go.

1001
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,993
[speaking Quechua]

1002
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,205
-Hmm?
-She says stick to the path.

1003
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,958
Oh. Let's go. Bye, guys.

1004
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,043
Good luck, Dora.

1005
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,096
-[speaking Quechua]
-Why is she in such a hurry

1006
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,305
to get us out of here?

1007
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,727
[speaking Quechua]

1008
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,188
Randy, wait, stop.

1009
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,232
Oh, no. Oh, no!

1010
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,651
No, no, no, come on!
We've got to warn them!

1011
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,904
[speaking Quechua]

1012
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,207
Not something you see every day.

1013
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:20,294
[Alejandro]
Are you sure about this?

1014
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,922
[Dora] Well, she said this was the way
we had to go.

1015
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:29,219
Don't touch anything.

1016
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,796
[both exhaling]

1017
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,592
Yes! Yes! Yes! We did it!

1018
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,554
[Alejandro] Oops.

1019
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,357
[groans]

1020
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,401
[Alejandro] It spat in my face! [grunts]

1021
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,654
-We're in a spore field!
-Don't breathe it in!

1022
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,031
-Let's get out of here!
-It's okay. It's okay.

1023
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,325
If these were poisonous spores,
we'd all be dead by now.

1024
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,370
Come on, Diego-- Oh, whoa.

1025
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,622
What?

1026
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,250
-What? What?
-Oh, boy.

1027
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:44,920
[screams]

1028
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,380
What's happening?

1029
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,507
-You… You look weird.
-You look weird.

1030
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:49,925
-No, you look weird.
-You-- No, you.

1031
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,594
-No, you! You!
-You! You! Him!

1032
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:53,637
[all scream]

1033
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:56,723
[speaking Spanish]

1034
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,184
I don't need these clothes anymore!

1035
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,269
-[Dora] Oh!
-[Alejandro yells in Spanish]

1036
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,771
[Alejandro laughs] Blech!

1037
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,107
I'm sure this will pass. It's fine!

1038
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,733
Fine? Are you kidding me?

1039
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,944
This is incredible! [grunts]

1040
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,989
Hi, Dora!

1041
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,700
Hi there, Map! Oh, I thought I lost you.

1042
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:18,203
You can never lose me.
I'm always with you!

1043
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,371
-Hi, Dora.
-[gasps]

1044
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:20,539
Backpack!

1045
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:22,290
My mouth is a zipper!

1046
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,459
-Hi, Dora.
-Hmm.

1047
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,628
-I don't know you, small rock.
-Oh.

1048
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,256
-But it's nice to make your acquaintance.
-Ah.

1049
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:30,590
Everyone is here!

1050
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,093
-[all cheering]
-Whoo-hoo!

1051
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,262
[both gasp]

1052
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,265
Look! Papi's journal!

1053
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,600
Wait!

1054
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,394
[Dora screams]

1055
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,479
Oh!

1056
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,732
-[grunts]
-You okay, Dora?

1057
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,609
I can't. I'm not ready.

1058
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,112
Take my hand. Let's try this together.

1059
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,531
Yay!

1060
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,953
[Dora screams]

1061
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,833
[Dora] Sammy! Randy!

1062
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,001
[both] We've got you, Dora.

1063
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,878
Thanks, guys!

1064
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,969
-[Randy] What do we do?
-[Sammy] Oh, we should sing her a song.

1065
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,345
She likes songs.

1066
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,182
♪ Please be alive, Dora, don't be dead ♪

1067
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:23,226
♪ That sounds like something
That you would have said ♪

1068
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,228
[vocalizing]

1069
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,856
-Oh, I'm not very good at this.
-[Randy] It worked!

1070
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,524
She's waking up.

1071
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,068
Hey!

1072
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,820
-Randy?
-Oh, thank goodness.

1073
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,989
-[Boots grunts softly]
-Boots!

1074
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,032
Oh.

1075
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,659
Sammy!

1076
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,578
-Hi.
-You came back.

1077
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,956
-You have a nice voice.
-[Sammy] Well…

1078
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,250
sometimes a song's the best idea.

1079
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,376
Oh.

1080
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,922
But not often.
Oh, and don't tell anyone I did that.

1081
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,883
You're going to be okay.

1082
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,617
You know, Dora,

1083
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,577
I…

1084
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,582
I never forgot about the jungle.

1085
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,584
And you…

1086
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,254
you were my best friend…

1087
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,757
and my-- my first friend.

1088
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,802
I'm glad I'm here with you, Dora.

1089
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,054
I mean, this…

1090
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,266
this is our next adventure, prima.

1091
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,810
Our next adventure, primo.

1092
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,105
[both laugh]

1093
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,441
[grunts]

1094
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,904
I-- I had the weirdest dream.

1095
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,324
[gasps]

1096
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:33,732
The entrance to Parapata should be
somewhere in these mountains.

1097
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:36,318
Oh, that's great. For the first time,

1098
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,904
I'm actually feeling really good
about how things are--

1099
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:41,031
[all yelling]

1100
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,783
[chirping]

1101
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:47,245
[all groaning, coughing]

1102
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,206
[Randy] Ignore what I just said.

1103
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,041
[all grunting, gasping]

1104
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,132
[Diego] Whoa.

1105
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,343
This was all hidden down here?

1106
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,931
[sighs] Well, great.
Now we're stuck in a hole.

1107
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,228
[Diego] Wow.

1108
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,272
Stars.

1109
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,441
[both] It's a star map.

1110
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:18,193
Classic us.

1111
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,529
But the stars aren't in the correct place.

1112
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,406
Awesome.

1113
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,576
It's a jungle puzzle! [laughs]

1114
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,371
I don't think this is a jungle puzzle.

1115
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:32,374
Mainly because there's no such thing
as a jungle puzzle.

1116
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,044
Listen, I've seen several movies
about the jungle.

1117
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,172
To solve this, we have to get
the stars in the right place.

1118
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,049
And when we do,
these big stone wheels will turn

1119
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,760
and the treasure will be revealed.
[chuckles] It's gonna be awesome.

1120
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:47,055
I just need to figure out
how to move the first piece.

1121
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,765
Oh.

1122
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,727
[grunting]

1123
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,854
Are you sure
you should be touching that?

1124
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,147
[clanking]

1125
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,108
-[Diego] What is that?
-[rattling]

1126
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,902
That does not sound like a good noise.

1127
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,406
Oh, wait. The stars
are in the right position.

1128
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,199
It's the southern hemisphere.

1129
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:11,246
-I was just looking at it the wrong way.
-It's still a jungle puzzle, right?

1130
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:13,206
[rumbling]

1131
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:16,584
Oh! Oh! I don't think
this is a jungle puzzle.

1132
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,796
-This is a puquio.
-[Sammy] What the flip is a puquio?

1133
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,923
It's an ancient underground aqueduct.

1134
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,885
Inca engineers built some of the most
elaborate irrigation systems ever devised.

1135
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,388
-Water, from above, using gravity.
-[ratcheting]

1136
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,181
-Oh!
-[gasps]

1137
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,351
-Oh, oh!
-Stop pulling levers, Randy! [screams]

1138
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,146
Ah! I'm trying to find the off switch!

1139
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,272
[dramatic music playing]

1140
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,065
[Sammy screams]

1141
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,359
[Randy screams]

1142
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:48,283
Okay, if this is an aqueduct, we just need
to somehow open the sluice gate.

1143
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,035
How do you know
so much about aqueducts?

1144
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,370
We learned about them
last year in history class.

1145
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,540
You were there. It was the week
you wore a lot of red and pink.

1146
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,918
I look at you a lot, okay?

1147
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,339
We need to find the sluice gate.
Where is the sluice gate?

1148
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,591
Please stop saying "sluice gate."

1149
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,136
[inhales deeply]

1150
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,222
[dramatic music continues]

1151
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,187
That must be the mechanism
that controls the sluice gate.

1152
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,690
That's what it's called, okay? We have
bigger thing to deal with right now!

1153
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,193
Everyone give me a hand.
It's gonna take all of us.

1154
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:28,073
-One, two, three!
-[all inhale]

1155
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:48,301
[all panting]

1156
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,804
This is our last chance.
It's now or never.

1157
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:53,515
-[gasps]
-Who here can hold their breath

1158
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,891
for seven minutes?

1159
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,477
It's hard to tell with all of this water,

1160
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,521
but I'm assuming none
of your hands are raised.

1161
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:02,065
This one's mine. [inhales]

1162
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,741
[all struggling]

1163
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,917
[yelping, panting]

1164
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,133
[dramatic music continues]

1165
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,015
[screaming]

1166
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,898
Oh!

1167
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,400
Whoa, ah!

1168
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,153
[screams]

1169
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,197
[Randy screams]

1170
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,032
[praying in Spanish]

1171
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,742
[Dora screams]

1172
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,744
Whoa!

1173
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,956
[screams]

1174
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,417
[screams]

1175
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:04,127
[screams] Whoa!

1176
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,928
[coughing]

1177
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,018
Dora!

1178
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,270
-Dora!
-[Cole] What?

1179
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,939
-[Elena] Oh, honey. Oh, honey!
-[Cole] Dora!

1180
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,691
-Mami!
-Oh!

1181
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,776
-My baby girl.
-[Cole] Honey! Honey!

1182
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,487
Hey! Oh!

1183
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,240
Randy did it! We're alive!

1184
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,118
-Tía, tío.
-Okay,

1185
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,745
can somebody please tell me
what's going on?

1186
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,456
We were kidnapped by mercenaries
who were after Parapata.

1187
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:45,376
Oh, I did something epic!
I'm basically a superhero!

1188
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,046
Oh!

1189
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,672
Hi, Dora's parents.

1190
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,008
Okay, honey,
who are all these people?

1191
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,761
We're Dora's friends. From school.

1192
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,931
-[Diego chuckles]
-Oh.

1193
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,267
It's fine. Fine.

1194
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,769
We're on a field trip.

1195
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,521
And where are the mercenaries?

1196
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,065
Alejandro saved us from them.
And he's with us!

1197
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,234
-Who?
-Your old friend.

1198
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,154
-Alejandro, from the university.
-You-- You sent him your journal.

1199
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,991
My journal was stolen
days before the expedition.

1200
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,409
-[radio beeps]
-Bravo team…

1201
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,621
this is Alpha leader.

1202
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:27,210
You don't know him, do you?

1203
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:28,962
[laughs]

1204
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,339
Oh. Miércoles.

1205
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:32,966
-We found them.
-[Elena] Honey, come here.

1206
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,510
-Get back, kids.
-Delta rendezvous point.

1207
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:37,303
You have my location.

1208
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:40,557

-Come on. I don't do last.

1380
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,409
[bird shrieks]

1381
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:37,129
It's empty.

1382
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,964
I don't get it.

1383
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,841
[Diego] I don't see any doors.

1384
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:43,052
This can't be all that there is.

1385
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:45,262
[Randy] I don't see any treasure.

1386
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:48,641
[Diego] It was probably cleaned out
by Spanish conquistadores.

1387
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:51,310
-Or the British.
-Or the French.

1388
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:53,646
Or the Americans
and the United Fruit Company.

1389
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,106
Oh! Ah!

1390
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,902
I found this bowl. Could be treasure.

1391
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,029
-That's a sun bowl.
-[Boots squeals]

1392
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,073
[Sammy] You tilt the bowls
to reflect the sunlight.

1393
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,866
So that must mean there's…

1394
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:09,620
Look! There's an opening
in the wall for the sun to shine in.

1395
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:13,374
[Dora] Well, this flashlight
can be our sun. Here, Boots.

1396
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,794
[Boots squeals]

1397
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,006
[Boots] Oh!

1398
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,218
-[Dora] Huh.
-Now what?

1399
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:27,429
We have to angle the bowl
to the right place in the room.

1400
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:34,144
-[Dora] Clearly, they loved geometry.
-[Sammy] They fit together symmetrically.

1401
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:37,231
[both]
The golden ratio! 51 degrees.

1402
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,108
[both laugh]

1403
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:43,654
Okay, Randy, angle your bowl 51 degrees
to Diego.

1404
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,656
Okay. [chuckles]

1405
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,783
Okay, Diego to me.

1406
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:50,703
-[gasps]
-[chuckles]

1407
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,496
[Randy] Yeah.

1408
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:54,373
Okay.

1409
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,542
Now, I'll turn mine 51 degrees

1410
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,460
and we'll see where it lands.

1411
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,134
[rumbling, cracking]

1412
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,053
[gasps] A door!
It's opening a door, guys.

1413
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,431
-[gasps]
-[chuckles]

1414
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:16,061
Just hold the beam
until the doors are fully open.

1415
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:21,608
What is that? Some sort
of Ancient Inca group hug?

1416
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:24,403
[screams]

1417
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:27,489
It slipped. I'm sorry.

1418
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:30,743
[loud groaning, crashing]

1419
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:34,204
-Oh, guys. You might want to look up.
-Huh?

1420
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:37,833
The jungle puzzles are turning on us!

1421
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,960
-The door's closing!
-Everyone run!

1422
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:41,962
[Randy screams]

1423
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:44,590
-Come on, Boots!
-[Boots screams]

1424
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,592
[Sammy screams]

1425
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,887
Dora, Dora! Try and pull it open.

1426
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,389
[all grunting]

1427
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,142
-It isn't enough!
-[Boots grunting]

1428
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:00,773
-[Dora strains]
-[ratcheting]

1429
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,903
Thank you! Thank you!

1430
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:09,073
Oh, Boots. [laughs]
Good job, buddy!

1431
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:12,451
Whoa. That's some hallway.

1432
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:15,788
[Diego] It's like it goes on forever.

1433
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:19,875
-At the end, is that--
-A giant golden monkey? [laughs]

1434
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,211
[Randy] We did it, guys.
We found the treasure.

1435
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:23,879
[Sammy laughs]

1436
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,964
Wait, these skulls,
they look like a--

1437
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,132
[Sammy gasps]

1438
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:31,428
-…warning.
-[loud groaning]

1439
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,305
Oh, come on!

1440
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:35,099
[whimpering]

1441
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,017
[chirping]

1442
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,690
[all screaming]

1443
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:48,278
[gasps] Spears!

1444
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,530
[breathes deeply]

1445
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,658
Okay! Okay, I know
what we have to do.

1446
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,536
When we get to the bottom of the hallway,
we have to jump at the same time.

1447
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,455
-It's too far!
-What? We will never make it!

1448
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,374
No, it's an illusion, okay? Trust me.

1449
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:04,169
-[breathes heavily]
-It's okay, Sammy. Just let go. It's okay.

1450
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:06,672
Okay.

1451
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,842
Three, two, one. Go!

1452
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,593
[all screaming]

1453
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:16,181
Now! Jump!

1454
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:19,017
[screaming]

1455
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,980
[all panting]

1456
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:30,696
It was a forced perspective.
A trick to fool thieves and trespassers!

1457
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:34,032
-Good job, Diego.
-Ancient Inca group hug for the win, guys.

1458
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,742
[laughter]

1459
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,754
[Randy] The monkey looked a lot more
impressive back there.

1460
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:49,506
Looks pretty impressive to me.

1461
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,635
-Is that an emerald?
-[Sammy] It's bigger than a basketball!

1462
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,554
I think we found the treasure, guys.

1463
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:57,473
No.

1464
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,350
This is the last puzzle.

1465
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,060
Look.

1466
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:04,188
This is a quipu.

1467
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,149
Inca written language.

1468
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:11,361
"Make an offering to the Gods…

1469
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,532
of that which is most revered."

1470
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,868
What did the Inca revere the most?

1471
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,037
[Alejandro] That's easy!

1472
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:24,666
The same as me.

1473
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,252
Gold.

1474
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,004
Oh, crud.

1475
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,548
Thanks for getting through
the tough stuff for me.

1476
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:35,594
Once again, I only had
to follow Miss Know-It-All,

1477
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:39,223
and she led me straight to the gold.
[laughs]

1478
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:46,021
Gold. Gold! [laughs]

1479
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:49,191
Lots and lots of gold!

1480
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,444
The answer to the puzzle is obvious.

1481
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,365
The Incas built monuments
to their gods with it.

1482
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:01,787
Gold is as close to touching the sun
as the Incas could get.

1483
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:04,831
[clicks tongue, laughs]

1484
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,630
[exhales]

1485
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,313
[treasure clattering]

1486
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:34,152
It's happening! [laughs]
It's happening!

1487
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,947
It's happening! [laughs]

1488
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:39,241
I beat you! I won!

1489
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:43,662
I beat you, I won!
I beat you, I won! Ha!

1490
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,081
The treasure is going to be mine!

1491
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,000
You were wrong about me, Alejandro.

1492
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,294
I'm not a know-it-all.

1493
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:52,713
But by now, I do know you.

1494
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,549
I knew that you would follow us in here.

1495
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,677
And I knew that you would let us
take all the risk for you.

1496
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,305
I knew the final Inca test would carry

1497
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,473
dire consequences for those
who should fail it.

1498
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:08,270
Which is why we are over here, and you…

1499
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:12,190
Well, you're standing right there.

1500
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,484
[clattering]

1501
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,654
Ah! Ah! [screaming]

1502
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:23,535
[screams]

1503
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:28,498
Oh!

1504
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,421
[Alejandro] I'm still alive!

1505
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,673
[radio chirps] Powell! Viper!

1506
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,134
Help me! Get in here! Now!

1507
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,678
My mercenaries are on their way.

1508
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,972
This isn't over yet!

1509
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:45,766
[rumbling]

1510
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,746
-Dora!
-Oh, honey!

1511
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,249
-Mami! Papi! I'm so sorry.
-[grunting]

1512
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,418
It's fine. How cool is this?

1513
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,253
Look at these guys,
that's a real crossbow.

1514
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,172
Honey. That's a real crossbow, yep.

1515
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,591
It's the Lost Guardians of Parapata.

1516
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:23,720
Ridiculous! There are no lost guardians.
I made them up.

1517
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,931
No, they're super real, bro.

1518
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,238
[gasps]

1519
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,244
[speaking Quechua]

1520
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:50,789
[speaking Quechua]

1521
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:53,750
I think this is when we perish.

1522
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,711
[speaking Quechua]

1523
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,840
-[speaking Quechua]
-Dora!

1524
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,803

01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:25,907
[speaking Quechua]

1527
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:39,838
-Be strong, honey, okay?
-You choose the right thing.

1528
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,715
-[shushes]
-Yep.

1529
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:49,699
[rumbling]

1530
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:06,091
-[both sigh]
-She did it.

1531
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,472
[speaking Quechua]

1532
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:19,396
-Thank you. Yeah.
-Thank you.

1533
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,026
Honey.

1534
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,364
[gasps] It's like nothing I've…

1535
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:32,033
-ever imagined.
-Ever imagined.

1536
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,165
It's breathtaking.

1537
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,337
Monkey.

1538
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:49,551
Really big gold monkey. [laughs]

1539
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:53,471
-[rumbling]
-[Boots gasps]

1540
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,181
[Swiper]
Say goodbye to your little friend.

1541
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:56,474
What is happening?

1542
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,977
-Swiper!
-Adiós, losers!

1543
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,354
[speaking Quechua]

1544
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,023
Everyone get out of here!

1545
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:06,234
-What about the gold?
-It doesn't matter!

1546
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:07,903
Wait, guys! What about me?

1547
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,446
You can't leave me here!

1548
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:11,656
Dora! Randy! Help me!

1549
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,825
We're a team! Guys!

1550
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,704
[Sammy]
Dora, come on!

1551
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:24,794
