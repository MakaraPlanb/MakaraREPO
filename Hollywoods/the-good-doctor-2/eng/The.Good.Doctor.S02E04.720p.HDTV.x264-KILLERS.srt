101
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,136
we have to deal with.
Kitty has cervical fractures.

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,037
She broke her neck.

103
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,040
Luckily, we can repair it
by fusing her spine.

104
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:16,243
Your range of motion will be restricted,

105
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,811

106

108

Not at that level,
and certainly not free solo.

Then I think you'll prefer
the second option...

111
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,543
The Odontoid Screw Procedure.

112
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,132
It doesn't involve vertebral fusion

113
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:41,434
and could maintain
your full range of motion.

114
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,403
Seriously? Sign me up!

115
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:46,740
The spinal fusion surgery
is generally preferred

116
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,508
because it has higher healing rates

117
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:50,544
and more favorable long-term results.

118
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:52,379
But the screw procedure's less invasive,

119
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:54,014
so there's reduced collateral injury

120
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,398
and no permanent damage.

121
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,152

122
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:00,554

femur and a ruptured spleen,

then a skull fracture

Okay, when I climb,
adrenaline is the enemy.

00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:34,999

Mr. and Mrs. Kwon, I
understand how you're feeling,

was tell her the truth,

That's what we tell ourselves

and not worry about whether
we're helping or hurting.

242

Kitty believe the surgery

17 and a helpless child?
