That makes no sense.

4
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:14,370
I rented that apartment,

You don't want us to be a couple?

Neither.

17

If we get an apartment together,

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,580
I feel like that's a signal

19
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:01,350
that you and I might end up
as boyfriend and girlfriend,

20
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,686
and that's not going to happen.

21
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,288
You can't predict the future.

Feelings change.

23
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:10,459

sometimes I don't.

25
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,596
But I don't want my feelings to change.

26
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:15,331
I like being your friend,

27
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,334
and romantic relationships
a-are unpredictable.

28
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,237
So much can go wrong,
especially when I am involved.

29
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,039
And if we live together,
it's gonna be awkward.

30

You're bound to walk in on me
when I'm naked

31
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:27,810

Yes.

many of them minor.

Emphysematous cystitis is
a treatable bladder infection.

86

Your symptoms could also
be from a kidney stone

87
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:02,531
or dehydration.

88
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,767
Could my issues be caused by...

89
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,635
gastric bypass surgery?

90
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:08,237
It depends. When was it?

91
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,905
15 years ago.

92
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:12,241
I used to be 377 pounds.

93
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,442
That's a lot.

94
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,478
Your surgery wouldn't cause
those symptoms,

95
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,282
but we need to do a cystoscopy
to find out what did.

96
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:22,751
I'll cancel the ortho
and get Lim to sign off.

Hey, wait. What,

00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:27,423
So, what is a cystoscopy?

99
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:30,826
It's like a knee scope,

100
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:33,423
except the camera goes up your penis.

101
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,667
You administered amiodarone?

102
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,222

104

It's better than when you came in.

105
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:46,942
Your heart is failing

106
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:50,312
as a result of a condition
called mitral regurgitation.

107
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:52,548
One of your valves
isn't closing all the way.

108
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,150
Blood keeps leaking back
into your atrium.

109
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:56,352
That's why you fainted

110
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:58,120
and why we need
to repair that valve ASAP.

111
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,891
How long have you been anorexic?

112
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:08,397

Mitral valve issues

Your first defecation event

But you canceled physical
therapy this morning.

Those nurses have big mouths.

148
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,657
I canceled because
my leg is a little sore.

149
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,859
That could be phlebitis

151
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:47,329

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,333
Every day in the hospital

154
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:55,904
increases your risk

155
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:58,777
You need to move your bowels,
and we should walk right now.

156
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:02,544
I'll go very slow.

157

00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:06,451
that you are needed elsewhere right now?

159
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:10,052

Contrast cystogram.

169
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:36,111
Thread the catheter
further into the bladder.

That's a big drop. Good for him.

That makes it less impressive?

173
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,219
- Now infuse the contrast.
- Well, yeah,

174
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:47,189
it is the easy way, compared
to just diet and exercise.

175
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:49,925
The contrast dye is dissipating.

176

his bladder to his intestine.

403
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,686
Anything less than 1,200 calories a day,

404
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:26,122

wouldn't be improving.

405
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:28,149
In fact, she'll keep losing weight.

that valve repair now.

You want to use brain surgery
for a psychiatric disorder?

412
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:51,747
Surgical procedures have been effective

413
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:55,017
for, uh, depression, OCD, addiction.

414
00:18:57,488 --> 00:19:00,556
This surgery could reduce
her anxiety around eating.

415
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:02,525
Once she's eating, her
malnutrition will improve

416
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,427
and reduce the risk of the valve repair.

417
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:06,829
It could also cause personality changes.

418
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:10,900
And this study covers six subjects

419
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:12,802
with only 50% success.

420
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:14,704
Well, this could be Louisa's only shot

421

at getting free of this illness.

422
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:18,341
And it was done in the UK.

423
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,943
DBS isn't FDA-approved
for anorexia treatment here.

424
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:23,145

425

00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:12,096
Well, this doctor felt strongly
that you should see

how he responds to medication before,

467
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:15,432
Wade's care is completely
appropriate for his condition.

468
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:17,067
But if his Crohn's lesions
could be treated

469
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,836
