Shaun?

668
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:52,688
I meant what I said to Andrews.

669
00:35:56,293 --> 00:35:59,395
He might never fully appreciate
what you accomplished out there.

670
00:36:01,031 --> 00:36:02,442
But I did.

Yeah.

00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:50,172
I said goodbye to Jared.

678

He has to go to Denver,

679

and I have to stay here with you.

No you don't, Shaun.

681

It's not up to Jared, it's not up to me,

682
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:07,756
it's not to anyone
to tell you where to be.

I've got to take it alone.

No.

It's hard saying goodbye.

700
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:38,419
Doesn't mean it's a mistake.

701
00:40:41,277 --> 00:40:43,846
- Yeah.
- I think you'll be okay.
