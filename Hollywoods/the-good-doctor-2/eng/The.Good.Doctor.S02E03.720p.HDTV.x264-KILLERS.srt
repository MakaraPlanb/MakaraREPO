I've also thought about it.

188
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,003
In fact, when the new ACGME
guidelines were released,

189
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:33,106
I joined a nationwide study
analyzing a flextime schedule.

190
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,876
It found that as long as a weekly
max of 80 hours is adhered to,

191
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,813
patient outcomes and resident
satisfaction scores are better

192
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:42,549
than at hospitals with
a daily max.

193
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:44,751

have to agree to disagree

new policies "make any sense."

the lead?

334
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:40,088
No. I just find it interesting

opportunity after she apologized.

336

No. I'll stay.

everyone but J.L., Dr. Browne,

Winter's procedure requires
an extra-large-gauge needle

512

521

True.

But I know that she's not
in middle school,

525
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:51,114

thought of you as a man,

526
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:53,911

for just one innocent peck.

What's going on? I thought I couldn't
be released until I was arraigned.

531
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:47,070
The judge decided nine hours
was enough punishment.

532

She's the one who should be punished.
I should sue her.

It's a polyploid mass.

648
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,385
It extends from the uterine
to the ovarian artery.

649

All collateral blood supplies
have been invaded.

650

We're gonna have to do
a full hysterectomy.

651
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:54,629
What if we resect the mass

652
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:56,831
and graft a saphenous vein
for bypass?

653
00:31:56,855 --> 00:31:59,943

is too high. She'd go septic.
