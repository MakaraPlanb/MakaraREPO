Good work.

an incorrect response.

00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,651
Hmm.

712
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,853
Have a good evening.
You've earned it.

713
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,560
I don't want to go on walks.

Dr. Han, you need to make me
a surgical resident again.

I appreciate
you telling me that.

720

I was wondering whether you had it
in you to advocate for yourself.

721
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:06,237
But the truth is, Shaun,

722
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,005
what you did today,

723
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,441
it proved I'm right.

724
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:14,044
Your skills are tremendous.

726
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,052
You could be
a great pathologist.

727

the Sadies out there,

Your spine is stable.

There may still be some residual

No, I...
