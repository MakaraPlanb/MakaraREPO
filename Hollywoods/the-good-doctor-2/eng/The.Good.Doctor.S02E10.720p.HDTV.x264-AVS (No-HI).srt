1
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:17,436
This is Andrews' fault.

2
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:19,304
Agreed.

3
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:22,007
The bourbon may also bear
some responsibility.

4
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,308
Agreed.

5
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:26,311
You said "fault."

6
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:30,749
You don't regret that we...
No, not at all.

7
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:32,951
Seriously.

8
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:35,554
It was...

9
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:36,755
Pretty great.

10
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,024
Yeah.

11
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:41,360
And definitely shouldn't
happen again.

12
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:44,763
No, it shouldn't.

13
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,665
It'd make things
too complicated at work.

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,469
Let's chalk it up to, uh,

15
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:53,472
"Andrews screwed us, so we
screwed each other" impulse.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,677
I gotta get going.

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,145
I'm covering
the E.R. today.

18
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,315
Ooh, right before Christmas?

19
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:05,450
Gonna be a madhouse.

20
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:07,652
Yeah.

21
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,590
What is that noise?

22
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:48,493
"Jingle Bells"?

23
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:50,195
Two ambulances coming in,
back-to-back.

24
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:54,366
Hey. I need you on
your game today, Murphy.

25
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,434
Okay.

26
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,245
Uh, male, mid-30s,

27
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:07,512
found unresponsive in Arrivals.

28
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:09,448
Restarted his heart
on site. Low O2,

29
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:11,583
wheezing, significant airway
resistance to the bag mask...

30
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:13,718
We need more hands on deck.
STAT. I've been calling,

31
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:15,053
everyone's left town
for the holidays.

32
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:16,288
Reznick's around.

33
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,556
Weird you know that,
but glad you do.

34
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:18,757
Get Reznick in here.
On it.

35
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,892
Take him to Bay 4.
Murphy, I need you with me.

36
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:23,428
What do we got?

37
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:25,697
This is Marianne Southam, she
collapsed in Baggage Claim.

38
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,098
Both patients came
from the airport?

39
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:28,600
It's that time of year.
Everyone's traveling.

40
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:30,435
Right leg is red and swollen.

41
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:32,103
She's complaining of chest
pains, shortness of breath,

42
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:33,438
and she has a low-grade fever.

43
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,374
Did you just get
off a long flight?

44
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:37,309
20 hours, from Malaysia.

45
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:40,279
Deep vein thrombosis formed
while she was seated,

46
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:42,080
that explains the red leg
and the fever.

47
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:44,015
Part of the clot broke off,
traveled to her lung,

48
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:46,885
that explains the chest pain.
Pulmonary embolism.

49
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,153
We lost his pulse again!

50
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,089
Take Marianne to Bay 5.

51
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:53,192
I'll talk you through managing
a pulmonary embolism.

52
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:55,327
I'm gonna light him up.

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,628
Clear.

54
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,301
Got a rhythm.
Barely.

55
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:03,602
He can't live
on 30 beats a minute.

56
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:05,570
His lungs are too stiff
to pre-oxygenate.

57
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:07,706
Fiberoptic blade
and a 7.5 ET tube.

58
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:13,278
Murphy, anti-coagulate her with
a 5,000-unit heparin bolus.

59
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,920
Set the ventilator
to assist control.

60
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,293
Heparin bolus infused.
Fever's spiking at 103.5.

61
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:30,295
Could be ARDS
from a viral pneumonia.

62
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,963
Get a chest X-ray.

63
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:34,098
Lost him again.

64
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:38,303
O2 SAT is 92.

65
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:39,971
Your chest pain
should be getting better.

66
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:41,640
It is.
Thank you.

67
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:43,074
Peak airway pressure's 50.

68
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:45,644
Switch the ventilator to PRVC.

69
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:47,078
Pushing I.V. epinephrine.

70
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,515
Now you need to insert a central
line in case we go to thrombolysis.

71
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,194
I need you, Murphy.

72
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:07,466
Still V. Fib.

73
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:08,867
Push 300 of amiodarone.

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,476
Asystole.
He's still not responding.

75
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,712
That's over 30 minutes
of brain and cardiac hypoxia.

76
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:26,217
Stop compressions.

77
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:31,089
Time of death, 10:07.

78
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,764
Have you had contact
with this man?

79
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,602
He was on my flight
from Malaysia.

80
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:47,939
They both have vesicular
rashes on their necks.

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,510
Whatever infection killed him,
she may have it, too.

82
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,250
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>
== <font color="#138CE9">https://</font>subscene<font color="#138CE9">.com</font> ==

83
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:12,331
This is a negative
pressure room,

84
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:13,932
designed so no air flows out.

85
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,867
Keeps germs from spreading.

86
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,502
Because whatever I have
is gonna kill me,

87
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:18,803
just like the man
from the plane?

88
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:21,072
Your symptoms are not
as severe as his.

89
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,242
Although, yours
will probably get worse

90
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,645
as the virus progresses.

91
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:29,280
We don't know for sure whether
you have the same thing.

92
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:32,884
We know nothing about him,
his condition, or his history.

93
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,386
When did you start feeling sick?

94
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:35,820
On the plane.

95
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:39,891
I've never even been
outside the U.S. before.

96
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:42,427
My ex-husband hated
to travel and...

97
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:49,167
Was the man who died
sitting near you?

98
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:53,104
No, he was six or seven rows
in front of me.

99
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,376
Were you ever physically
close to him?

100
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:00,379
Say, waiting for the restroom
or in line to board?

101
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:02,981
No, I think he slept
almost the entire flight.

102
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:07,051
That suggests the virus can
be transmitted in the air.

103
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:09,921
Which means everyone
in the plane

104
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,391
and this emergency room
has been exposed.

105
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:18,663
We'll start conditioning
tomorrow,

106
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:20,264
so we use chemo and
total body irradiation to...

107
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:23,034
To wipe out my crappy
leukemia-producing bone marrow

108
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:25,804
so you can replace it with
some good stuff. Well said.

109
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:28,640
Looks like your dad's good
to go on his marrow donation.

110
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:29,674
Please don't call him that.

111
00:06:31,443 --> 00:06:34,413
Bob Cravens walked out on me
and my mom when I was four.

112
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:36,948
His biological material
gave me life,

113
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,282
and apparently
he's gonna save me,

114
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:39,350
but he's not my dad.

115
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,388
Any unusual complaints or pain
we should know about?

116
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:45,890
I've been tired.

117
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:47,626
And the last day, achy,

118
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:50,361
kind of stiff...
Standard leukemia woes.

119
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,064
Anywhere in particular?

120
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,535
My neck, left arm.

121
00:06:56,568 --> 00:06:58,737
Right, Chris, you're
having a heart attack.

122
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:01,873
N-No.
My chest feels fine.

123
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,374
We need to get you up
to radiation right away.

124
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:05,043
Call and let them know
we're coming.

125
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:06,811
Get his donor in here.

126
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,547
How is radiation gonna help
a heart attack?

127
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,616
Your blockage is most likely
excess blast white cells.

128
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,051
The best way
to clear out your heart

129
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,085
is to treat your leukemia.

130
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:17,889
It's what we planned.
Just a day early.

131
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,562
It might not be airborne.

132
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:25,263
Maybe both passengers
were already infected

133
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:26,698
when they got on the plane.

134
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:28,833
Marianne said she felt fine
before the flight.

135
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:30,869
But even if she did
contract it on the plane,

136
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:32,403
it could've been
through a shared water cup

137
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:33,505
or napkin...

138
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,406
Which would make
a quarantine unnecessary.

139
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,378
I'll call the Public
Health Department, the CDC,

140
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:41,813
they may want
to track the passengers

141
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:43,381
and anyone they
came into contact with.

142
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:46,117
Keep me up to date.
Okay.

143
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,721
Hey. I'm done.

144
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:52,023
Jill, are you still on?

145
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,559
Get me the CDC and a change of clothes.

146
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:56,495
I'm coming in.

147
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:58,229
Thanks for
getting me called in, Tyler.

148
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:00,298
You're welcome.
That was sarcasm.

149
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,266
Oh, was it?
If this turns into a crisis,

150
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,702
where else would you want to be?

151
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,771
I hear you're having
some stomach pain?

152
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:08,072
It hurts a lot.

153
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:10,875
I figured it was probably the candy
canes, but I took some Pepto.

154
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:11,976
Didn't help at all.

155
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,512
How many candy canes we talking?

156
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:15,146
Three or four... Dozen.

157
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,915
Of the little ones.

158
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:18,382
They pass them out
at the mall where I work.

159
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,318
I like to munch on them.
Keeps me in character.

160
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:22,120
Sounds like you might
be overdoing it.

161
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,588
Take off your shirt.

162
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,725
How did you know I was still in town?

163
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:32,096
Because the holidays are
"an obligatory performance

164
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,565
"where families buy each other gifts

165
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:34,899
and pretend everything is perfect."

166
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,868
Which is why you tell yours
you have to work every year

167
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:38,570
even when you don't.

168
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,106
He's a good listener.

169
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:45,276
What's that scar from?

170
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:47,779
Rudolph is an ass.

171
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,582
It's a minor bowel resection

172
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,817
for diverticulitis
eight months ago.

173
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,753
Oh, we need to do a contrast CT.

174
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:57,956
You need to come with me.

175
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:01,626
Dr. Lim,
he has it, too.

176
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,027
There, on his neck.
A rash.

177
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,128
It wasn't there earlier.

178
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,734
It hasn't fully developed, but
it could be the same thing.

179
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:11,435
It can't be.
I had on a mask, gloves...

180
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,972
Did you keep on the mask
the whole time?

181
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:16,274
Not... With airborne diseases,
that's important...

182
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,177
It's Marianne.
Her O2 SATs are crashing.

183
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,879
Get another dose of
I.V. methylprednisolone.

184
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:25,449
We need to move up
the transplant.

185
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,018
No, it doesn't change anything.

186
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:30,689
You'll be anesthetized,
you won't feel a thing

187
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:32,356
and when you wake up,

188
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,893
your son will be on his
way to being healthy.

189
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,166
We'll see you soon.

190
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:47,005
Sorry I couldn't meet you
at the airport.

191
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,407
That's a cool t-shirt.

192
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,475
It probably freaks
you out, right?

193
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:55,013
Like, "is he gonna
gender-transition or something?"

194
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:57,015
No, if that's your thing,
I'm cool.

195
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:01,185
How long am I stuck here?

196
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:02,553
Just for the rest of this shift.

197
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:04,222
And then I'm out of here
for three days.

198
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:06,190
There's a new rock-climbing
gym we can check out,

199
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:07,558
and the batting cages.

200
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:09,961
I'm good.

201
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:12,063
I got a season of
"Rick and Morty" on my phone.

202
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:18,970
Clear.

203
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:29,480
That's six rounds of defib.
And 30 minutes of CPR.

204
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:33,384
Okay, Dr. Murphy,
you can stop.

205
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:48,701
I just spoke
with Dr. Andrews.

206
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:51,236
We're on soft quarantine
while he consults the Board.

207
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,239
Call dispatch, put all
ambulances on diversion.

208
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:55,941
Do your best to stop
all walk-ins.

209
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:58,878
Say we're at capacity
and send them to County.

210
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,079
Stall all discharges.

211
00:11:00,112 --> 00:11:02,748
Tyler stays in isolation
and on antivirals.

212
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:05,317
Fever is likely the next
stage, so keep a close eye.

213
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,618
What else are we dealing with?

214
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:09,021
I always have lunch
by 2:00.

215
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:11,757
It's 2:15.
I need to eat.

216
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,659
I've got a banana in my bag
if you want it.

217
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:14,894
A banana isn't lunch.

218
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:16,662
A turkey sandwich and milk
is lunch.

219
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:18,463
Dr. Murphy,
patients first,

220
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,099
then we'll work
on that sandwich.

221
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:22,134
What else? 60-year-old
woman with angina,

222
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,468
visiting her family
for the holidays.

223
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:25,570
Forgot her blood pressure meds.
Came in for a prescription.

224
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:28,507
Her refill just got delayed.
What else?

225
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,776
The crib was almost finished
when the screwdriver slipped.

226
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,945
My family doctor's closed
for the holidays.

227
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:34,780
They would've sent you
here anyway.

228
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:37,249
This type of injury can
cause permanent damage.

229
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:40,485
Makes me feel less guilty for
bringing my baby into a germ pit.

230
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:43,488
No offense.

231
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:46,558
Guessing this is your first?

232
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:50,062
My husband and I
waited a long time.

233
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:52,064
I want everything to be perfect.

234
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:55,100
Which, as my husband
reminds me, is impossible.

235
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:58,370
Yet, my birth plan is five pages long.

236
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:01,506
All closed up.

237
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,875
So I can go home?

238
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:06,111
Not before we do a nerve study.

239
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,013
I would hate for you to lose
feeling in your fingers.

240
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:11,450
You can't leave.

241
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,485
I'm sorry.
What? Hospital policy.

242
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:15,320
Look, I'm...
I'm not a patient.

243
00:12:15,354 --> 00:12:17,556
All right, I just came down here to
get some chips. My dad's a doctor.

244
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,291
Who's your dad?
Dr. Alex Park.

245
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,293
Can you call him?

246
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:23,528
My phone's charging upstairs.

247
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:25,731
I'll call him, so he knows where
to come find you when he's free.

248
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,166
But for now,
you've got to stay put.

249
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:31,136
Why? Because I'm older than you.

250
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:41,546
Find the employee contact
list, call Park.

251
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,849
He should know where his son is.
Sure.

252
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:52,724
I feel so much worse than
when I was having a heart attack.

253
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:53,893
I don't doubt it.

254
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:55,828
Because of the urgency
of your situation,

255
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:59,531
we used combined leukapheresis,
chemo, and radiation.

256
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:01,400
You're no longer at risk for
another heart attack or stroke.

257
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:04,069
And I also no longer
have an immune system.

258
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:08,707
My donor's on his way, right?

259
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,342
I spoke with him. He said
he was getting in his car.

260
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:12,577
When was that?

261
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:14,980
I'll follow up.

262
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:24,890
He's still finding
new ways to let me down.

263
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:31,330
I thought you guys
were gonna do a C.T.

264
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:33,933
We're doing a KUB X-ray instead.

265
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:35,200
It's almost as good.

266
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,803
Why would you go with "almost"?

267
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:56,421
Can you hear that?

268
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,793
Hear what?
Excuse me.

269
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:03,128
I'm looking for a patient.

270
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:04,263
You'll need to speak
with a nurse.

271
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:05,931
I've been waiting
to speak to a nurse.

272
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:08,400
You must hear that.
The light is buzzing.

273
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:09,801
I don't hear anything.
It's loud

274
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:11,236
and very distracting.

275
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,438
It needs to be fixed.

276
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,250
You like Italian?

277
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:27,519
La Nostra?

278
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,588
It's great.

279
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:32,291
Barbecue? Ethiopian?

280
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:33,692
What are you talking about?

281
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:38,130
Where we're going on our date.

282
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:41,166
You haven't asked me on one,
and I haven't said yes.

283
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:45,437
Who turns down the request
of a man trapped in isolation?

284
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,642
What about sushi?
Everybody likes it.

285
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:53,812
Also, I'm pretty good
with chopsticks.

286
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:56,181
Never hurts to display
a little manual dexterity.

287
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:57,917
You know, tends to impress.

288
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:03,122
I will want a cocktail to soothe
my nerves, but...

289
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:04,890
Why would you be nervous?

290
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,859
Have you seen you?

291
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:12,064
You are smart
as well as beautiful,

292
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:16,635
and I will need all the tools in
my toolkit to dazzle you, so...

293
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,671
No drink for me.

294
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,643
Have one after the appetizers.

295
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:27,112
I'll be impressed by then.

296
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:36,788
You have a fever.

297
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:42,761
He has a fever, and the rash
is fully materialized.

298
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:44,829
Okay.

299
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:48,567
Here we go.

300
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,103
Quarantine has been approved.

301
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:52,671
Yeah.

302
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,482
Can I have everyone's attention?

303
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:10,122
This emergency room and everyone
in it is now under quarantine.

304
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:13,959
We're hoping none of you
have been exposed,

305
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:15,660
but a serious respiratory virus

306
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:17,062
has infected three patients.

307
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:19,398
What?
This can't happen.

308
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:21,766
We're starting everyone on
antivirals just as a precaution.

309
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,136
We'll also be bringing in
food and water,

310
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:27,539
so if any of you have any dietary
restrictions, please let us know now.

311
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:29,574
You can't make us stay here.
That's right.

312
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:32,377
I-I can't... Especially not
if someone's seriously ill.

313
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:34,046
We are legally entitled to
keep you for...

314
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,314
They locked us in.

315
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:39,251
Are we locked in?
Oh, no way.

316
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:43,022
I gotta get out.
Sir.

317
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,160
Sorry.

318
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:58,537
Like it or not,
no one's leaving.

319
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,928
The decision to implement
the quarantine

320
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:25,965
was made after consultation
with the Board.

321
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:28,334
The CDC has been kept
fully informed,

322
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,670
and we will be proceeding in
accordance with all protocol...

323
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:34,674
Shaun, Morgan, and Lim
are in there.

324
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:36,309
And our patient is out here.

325
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:38,978
There's still no sign of the
donor. He's not answering my calls.

326
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:41,647
I asked my contact at San Jose
PD to do a home check-in.

327
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:47,353
Park.

328
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:49,789
He's down there?

329
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:51,157
How... Yeah,
put him on.

330
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:53,126
It's Security... Kellan's
stuck in the quarantine.

331
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:57,463
I'll pass along anything
I hear from San Jose PD.

332
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,405
Tyler started coughing.

333
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:08,007
Let's up his antivirals. Start
high flow oxygen and zosyn

334
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,942
to counter
any underlying infection.

335
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:12,345
Santa Pete has
a sigmoid volvulus,

336
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:13,846
he needs surgery very soon.

337
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:17,383
My call ended 37 minutes ago.

338
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,552
I'm supposed to be somewhere
else, It's important.

339
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:20,820
No, it's not.

340
00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:25,024
We need a non-surgical fix
to a bowel obstruction.

341
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:27,160
Anyone?

342
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,751
Murphy.

343
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,754
Mmm.
You got something?

344
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:58,124
Not really.

345
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:00,860
Anything at all.
Please.

346
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:06,065
We...

347
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:07,967
We usually...

348
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:10,102
We...

349
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:14,207
We usually make a hole and...

350
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:18,611
And come at an obstruction
from the side,

351
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,246
but we can't.

352
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,982
We need to use
the existing holes.

353
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:27,320
An endoscope risks tearing
right through the bowel.

354
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:28,988
A saline enema doesn't.

355
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:31,624
And it might untwist the bowel.

356
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:35,528
Simple, but it could work.

357
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:37,062
Nice.

358
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,934
I'm fine.

359
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,304
Do you have your inhaler?
Of course I do.

360
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:47,740
What were you doing down here?

361
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:49,275
This isn't my fault.

362
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:53,213
If you hadn't been working...
Kellan.

363
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:55,080
I know you must be scared.

364
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:56,982
I'm fine.

365
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:05,958
I'm keeping this hat on
for luck.

366
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,160
Here we go.

367
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:11,531
I'm threading the tube
into the rectum.

368
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:13,933
Now, slowly push the saline.

369
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:15,134
That's...

370
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,136
It's not a pleasant experience.

371
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:19,171
I'm getting some
resistance to flow.

372
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:20,840
I must've reached
the obstruction.

373
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:22,174
Push harder.
Hang in there, Pete.

374
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,276
Call me Santa...

375
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,777
Ahhh!

376
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,479
Keep pushing the saline.

377
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:27,913
I'm sorry, Santa.

378
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:42,161
I feel so much better.

379
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:49,335
We've got you on a
pretty high dose of antivirals.

380
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:53,573
So, what's next?

381
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:55,107
We're debating nitric oxide...

382
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,143
No, I mean if
this doesn't turn around.

383
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:01,947
What happens to me next?

384
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:04,317
ARDS.

385
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:06,786
Then full respiratory failure.

386
00:21:11,491 --> 00:21:13,926
Hey, I've got a new idea
for our first date.

387
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:16,529
Archery.

388
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:18,598
I used to compete
when I was young.

389
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:22,001
Basically, you'd be showing off.

390
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:25,505
I can show you some tricks.

391
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:27,907
Teach you a spit-finger hook,
how to anchor...

392
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,610
And then proceed
to demolish you.

393
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:33,579
Well, that sounds like a reason to live.

394
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:58,971
I'm here to take you
to your imaging appointment.

395
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:00,406
Where's Shaun?

396
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,042
Shaun is quarantined in the E.R.

397
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:05,611
Quarantined? What, what...
What quarantine?

398
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:09,582
Apparently for some highly
contagious, deadly virus.

399
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:11,617
But Shaun sounds fine.

400
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:13,519
Except for some buzzing light

401
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:14,820
and his concern about lunch

402
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:18,524
and you missing your appointment
at the imaging clinic, so...

403
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,361
Let's go. Take me
to the hospital.

404
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,363
We are going to your
appointment and making sure

405
00:22:23,396 --> 00:22:25,297
your think-melon
remains tumor-free.

406
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:27,066
Take me to the hospital please.

407
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,068
I'd like to help.
How?

408
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:31,070
By taking your old job back
and saving the day?

409
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:33,939
Putting on an "Outbreak" suit
and rescuing Shaun?

410
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:40,212
Some people may find
your sassy attitude appealing.

411
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:41,647
I'm not one of them.

412
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:43,683
And I am crushed.

413
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,462
Sir, I'm sorry.
You can't...

414
00:22:56,496 --> 00:22:58,464
My wife's in there.

415
00:22:58,498 --> 00:23:00,466
Viola! Look, that's her.
I need to get in there.

416
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,268
They're setting up a room
inside for friends and family.

417
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:04,670
Clifton, what are you doing?

418
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,407
Look, I'm coming in. Stop...
Let go of me!

419
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,241
Calm down
or you're gonna get hurt.

420
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:11,276
Stop.
This is all my fault.

421
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,012
No. If I'd put the crib
together like you asked...

422
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:15,347
Forget about the crib.

423
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:16,982
I need you to take care
of yourself.

424
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,819
Because if something
happens to me...

425
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:24,557
our son needs someone
to take care of him.

426
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:33,365
It's... It's a boy?

427
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:35,701
I'm sorry I'm ruining
your surprise.

428
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:37,036
No.

429
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,144
Baby, I love you so much.

430
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:46,612
I love you, too.

431
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,187
I love you.

432
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:34,727
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

433
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:37,196
Shaun?

434
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:39,264
Why are you answering
our donor's phone?

435
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:43,268
Because he's here in quarantine.

436
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:14,768
What happened to the CDC
getting a team here today?

437
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:17,771
They confirmed that it
started in Malaysia last week.

438
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:19,339
Between the virologists
already there

439
00:25:19,372 --> 00:25:21,908
and the ones grounded on the East
Coast because of the snowstorm...

440
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,309
Stay on them.

441
00:25:29,282 --> 00:25:30,951
What do we know about the virus?

442
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:34,120
Similar symptoms to SARS,
but much faster moving.

443
00:25:34,154 --> 00:25:35,789
Is Bob Cravens infected?

444
00:25:35,822 --> 00:25:37,090
Not so far.

445
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:39,926
Currently Tyler Durnes, the EMT,

446
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,563
is the only person
displaying symptoms.

447
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:44,430
I need his bone marrow.
I'd like to go in and get it.

448
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:45,732
I'll comply with all protocol.

449
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:48,334
You're not hot zone certified.
None of us are.

450
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:50,971
My leukemia patient
has no immune system.

451
00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:52,673
He'll die soon without
a marrow transplant.

452
00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:54,608
Well, then you best find him
another donor

453
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:57,644
because no one, or their bone
marrow, is leaving that quarantine.

454
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:02,616
Have you heard from County about
taking our PICU transfers?

455
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,575
H-How are my O2 SATs?

456
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,511
Holding steady.

457
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:35,415
Do you want to call anyone?

458
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:38,685
Uh, I, uh...

459
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:42,555
I... I thought about
letting my mom know...

460
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:44,424
what was going on, but...

461
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:48,929
She'd just worry about me
and feel bad she's not here.

462
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:50,997
So...

463
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:54,768
She... She knows I love her.

464
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:02,375
How's it going in here?

465
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:03,844
Dr. Reznick was just telling me

466
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:06,112
about some college lesbian experiences...

467
00:27:07,748 --> 00:27:10,216
Was that just my imagination?

468
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,619
Actually, we were talking
about your mother.

469
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:14,520
Interesting.

470
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:21,394
I don't like the drop
in his O2 SATs.

471
00:27:22,195 --> 00:27:23,764
Let's start him on nitric oxide.

472
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:28,368
I knew you liked me.

473
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:40,446
He's in this hospital?

474
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:43,549
Bob actually came through for once.

475
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:46,753
Unfortunately, we can't
wait for him to get out of quarantine.

476
00:27:46,787 --> 00:27:49,089
But we found an alternative
donor in the Bay Area.

477
00:27:49,122 --> 00:27:50,757
How compatible are they?

478
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:53,459
They share five out of eight
of your markers.

479
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,562
Bob is a much better match.

480
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:58,799
I can't handle marrow rejection,

481
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:00,801
or having to repeat
this nightmare.

482
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:13,947
That's a symptom
of the MAC pneumonia.

483
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,949
The antibiotics aren't working.

484
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:20,253
You need bone marrow, or this
infection is going to kill you. Soon.

485
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:21,922
Days, not weeks.

486
00:28:29,495 --> 00:28:32,332
Seven years I've been
battling leukemia.

487
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,702
Been through four
full courses of chemo,

488
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:38,138
so many trips to the hospital
I've lost count.

489
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:40,807
Just knowing my father
showed up,

490
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:45,378
I'm grateful, relieved.

491
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:54,855
I'm okay if this is the end.

492
00:28:56,356 --> 00:28:57,858
I'd like to sign a DNR.

493
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:01,694
Chris, the CDC will be here
tomorrow.

494
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:04,297
If they can identify the
virus, we can test Bob.

495
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,567
If he's negative... Whatever you
can manage before my heart stops,

496
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,202
go for it.

497
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:14,975
Please get me the form.

498
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:29,189
His fever's climbing.

499
00:29:29,222 --> 00:29:30,757
Give the nebulizer time to work.

500
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,128
Cooling blankets,
that could help.

501
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:37,397
I'll go get some from
the supply closet.

502
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:40,600
Put your mask back on.

503
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,002
Why?

504
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:43,503
Because I'm infected.

505
00:29:58,986 --> 00:30:00,354
You got it, too?

506
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:08,062
You guys any closer
to figuring this thing out?

507
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:09,964
Afraid not.

508
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,368
On the bright side, I...

509
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:16,437
I think I'm growing on Morgan.

510
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,561
There's got to be a way.

511
00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:43,630
You can't go in.

512
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:46,133
Bob can't come out.
The marrow can't come out.

513
00:30:48,936 --> 00:30:50,571
What if it doesn't?

514
00:30:52,473 --> 00:30:54,909
What if the marrow never leaves?

515
00:30:54,942 --> 00:30:58,145
Are we suggesting we put a man with
no immune system into the quarantine?

516
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,647
We expand the quarantine,
create a section just for him.

517
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:05,552
One of the doctors inside could do
the extraction and the transplant.

518
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:07,254
And then one of two things happens.

519
00:31:07,288 --> 00:31:10,057
He stays in isolation till we
know he hasn't been infected.

520
00:31:10,892 --> 00:31:12,293
Or it kills him.

521
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:17,331
There's no way Andrews will
let us expand the quarantine.

522
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:21,602
Wish me luck.

523
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,143
Going to 360 Joules.
Clear.

524
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:41,255
We can crack his chest
and do cardiac massage.

525
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:42,957
Dr. Reznick.
Have Petringa bring in

526
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,525
the internal paddles
from the trauma bay...

527
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:46,027
Morgan.

528
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:15,022
Hey, Doogie.

529
00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:17,925
You didn't hear me
talking to you?

530
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:20,527
My sugar's crazy high. 650.

531
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:26,000
That doesn't make sense.

532
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:29,170
I gave you the proper
dosage of insulin.

533
00:32:29,203 --> 00:32:30,637
10 units.

534
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:31,939
10 units?

535
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:34,641
10 units doesn't even make
a dent with me.

536
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:36,877
You got a doctor around here
who knows what he's doing?

537
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,579
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

538
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:41,215
I'll give you another 10 units.

539
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:42,883
Waste of time.
Make it 20.

540
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:44,385
I'll give you 10.

541
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:46,387
What's wrong with you?
You sound like an idiot.

542
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,422
Don't be a jerk.
Mind your own business.

543
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:50,424
Doc. Doc, I don't
feel so...

544
00:32:50,457 --> 00:32:52,526
Ahhh!
What the hell?

545
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,095
Did he just infect me?

546
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:55,496
Possibly.

547
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:57,664
I need to examine your abdomen.

548
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:05,939
Your obstruction has returned.

549
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,242
You need surgery, now.

550
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:09,876
But we're stuck in here.

551
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:12,146
And there's no operating room.

552
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:16,050
We will have to improvise.

553
00:33:23,891 --> 00:33:25,427
There's no Neptune machine.

554
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,530
Without suction, the surgical
field will be filled with blood.

555
00:33:28,563 --> 00:33:32,234
We can use the wall suction,
set to continuous.

556
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:33,301
That'll do.

557
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:43,545
No electrocautery
to control the bleeding.

558
00:33:43,578 --> 00:33:45,313
You'll have to do this
combat style.

559
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:49,184
Tie off each artery
before you cut.

560
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,341
Dr. Reznick.

561
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:17,545
Are you ready?
Because I think we are.

562
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:24,352
I'll go get the patient.

563
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,229
You should lie down.

564
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,591
He's out.

565
00:35:04,426 --> 00:35:05,660
Scalpel.

566
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:23,278
If we expand the
quarantine, I can do the transplant.

567
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:24,846
The only technical breach
will be...

568
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,089
She's infected.

569
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:42,864
Melendez.

570
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:45,633
Yeah.

571
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:51,673
Take down the adhesions on the sigmoid.

572
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:55,643
How are his vitals?

573
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,247
Holding steady, Doctor.

574
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:03,117
That's dead bowel.

575
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:08,022
It's perforated.

576
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:09,090
Damn it.

577
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:16,398
NURSE
PETRINGA: I need a doctor!

578
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:17,799
Petringa needs help.

579
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:20,935
If I don't secure these clamps,

580
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:22,304
there'll be stool everywhere.

581
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:26,073
Murphy, go.

582
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:58,105
He signed a DNR.

583
00:36:58,139 --> 00:36:59,140
He shouldn't have.

584
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:02,176
This is battery.

585
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,511
He doesn't need to die.

586
00:37:03,545 --> 00:37:04,979
We're gonna get
his donor's marrow.

587
00:37:05,813 --> 00:37:07,114
Andrews agreed to the plan?

588
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:10,318
Not yet.

589
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:12,019
If he doesn't, we'll think
of something else.

590
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:32,039
He said he was
feeling lightheaded.

591
00:37:36,544 --> 00:37:39,013
I hear you,
but please stay back.

592
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:45,186
- He's...
- Is he infected?

593
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,888
From when Santa vomited on him?

594
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:48,356
He should go to isolation.

595
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:54,696
He's in...

596
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:56,030
hypoglycemic shock.

597
00:37:56,764 --> 00:37:57,999
Give him D50.

598
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,148
It's spreading.

599
00:38:14,181 --> 00:38:15,182
Kellan!

600
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:19,086
- DR.
- Kellan!

601
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,925
Kellan!

602
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,361
Kellan! Kellan!

603
00:38:26,394 --> 00:38:28,195
Kellan!

604
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:41,676
Dr. Glassman?

605
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,747
Hi.

606
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,449
We got what we needed for images.

607
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:48,550
You are okay to go.

608
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,552
We'll send them to Dr. Blaize.

609
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:51,986
Anything I should be worried about?

610
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:54,288
You're seeing Dr. Blaize
before the holiday?

611
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:58,760
As a matter of fact,
I'm seeing her now.

612
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:01,763
So, I could just show her
the hard copy.

613
00:39:01,796 --> 00:39:03,931
I'm not supposed to do that.
Oh, no. I know.

614
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,800
I've been a neurosurgeon
for, like, 100 years.

615
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,769
I understand protocol.
I'm not gonna look at it.

616
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:09,337
I just want
to move things along.

617
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:14,476
Thank you.

618
00:39:40,435 --> 00:39:41,603
It's back.

619
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:05,560
Suction.

620
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,599
I must've nicked a branch of the
inferior mesenteric artery.

621
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:12,667
I can't see where.

622
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,536
Can you feel it?

623
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:21,909
I think so. Use your
finger to plug the hole.

624
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,948
Now what?

625
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:30,685
Dr. Lim?

626
00:40:40,595 --> 00:40:42,396
Everyone, calm down.

627
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,365
Hey, Kellan!
Kellan! Look at me!

628
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:46,167
Look at me!
Breathe!

629
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,570
Can... Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

630
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:10,257
Help my son!
