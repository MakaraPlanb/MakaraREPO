and maybe the next girl
doesn't need our help.

149
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:26,518

No. Of course not.

166
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:19,471

and tell the truth and
be a good person,

but at the same time,

169
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:27,579

175
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,919
You're not excited?

176
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,121
I said, "Yes."

177
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:51,293
Paul has one year to live.

178
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:55,063
He has pancreatic cancer.

179
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:57,176
Stage III.

180
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,777
There are no metastatic
lesions, but there are

181
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,845
- local nodes involved.
- And there's partial encasement

182
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,380
of the superior mesenteric artery.

183
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:08,548
That puts it past the point

184
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:10,639
where we can cure with
local resection.

185
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,885
We could do Whipple surgery.

186
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:15,121
That's not advised for
stage III pancreatic cancer.

187
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:17,890
Not quite.
It's not advised for stage IV.

188
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:20,259
For stage III, it's discretionary.

- In my discretion,

190
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,722
he's better off with
12 semi-comfortable months,

191
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:26,034
rather than running the risk of
dying on the table tomorrow.

192
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,737
If he doesn't die on the table,
he could have many years.

193
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,814
<b><font face="Rockwell" color="#808080">CLAIRE:</font></b>
It isn't our call to make.

194
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,020
I'll talk to Paul,
advise him of the parameters,

195
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:34,513
let him make his own decision.

196
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,442
No.

197
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,230
Shaun should do it.

198
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,008
Claire can do it.

199
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,610
Yes, she can,
which is why you should do it.

200
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,612
This is a teaching hospital.

201
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:47,847
Andrews is right...

202
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:49,882
Being a surgeon isn't just
about cutting.

203
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:12,073
Would it be okay

204
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:14,837
if we spoke someplace
more quiet?

205
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:18,461
You need someplace quiet
to tell me I have acid reflux?

206
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,054
I think we should be
someplace quiet

207
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,389
because people sometimes
get very upset

208
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:28,091
when they find out
they probably only have

209
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:29,828
less than a year to live.

210
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:37,925
Okay, uh...

211
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:39,961
Can I call my family?

212
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:42,132
They should probably hear
what you have to say, too.

213
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:43,682
I'd rather just talk to...

214
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:45,433
Of course you can.

218
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,265

a little ahead of schedule.

219
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,634
Might be able to get her home
in time to do her homework.

220
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,860
Back to the bosom of her
loving family.

221
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,662
We'd remove as much
of the cancer as possible

222
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:08,439
by removing the head
of the pancreas

223
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:10,041
and other attached organs,

224
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:12,494
but then, we'd have to
reconstruct the anatomy.

225
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:13,972
The easiest way to do that

226
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:15,307
is to bring up a loop
of jejunum...

227
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,331
Shaun.

228
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,444
Sorry.

229
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:22,547
The jejunum is part
of the small intestine

230
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:24,182
between the duodenum and ileum.

231
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:27,945
It's complicated,
very dangerous surgery.

232
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:29,590
And even if it's successful,

233
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:32,627
post-operative complications
are frequent and serious.

234
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,261
And recovery can be very painful.

235
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:39,393
But if it works, he's better?
He'll be healthy?

236
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,295
He would still need chemotherapy

237
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,164
and a lifetime of monitoring.

238
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:46,056
But hopefully, a long lifetime.

239
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,443
Let's do it, Dad.

240
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:50,835

00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:54,951
What should I do?

242
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,942
It's your decision.

243
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:03,210
All we can do
is present you with the facts.

244
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:07,839
Yeah, here are the facts, Dad...

245
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,231
The surgery may kill you.

246
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:12,601
Not doing the surgery
will kill you.

247
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,005
Can you give us a few minutes?

248
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,307
Of course.

to give you an office,

I haven't decided yet.

256
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:46,756
You should definitely go with

257
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:50,165
Dr. Joshua Atkinson
at Stanford Medical Center.

258
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,235
His mortality index is .3.

259
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,735
It's too low.

260
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,272
Not enough of his patients
are dying?

261
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,341
No, Shaun,
sometimes patients die.

262
00:12:58,366 --> 00:12:59,844
Doesn't matter how good
the doctor is.

263
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:02,797
But when your mortality rate
is as low as Atkinson's,

264
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:04,775
it means you're
turning away patients.

265
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,877
You turn away patients,
it means you lack confidence.

266
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:10,106
You lack confidence, I don't
want you inside my head.

267
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:12,510

to dress myself

268
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:13,902

00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:18,382
Shaun, what are you doing here?

270
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:21,453
You showed up at work early
this morning.

271
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:23,412
Go home. Get some rest.

272
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,802
I won't rest if I go home.

273
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:38,859

What if this means there's still

What if this means we can
actually reconstruct her clitoris

and that it's capable of sensation?

304
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,106
Maybe. All we know for sure

on the table.

346
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:32,426
See, that's the difference
between you and Melendez.

347
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,896
I have no doubt that as soon
as I got this promotion,

348
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,866
Melendez had done the math
and reacted accordingly.

349
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,174
But I suspect that even
if you had done the math,

350
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:44,811
it wouldn't have changed
how you handled this patient.

351
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,340
I don't view that as a weakness.

352

the administrative fallout.

real name,

514
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:11,529
We have a chance to give her

a healthy, meaningful sex life.

516
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:16,336
That is what she came here
looking for.

518
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:26,530

cosmetic surgery.

522
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,549
From everything I've heard,

523
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:36,517
she's mature enough
to make the call herself,

524
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:39,120
even if it means suffering
for a few minutes to do so.

525
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:46,476
Dr. Unger has a mortality index

526
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,912
that is not too high
and not too low.

527
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:50,280
It's not gonna be Unger.

528

I may have to go out of state
to find a neurosurgeon.

531

Plus, I may have to find
myself a new oncologist.

532
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:03,682
You've used Dr. Ko many times.

533
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:05,852
Did you think
she might kill your patients?

534
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:07,007
No.

535
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,876

than them?

536
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,702
Yes, a little.

537
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:16,112
That was a joke.

538
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,075
You don't want to talk about this.

539
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,246
No, I don't want
to talk about this, Shaun.

540
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:24,250
That, in fact, is the point

Why can't we talk about it?

544
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:39,772
Because it's upsetting.

545
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:41,575
Is that why you're stalling?

546
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,611
Because you're afraid of dying?

547
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:45,847
I'm not afraid of dying.

548
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,617
Really?

549
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:49,186
Why not?

550
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:52,324
You should be.
Dying is terrible.

551
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,983
Yes, dying is terrible.

552

Not dying.

555
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,741
That doesn't make sense.

556
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:08,966
Makes sense to me.

557

That's the middle ground, Shaun.

559
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,175
Brain surgeries have a tendency

560
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:19,510
to end in the middle ground.

561
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:22,380
Brain surgeries can be
considered a success

562

ends up compromised.
