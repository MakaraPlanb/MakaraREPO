Nothing.

00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:20,736
There... that slight shadow
on the bronchus.

A slow-growing carcinoid tumor

422
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,540
could cause chronic airway inflammation.

423
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,441
As the tumor grows, symptoms worsen,

424
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:29,177
leading to airway obstruction
and infection.

425
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,313

Riley's body's already compromised.

432
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:43,725
There are no obvious lesions,

433
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:45,360
and her symptoms
are more likely indicators

434
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:46,962
of a simple sinus infection.

435
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:49,565

to treat with antibiotics.
