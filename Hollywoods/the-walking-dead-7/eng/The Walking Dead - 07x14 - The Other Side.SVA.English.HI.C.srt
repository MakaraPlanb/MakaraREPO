You know, what I'm saying is,

550
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,444
I look out for my friends,

551
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,348
and I realized...
we're not friends.

552
00:42:07,384 --> 00:42:10,118
[Knock on door]
Come in.

553
00:42:11,621 --> 00:42:13,855
Ah, wonderful --
tequila.

554
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,691
Crack that open for me,
would you?

555
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:18,026
You may go now.

556
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:20,461
Show him out, will you, Kal?

557
00:42:29,906 --> 00:42:31,406
[Sighs]

558
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:36,878
Everything okay?

559
00:42:36,913 --> 00:42:40,348
Where's Sasha and Rosita?

560
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,018
You see that over there?

561
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:47,121
That is a half-assed attempt
at a safety protocol.

562
00:42:47,157 --> 00:42:49,657
We need a full-assed,
full-court press.

563
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,159
That stuff out front

564
00:42:51,228 --> 00:42:52,393
with the spikes
and the chains and the heads,

565
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:53,761
that's good for the optics.

566
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,530
It sends a message
to would-be intruders

567
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:57,432
of the "Don't Mess
with Texas" variety.

568
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:59,033
[Inhales deeply]

569
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:01,870
But we need to drill down
on actual safety protocol,

570
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:04,539
especially at points
that have proven to be janky.

571
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:05,907
Well, yeah.

572
00:43:05,942 --> 00:43:08,076
That's why
I'm on guard duty now.

573
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:10,011
No offense to that last guy,

574
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,779
but he could hardly
handle a gun.

575
00:43:11,815 --> 00:43:13,081
[Silenced gunshot]

576
00:43:13,116 --> 00:43:14,282
[Body thuds]

577
00:43:14,317 --> 00:43:17,051
Get up.
You're getting out.

578
00:43:20,657 --> 00:43:22,590
Eugene, get up.

579
00:43:22,626 --> 00:43:24,659
We're breaking you out.

580
00:43:26,162 --> 00:43:27,829
Eugene!

581
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,766
No.

582
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:34,836
I'm not going with you.

583
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:36,104
What?

584
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:40,508
I didn't ask you to come, so go.

585
00:43:42,012 --> 00:43:44,512
People got to be en route.

586
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:55,857
[Door closes]

587
00:43:55,892 --> 00:44:00,161
That weak, lying sack of shit.

588
00:44:01,665 --> 00:44:03,331
This is it.

589
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:06,234
I'm going in.

590
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,702
Hold on.

591
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,370
This is gonna take a second.

592
00:44:09,406 --> 00:44:10,705
More could be coming back.

593
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,206
Keep an eye out.

594
00:44:15,045 --> 00:44:16,477
[Fence clattering]

595
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:23,017
Just another second.

596
00:44:27,657 --> 00:44:30,758
What the hell are you doing?

597
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:32,260
Go.

598
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,062
It's not your time.

599
00:44:34,097 --> 00:44:37,665
There's got to be
a point to it, right?

600
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:39,133
They need you.

601
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,175
[Silenced gunshot]

602
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:50,945
[Groans]

603
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:54,682
[Indistinct shouting,
machine-gun fire]

604
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:59,854
[Machine-gun fire continues]

605
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:15,303
[Crying]

606
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,006
Damn it.

607
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,742
Damn it!

608
00:45:20,777 --> 00:45:23,644
[Sobbing]

609
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,385
