1
00:00:00,412 --> 00:00:03,681
Previously, on
AMC's "The Walking Dead."

2
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:08,986
Carol's still out here.

3
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:10,221
And I will find her.

4
00:00:10,323 --> 00:00:11,188
You go.

5
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:18,629
Just let me go!

6
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:19,830
It's not your time.

7
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:24,168
You are gonna come back from this.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,336
What happened here?

9
00:00:25,438 --> 00:00:26,737
She needs help.

10
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,706
Then let's get you some help.

11
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:54,006
It'll be dark soon.

12
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,473
It's not much further.

13
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:58,905
We have people who can patch her up.

14
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:03,539
What are you doing?

15
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,841
I'm marking our way back.

16
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:26,862
On your left!
‭I've got it.

17
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:56,919
‭

18
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:43,032
Whoa.

19
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,100
Daniel. Colton.

20
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:48,270
Good.

21
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:50,739
We've been looking for you.

22
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,975
It looks like you found
some people yourself.

23
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:14,623
How long have I been asleep?

24
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:19,094
Two days, more or less.

25
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:30,506
Where are we?

26
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,408
Doctor says
you're healing up --

27
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,443
said it could have been much worse,

28
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:36,578
but you had some luck.

29
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,448
And your pack
with the weapons --

30
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,750
they wanted to lock them up.

31
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:45,187
Seeing as they were helping us,
I didn't argue.

32
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,624
It'll be with them
until we're ready to leave.

33
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:51,193
I figure that'll be another week,

34
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:52,795
maybe a little more,

35
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:55,864
and then
we can start back to Alexandria.

36
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:00,469
What is this place?
‭Well, the people here --

37
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:08,277
they, um, they call this place
"The Kingdom."

38
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:17,886
They were helping you...

39
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,655
so I've been helping them.

40
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:22,458
Hey.

41
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:27,129
Yeah.

42
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:30,532
Did you -- Did you tell them
about what happened to me,

43
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:31,800
about who we are?

44
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:33,502
Why?
Who are we, Carol?

45
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:35,971
What did you tell them?

46
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:37,906
They saw what that man did to you,

47
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,676
and they saw what I did to him.

48
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,144
We got split up.

49
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,079
You found trouble.
I found you.

50
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:45,614
That is all he knows.

51
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,182
All who knows?

52
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,917
The man
I'm taking you to see --

53
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,153
the person who's in charge
of this place.

54
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:53,322
This person have a name?

55
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:59,228
Morgan?
‭Yeah.

56
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,562
He, um...

57
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,234
...he's called
"King Ezekiel."

58
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:06,535
What?

59
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:07,736
Yeah.

60
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:09,404
King Ezekiel.

61
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:14,676
And, um...

62
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:17,746
he does his own thing.

63
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:19,348
See?

64
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:25,387
Uh, what does that mean?

65
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,622
Well...

66
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:30,192
here we are.

67
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,368
Yeah.

68
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,305
I, uh, I forgot to say that...

69
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:46,241
Ezekiel has a tiger.

70
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:28,321

71
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,285
Shiva, enough.

72
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:39,255
The fair maiden has been through
a myriad of trials.

73
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:43,493
They are our guests.

74
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:45,128
Chill it up,
"S."

75
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,529
Chill it up!

76
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:51,300
Jerry, you are a faithful steward,

77
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:54,637
but your words
leave me pitch-kettled.

78
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,840
I understand your concern, Shiva.

79
00:08:57,842 --> 00:08:59,776
You haven't met Carol.

80
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:01,010
Nor have I.

81
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:03,146
But if she is a friend of Morgan,

82
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:05,782
we shall consider her
a friend of the realm

83
00:09:05,784 --> 00:09:07,216
until proven otherwise.

84
00:09:07,218 --> 00:09:10,053
She's doing better,

85
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:12,622
thanks to you and your people, so...

86
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:14,023
Indeed.

87
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:17,527
It pleases me to see you
up and about, Carol.

88
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,729
I am King Ezekiel.

89
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:22,465
Welcome to the Kingdom.

90
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:41,017
You have been addressed by
the king, yet you remain silent.

91
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:43,886
Do I detect skepticism?

92
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:46,989
Perhaps you think me mad.

93
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:49,759
Perhaps you see this place
as nothing more than a mirage.

94
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:53,763
So...tell me...

95
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:56,566
what do you think
of The Kingdom, Carol?

96
00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:00,336
What do you think of the king?

97
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:09,946
I...think
you're amazing.

98
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:11,881
It's amazing.

99
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,183
And your Sheba --

100
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:16,619
It's, uh, "Shiva."

101
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:18,554
Shiva.

102
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:20,857
Amazing.

103
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:24,694
I would be speechless
if I wasn't already speaking.

104
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,334
I don't know what the hell's going on

105
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,935
in the most wonderful way.

106
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:34,007
As Morgan is aware, I encourage
those who find respite here

107
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,610
to enjoy the fruits of our grandeur

108
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:40,280
for as long as they like,
so long as they contribute.

109
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:43,283
Drink from the well,
replenish the well...

110
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:45,585
once you've healed, of course.

111
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:47,120
Of course.

112
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:48,716
Of course.
All about the well.

113
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:52,158
Well-said.

114
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,593
Jerry...

115
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:56,029
Ah, where are my manners?

116
00:10:57,466 --> 00:11:00,033
Please, partake.

117
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:04,271
We have magnificent apples,
nectarines, pomegranates --

118
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:07,541
all grown right here
inside the kingdom.

119
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,843
It's fruit time.

120
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:11,778
I-I couldn't.

121
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,813
Oh, come, now.

122
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,682
At least take a pomegranate.

123
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:18,552
You know, I always found them
too much trouble.

124
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,820
Sweet fruit
surrounded by bitter --

125
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:23,223
they're something of a contradiction,

126
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,958
but heaven for the effort.

127
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,728
You park some chocolate in front
of me and watch it go bye-bye,

128
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,933
but pomegranates --
just not for me, thanks.

129
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:34,434
Well, if there's anything
you want or need --

130
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:36,002
if you enjoy music,

131
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:39,539
we have a guitarist whose talent
brings tears to the eye,

132
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,474
and we have a small choir.

133
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:42,842
Thank you.

134
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:45,245
All I need is some more rest...

135
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,180
and maybe a hairbrush.

136
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,917
No one told me
I'd be meeting royalty.

137
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,721
Anyway...

138
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:57,223
uh, Your Majesty --

139
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,659
I should call you
"Your Majesty," right?

140
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:01,094
You can.

141
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,097
Thank you, Your Majesty.

142
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,032
It's a pleasure.

143
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:08,268
The pleasure is mine, Carol.

144
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,836
Be well.

145
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,616
Hey.

146
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,317
Hi.

147
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,887
Look, I know.

148
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,422
You're shitting me, right?

149
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:30,890
Now, it's --
it's a lot.

150
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:32,292
He is, um...

151
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,294
I don't know.
It -- It --

152
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,929
Stop it.
Stop this.

153
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:38,064
This place
is a damn circus --

154
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:39,532
all of it.

155
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:41,701
Th-These people --
this is make-believe.

156
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:43,203
It's playtime.

157
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,537
And you're just...

158
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:47,941
I can't do this.
I can't be here.

159
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:50,076
Look, Carol,
these people found --

160
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:51,911
No, I can't, Morgan.
I won't.

161
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:53,279
I'll wait.

162
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:55,482
And when you're not there to stop me,

163
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,751
when nobody else is, I'll go.

164
00:12:57,753 --> 00:12:59,052
You know I can't let you.

165
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,553
No. I'll --

166
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:01,921
You'll what?

167
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:03,957
Tie me up like that wolf?

168
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,325
Is that it?

169
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:08,928
It isn't up to you.

170
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,931
It wasn't before in the basement,

171
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,000
it wasn't at the library,
and it isn't now.

172
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,335
I don't give a shit

173
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,137
if you think
you've found the secret to life.

174
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:18,705
I --
‭No, I don't. I don't.

175
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:21,141
I don't, and I haven't.
And I know what I've started.

176
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,784
But I won't let you die out there.

177
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:33,319
That's what I won't do.

178
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:42,362
It doesn't matter what you do.

179
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:11,191
Where we going?

180
00:14:11,193 --> 00:14:13,059
Hunting.
‭Hunting what?

181
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,862
What was once captive to the farm

182
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:18,164
now runs free in the city.

183
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,399
‭Here!

184
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,900
- Come on!
- Come on!

185
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,235
Come on!
Come on! Whoo!

186
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,636
Come on!
‭Come on!

187
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:25,638
Turn! Turn!
Whoo, whoo! ‭Come on!

188
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,173
Hunting!
‭Go now! Go now!

189
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:28,374
Go!
‭Come on!

190
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:29,476
Go now! Go now!
‭Come on!

191
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,046
Go now! Go now!
Go! ‭Come on!

192
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:35,849
Go!

193
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:37,550
Well-done,
Richard.

194
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:41,187
It's just what we needed.

195
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:47,026
Why the Walker?

196
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:51,030
We're herding them in.
Why do you need bait?

197
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:54,200
Because I want their bellies
full of rot.

198
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:57,403
That's why.

199
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:06,346
You shoot a machine gun
in the woods, and nothing.

200
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:08,248
You cough in the city, and...

201
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:12,018
Diane, retrieve the truck.

202
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,721
We'll take our leave.

203
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:23,263
Ben...

204
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:26,900
you're up.

205
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:28,768
Use the machete.

206
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,539
Just as you and he have practiced.

207
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,441
Yeah.
Like we practiced.

208
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,581
Do not be troubled, Benjamin.

209
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,903
Next time.

210
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,677
No one back home
needs to know about this.

211
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,412
You mean the pigs --

212
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:14,314
that they're eating the dead?

213
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:17,750
Any of it.

214
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,794
‭

215
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:37,237
May we one day cease you all
from this curse!

216
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,838
Till then, know that
we live on in your place...

217
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:42,414
...full, festive,
faithful, and free.

218
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,478
Only halfway free.

219
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,475
Where are they going?

220
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:09,277
Somewhere else.

221
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:39,367
Your skill with the staff...

222
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:44,372
...how did you come to acquire
that skill?

223
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:48,777
It was a cheesemaker, a friend.

224
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,072
I imagine your comrade would be
very proud of you this day.

225
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,709
For saving Ben in a single blow.

226
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,980
There's a saying --

227
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,551
the pessimist looks down
and hits his head.

228
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,553
The optimist looks up...

229
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,722
and loses his footing.

230
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,858
The realist looks forward

231
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,527
and adjusts his path accordingly.

232
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,933
I believe young Benjamin's path
is in need of adjustment.

233
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,638
Would you train him,
as your friend trained you?

234
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,173
I don't...

235
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,441
I don't know
that I'm the --

236
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,743
Benjamin has shown aptitude

237
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,212
with neither blades nor munitions.

238
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,181
Perhaps his failings lie
in the weapons...

239
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,584
perhaps it's the teacher...

240
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,552
and perhaps it's both.

241
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,654
Hey, look, you know....

242
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,290
the man I shot
to save Carol --

243
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,127
the stick couldn't have saved her.

244
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:55,399
Has it saved you?

245
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,104
Yeah.

246
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:05,208
Young Benjamin will become
an important member of my court.

247
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,245
I need the boy to...

248
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,814
I need him to live.

249
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,285
Please.

250
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,589
Okay.

251
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,432
The Kingdom is favored
by your presence once more!

252
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:42,012
♪ Well, it ain't no use
to sit and wonder why, babe ♪

‭Over the head.

Swing it back and up.

259
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,530
I mean, it was flavor
on top of flavor.

260
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,732
It was like a goddamn dream.

261
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,936

Now, I like the lunch cobbler.

265
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,779
There's lunch cobbler?

266
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,582
We have cobbler at every meal.

267
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,385
Oh!

268
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,524
I'm just so...

269
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,292
I just -- I can't.

‭Oh, geez.

Do you have any tissues?

274
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,569
Yeah, one second.

275
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:48,064
Hey, what's the book?

276
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,768
It's, uh --
It's philosophy.

277
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,970
You know, we should really
get back to what we were doing.

278
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,338
You mind if I borrow it?

279
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,009
I've just read
every book in this place...

280
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,810
twice...

281
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,246
including an air-conditioning
repair textbook.

282
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,581
‭

283
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,583
Just so you know,
the number-one problem

284
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,786
with an HVAC system
isn't refrigerant leaks.

285
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,254
Yeah.

286
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,789
Won't spoil that one for you.

287
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,793
Please?

288
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,831
Here.

289
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,871
Gentlemen...

290
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,540
come with us, both of you.

291
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,244
We have matters of import
to attend to.

292
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,713
Bring your gun, Morgan.

293
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,689
The swine
are slaughtered

294
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,957
far from The Kingdom...

295
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:52,629
lest their screams carry in
the wind and invite questions.

296
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:57,734
What we are doing here is
a secret I keep from my people.

297
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,638
Some see secrets
as a privilege of ruling.

298
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,509
They are burdens,
not part of the reward.

299
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,744
They are the cost.

300
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,368
Here, I was worried
we were early.

301
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,970
Our arrangement

302
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,906
is something I consider
with the utmost seriousness.

303
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:40,310
We will fulfill our obligations
on time, every time.

304
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,681
Yes, indeedy, you do, and you will.

305
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,255
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

306
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:56,359
I count 8 --
that's good.

307
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,528
They look bigger than last time.
That's good, too.

308
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,863
They were well-fed.

309
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,757
I made sure of it.

310
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,026
We appreciate your hospitality.

311
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:07,930
Lucky for us, we brought two trucks.

312
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:12,101
How about you, uh,
help us load 'em up?

313
00:25:15,506 --> 00:25:17,206
They're part of another group.

314
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:19,641
They call themselves --
I know who they are.

315
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,546
Hey, asshole, how about a smile?

316
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:40,216
This --
This is nothing.

317
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:42,218
We've been letting you off easy.

318
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:49,959
You sure you don't
have that backwards, kid?

319
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,030
Yeah.

320
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:56,332
I'm sure.

321
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,741
Cease this.

322
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,054
Lower your weapons.

323
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:20,323
Richard...

324
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:22,525
let him go.

325
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:30,900
This is not what we do.

326
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:33,769
Free shot?

327
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:36,405
Oh, I love this shit.

328
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:42,678
Gavin, tell your man to stop.

329
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,214
‭Gavin!

330
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:48,517
Hey! Hey!
The man said stop!

331
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:51,120
And he's been good to us.

332
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:53,489
We've taken up
more than enough of his time.

333
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,942
Richard, we will discuss this.

334
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:15,211
Come on.

335
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:18,414
Same time next week,
Ezekiel, all right?

336
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:21,384
It's produce week,
so...produce.

337
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:24,720
You got the list --
not one bit less.

338
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,092
Otherwise...yoknow...

339
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:33,262
he's gonna have to go first.

340
00:27:45,276 --> 00:27:48,678
You've encountered them before?

341
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,146
Their group?

342
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:51,447
Yeah.

343
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:54,784
The man you killed
to save Carol --

344
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:57,620
he was one of them, as well?

345
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,488
He was, yeah.

346
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:05,027
Is that
why you wanted me here --

347
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:09,999
because I could do it again
if I had to?

348
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:11,434
No, Morgan.

349
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:14,770
Quite the opposite, in fact.

350
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:36,031
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

351
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:37,799
Where you going, hmm?

352
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,634
It's movie night tonight.

353
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,703
I want to get a good seat.

354
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:44,606
Right, but you were gonna
clean your plate, though, first.

355
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,311
Come on.
That was the deal, Dutch.

356
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,413
Yeah.
‭

357
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:54,149
Wow.
Good one, smart guy.

358
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:56,651
All right, well,
just be in bed by 10:00 --

359
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,120
not a minute later.

360
00:28:58,122 --> 00:28:59,387
But I can read?

361
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:00,956
Yes, you can read.

362
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,424
All right.

363
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:08,964
He's a good kid.

364
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:12,267
Yeah.
Yeah, he is.

365
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:15,937
I only kind of know
what I'm doing raising him.

366
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:19,474
Ezekiel's been a big help.

367
00:29:20,577 --> 00:29:22,077
You seem close...

368
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,512
you and the king.

369
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:27,048
Yeah, he was, uh,
pretty tight with my dad.

370
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:31,453
My father was a good fighter.

371
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:34,489
One of the best in The Kingdom.

372
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:36,591
How'd it happen?

373
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:43,198
It was about a year ago.

374
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,434
Ezekiel sent his detachment out
to clear out a building.

375
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:50,605
There was too many wasted
and not enough backup.

376
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,244
Eight men didn't make it out.

377
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:58,613
My father was one of 'em.

378
00:30:00,818 --> 00:30:05,620
But E-Ezekiel --
he's a lot more careful now.

379
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:11,059
He told me that it, uh, well...

380
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:14,362
He, uh, told me he was keeping
his deal with that group quiet

381
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:17,065
'cause he thinks
the people would want to fight.

382
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:22,370
He says that even if we did,
we wouldn't win --

383
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:25,173
at least,
not without losing people...

384
00:30:25,175 --> 00:30:26,485
maybe a lot of 'em.

385
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:29,811
And you think he's right...

386
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:32,047
that we shouldn't fight?

387
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:33,415
I don't know.

388
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,850
I mean...

389
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:36,585
I don't know
if I know enough to know.

390
00:30:37,855 --> 00:30:41,690
Maybe you do.

391
00:30:42,993 --> 00:30:44,659
Hey, um...

392
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:47,996
there was an inscription in the book.

393
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:51,566
It was handwritten --
about not killing.

394
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:54,035
Is it yours?
‭It's not, no.

395
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:55,871
'Cause I also noticed

396
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:58,907
you only put vegetables
on your plate during dinner.

397
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:00,709
And, I mean,
you're teaching me aikido,

398
00:31:00,711 --> 00:31:02,210
and if aikido means not to kill,

399
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:03,712
then that means
that you're --

400
00:31:03,714 --> 00:31:06,047
It's not about what I think.

401
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,515
People can --

402
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:10,752
They can try and set you
in the right direction,

403
00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:14,055
but they can't show you the way.

404
00:31:14,057 --> 00:31:18,894
You know, you got to find that
for yourself, and...

405
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:21,529
I thought I had it.

406
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:22,898
I did.

407
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,436
But I'm -- I'm just
fumbling through.

408
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:34,709
Sometimes, we change our minds.

409
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,613
Well, hey, do you want
to catch movie night?

410
00:31:41,615 --> 00:31:42,880
I can't.

411
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:44,882
I, uh...

412
00:31:44,884 --> 00:31:47,619
I got to talk to Carol.

413
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:49,287
But thank you.

414
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:50,248
By all means,
fair maiden.

415
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,449
Have one.

416
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:58,790
This enclosure was built

417
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,759
for the purpose
of common recreation and study.

418
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:06,331
I had it repurposed into
a garden worthy of our splendor.

419
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:10,835
I dare say it's my favorite
place in the entire Kingdom.

420
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:15,139
It pleases me that you've
seen it with your own eyes

421
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:18,676
before...choosing
to leave us so suddenly.

422
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:20,578
Geez, yeah, I...

423
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,848
I'm real sorry about this.

424
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,517
Um, it's just...

425
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,254
What good am I here?

426
00:33:30,824 --> 00:33:34,993
Jerry...
would you excuse us?

427
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:38,363
If you need me, holler.

428
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:40,598
I keep in hollering range.

429
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,501
Deuces!

430
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:49,207
If I hadn't
happened upon you right now...

431
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,011
What's that saying?

432
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:02,520
Never bullshit a bullshitter.

433
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:04,689
Have I got that right?

434
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:08,626
The sweet-and-innocent act
you've been doing --

435
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:10,228
it's quite clever.

436
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:12,830
Worked on me.

437
00:34:12,832 --> 00:34:15,667
Blend in, get people to trust you,

438
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:18,236
acquire what you need from them,

439
00:34:18,238 --> 00:34:23,041
and then you're gone,
as if you were never there.

440
00:34:23,043 --> 00:34:26,544
The guns you brought here
in your pack --

441
00:34:26,546 --> 00:34:28,846
they belong to Saviors.

442
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:31,883
What do you know about the Saviors?

443
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:34,919
More than I care to, unfortunately.

444
00:34:34,921 --> 00:34:37,622
They nearly extinguished you.

445
00:34:37,624 --> 00:34:41,659
But you did more than put up
a fight, Carol -- you won.

446
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:47,665
By ending up here?

447
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:51,936
That's funny to you?

448
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:56,774
You're a joke.
This place is.

449
00:34:56,776 --> 00:34:59,510
That's what you do
with jokes --

450
00:34:59,512 --> 00:35:00,945
you laugh.

451
00:35:00,947 --> 00:35:03,448
Out there --
Out there, it's real.

452
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,285
I've been to places where
I thought I wouldn't have to --

453
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:08,886
where I could just be.

454
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,657
You're selling these people
a fairy tale.

455
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:14,792
Maybe they need the fairy tale.

456
00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:17,428
Maybe the contradiction is the point.

457
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,130
And ruling over people

458
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:22,433
and having your ass kissed
by everyone's just a perk?

459
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,543
May I?

460
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:51,562
People want someone to follow.

461
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:56,234
It's human nature.

462
00:35:56,236 --> 00:36:00,171
They want someone
to make 'em feel safe.

463
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:03,941
And people who feel safe
are less dangerous...

464
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:06,411
more productive.

465
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:11,949
They see a dude
with a tiger, shoot --

466
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:16,687
they start tellin' stories
about finding it in the wild,

467
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:21,325
wrestling it into submission,
turning it into his pet.

468
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:24,495
They make the guy larger than life,

469
00:36:24,497 --> 00:36:26,164
a hero.

470
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:29,167
And who am I to burst their bubble?

471
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:33,371
Next thing you know,
they treat me like royalty.

472
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:37,642
They wanted --

473
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:42,380
They needed someone to follow,
s-so I-I acted the part.

474
00:36:45,018 --> 00:36:50,388
I faked it till I made it.

475
00:36:52,158 --> 00:36:54,425
I was a zookeeper.

476
00:36:58,198 --> 00:36:59,997
Shiva --
she fell into

477
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:03,101
one of the concrete moats
in her exhibit.

478
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:06,170
It was empty,
the vets were on their way,

479
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:08,406
but her leg was ripped open.

480
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:10,208
She was gonna bleed out.

481
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:15,513
The sound she made...

482
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:19,383
She was in so much pain.

483
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:24,455
I knew the risk.

484
00:37:24,457 --> 00:37:27,458
I had to try.

485
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,130
And I got my shirt up
around her leg...

486
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:34,031
saved her life.

487
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:38,436
After that, she never showed

488
00:37:38,438 --> 00:37:40,438
so much as a tooth in my direction.

489
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:47,445
Keeping a tiger
isn't practical -- I know.

490
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:49,514
She eats as much as 10 people.

491
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:52,283
She could yank the chain
out of my hand --

492
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:54,452
hell, she could
yank my arm right off.

493
00:37:56,055 --> 00:37:59,690
But she hasn't.

494
00:37:59,692 --> 00:38:02,894
She won't.

495
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:07,198
I lost a lot,
just like everybody else.

496
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,434
When it all started to end,

497
00:38:10,436 --> 00:38:14,071
I found myself back at the zoo.

498
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:18,876
Shiva was
one of the last animals left.

499
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:21,846
She was trapped...

500
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:24,282
hungry, alone.

501
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:29,987
Like me.

502
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:33,090
She was the last thing left
in this world that I loved.

503
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:38,095
She protected me.

504
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:43,167
She got me here,
made me larger than life.

505
00:38:43,169 --> 00:38:46,304
And I made this place.

506
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:50,808
I used to act
in community theater --

507
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,679
played a few kings in my day...

508
00:38:56,216 --> 00:38:58,783
...Arthur, Macbeth...

509
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:00,651
Martin Luther.

510
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:06,524
My name really is Ezekiel, though.

511
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:10,127
That's 100% real.

512
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:18,669
Cards on the table.

513
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:21,339
Nothing up my sleeve.

514
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:24,942
I'd appreciate you
keep this between us, though,

515
00:39:24,944 --> 00:39:26,544
for them.

516
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:30,781
And, yeah, a little bit for me.

517
00:39:35,822 --> 00:39:39,190
I don't care.

518
00:39:39,192 --> 00:39:42,360
You do what you want.

519
00:39:42,362 --> 00:39:45,162
I just want to go.

520
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:46,964
Go where?

521
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,168
Carol.

522
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:56,807
Away.

523
00:39:58,177 --> 00:40:00,745
I'm sorry.

524
00:40:00,747 --> 00:40:03,180
For what?

525
00:40:05,385 --> 00:40:09,020
For whatever bad you've been through.

526
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:13,424
There's so much of it
out there now, you know?

527
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:18,596
Too much.

528
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,235
Out there,
it feels like it's all bad,

529
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:27,204
especially when you're alone.

530
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:31,409
The thing is, though...

531
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:35,446
...it's not all bad.

532
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:39,417
It can't be.
It isn't.

533
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,187
Life isn't.

534
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:44,622
Where there's life,

535
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:51,228
there's pe, heroism, grace, and love.

536
00:40:52,765 --> 00:40:54,965
Where there's life, there's life.

537
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:57,935
I hope that's not
what you're walking away from.

538
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:02,440
So what if I am?

539
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:04,408
Maybe you don't have to.

540
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,444
I made my own world here.

541
00:41:06,446 --> 00:41:08,045
I found a way to deal with the bad

542
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:10,081
by going a little overboard
with all the good.

543
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,315
I just...

544
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:14,719
embraced the contradiction.

545
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:19,123
Maybe you could, too,
in your own way.

546
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:23,494
Like, maybe you could go
and...not go.

547
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:26,297
Yeah, I-I sound like
a crazy person.

548
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:27,565
I get it.

549
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,467
You know, maybe I am.

550
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:33,104
But I think I can help...

551
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:35,072
if you let me.

552
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:39,276
Why do you care?

553
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:45,316
'Cause it makes me feel good.

554
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:47,485
I'll get your stuff together,

555
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:50,488
find somebody I trust
to meet you at the gate,

556
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,524
so you can go
and -- and not go.

557
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:56,627
We'll see if I'm on to something

558
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:59,497
or if it's just more bullshit.

559
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:03,368
What do you say?

560
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:23,942
You're sure this is
what you want, right?

561
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,343
I am.

562
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,314
It's up to you.

563
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:34,953
It should have always been up to you.

564
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:40,992
Whoa.

565
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:43,728
Whoa.

566
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:55,740
Okay?

567
00:43:01,147 --> 00:43:03,348
Got it.

568
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:07,151
‭Stay there.

569
00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:08,586
It's good we're here.

570
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:11,856
‭How's that?

571
00:43:11,858 --> 00:43:13,791
10 more minutes,
and I might start to regret

572
00:43:13,793 --> 00:43:16,961
all the times
I tried to shoot and stab you.

573
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:24,369
I think you're my favorite
person I ever knocked out.

574
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:27,972
Definitely top two or three.

575
00:43:32,979 --> 00:43:35,613
Take care of yourself.

576
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:38,349
I will.
‭Do you promise?

577
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:41,953
Always watching,
always ready, remember?

578
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,123
I do.

579
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:48,826
Okay.

580
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:11,215
Thank you.

581
00:44:21,027 --> 00:44:22,493
Whoa.

582
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:38,837
You really got to try one of these.

583
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:51,579
