1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,360
<i>Previously, on AMC's
"The Walking Dead."</i>

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,500
That true?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,560
<i>You wanna help?</i>

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,870
I do.
<i>Okay.</i>

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,040
We have to get ready.
We have to fight.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,170
We do.

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,370
<i>We get you the guns,
we fight together.</i>

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
Say yes.
Yes.

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,110
They're out there, so I'm
gonna be there with you.

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,880
We are.

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,380
Package deal.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,720
You have to get me something.

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,320
A knife, a gun...

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,760
<i>This will do it.
It's a poison.</i>

15
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,060
Hey, darlin'.

16
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,030
Wake up.

17
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,600
Hey, darlin'.
Wake up.

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,400
What is it?
Do we need to...

19
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,070
no, no, no.
We're okay for now.

20
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,760
Well, good afternoon to you.

21
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,830
You're here.

22
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,030
Yeah.

23
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,000
And I'm feelin'
all kinds of glad

24
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,670
to see you right now.

25
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,940
Are they back?

26
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,980
Not yet.

27
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,283
I know
you were pullin' late shift,

28
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,520
and you wanna tonight,

29
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,690
so I didn't want to wake you up.

30
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,120
Maggie's in trouble.

31
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,660
What?

32
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,530
Something with the baby.

33
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,960
Rick's taking her
to the doctor at hilltop.

34
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,060
He doesn't know it yet,
but I'm going with him.

35
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,700
I just...

36
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,510
I know we just started this,
but I wanted you to...

37
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,910
don't.

38
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:43,050
"Don't" what?

39
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,720
Don't go.

40
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,660
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life, Sasha.

41
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:14,410
You are gonna help make sure
things get back on track today.

42
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,850
You are smart, hot as hell,

43
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,120
dignified as shit,

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,050
and you don't suffer
one goddamn fool.

45
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,220
No one's gonna wanna
watch you die.

46
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,290
<i>I</i> don't wanna see that.

47
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,560
So you don't have to.

48
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,530
But someone does.

49
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,240
Maybe a couple others...
tops.

50
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,070
But not you and not most people.

51
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,410
We are gonna help solve
some shit.

52
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,150
Tuck in.

53
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,950
Big day.

54
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,460
What do you need from me?

55
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,350
Look at me.

56
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,150
Why?

57
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,090
'Cause I want it stopped.

58
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,700
I want Negan dead.

59
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,300
So why don't you kill him?

60
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,900
Can't just be me.

61
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,870
They're<i> all</i> Negan.

62
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,510
That girl you murdered...

63
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,350
She had a name.

64
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,120
Her name was Denise,
and she was a doctor.

65
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,680
And she helped people.

66
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,890
I wasn't aiming for her.

67
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,130
Do it. Do it.

68
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,070
You wanna end it this way...

69
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,370
You go ahead.

70
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,020
I'm sorry.
I am.

71
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,790
I know you want to.

72
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,490
He could just be here
to see if you were here.

73
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,890
We can't trust him.

74
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,230
He owned me.

75
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,560
But not anymore.

76
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:53,270
What I did, I was doing it
for someone else.

77
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,410
She just got away.

78
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,780
So now I'm here.

79
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,220
So are you because of her.

80
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,850
Do it!

81
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,090
There's another choice.
Daryl.

82
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,960
Daryl, you knew her.
Negan trusts me.

83
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,760
We work together,
we can stop him.

84
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,280
You knew me then,
and you know me now.

85
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,050
You know I'm not lying.

86
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm not.

87
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,550
Do it.

88
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,250
Do it!

89
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,830
They have Sasha,
if she's even alive.

90
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,900
Why didn't you say something?

91
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,310
He could be our only chance
to get her back.

92
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,610
Because I don't trust him.

93
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,140
But I trust Daryl.

94
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,650
Negan's coming soon.

95
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,220
Tomorrow.

96
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,890
Three trucks probably.

97
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,490
20 saviors and him.

98
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,660
I can slow them down,

99
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,130
bring some trees down
in the road,

100
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,970
buy a little time
for you guys to get ready.

101
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,880
If you can take them out,
that's where we start.

102
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,650
You kill them, I'll radio
back to the sanctuary.

103
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,150
The sanctuary?

104
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,680
Where Negan lives.

105
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,850
That's what they call it.

106
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,390
I can radio back to them
and say everything's okay.

107
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,130
You drive the trucks back,

108
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,630
and I can lead you right inside,

109
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,330
and, with the right plan,
we can wipe out the rest.

110
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,000
Check to see if your friend's
still alive.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,170
Then, we get
the workers on our side,

112
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,740
build our numbers up,

113
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,550
and go from outpost
to outpost and end this.

114
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,760
Keep talking.

115
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,110
We just started it...
the whole thing.

116
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,710
If he's lyin', I'm gonna
kill him real slow.

117
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,350
When this is done,

118
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,620
I don't give a damn
if he's sorry.

119
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,790
I<i> will</i> kill that son of a bitch.

120
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,890
If he's lying,

121
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,330
this is already over.

122
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,940
Oh, I gotta go.

123
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,770
Oh, I gotta go.

124
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,570
Fact is, I figured we'd...

125
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,940
I had a dream.

126
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,450
You...

127
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,850
You had a dream about me?

128
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,420
You died.

129
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,120
That's the plan.

130
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,430
That's what I need from you.

131
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,500
And when you come out,
not a peep.

132
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,770
They will stand down,
if they haven't already.

133
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,670
And then, Lucille here,
well, she gets her three,

134
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,640
and we move forward
with a new understanding.

135
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,520
Are you...
are you shitting me?

136
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,160
Is that real?

137
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,330
I can do it,
but no one has to die.

138
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,630
You are wrong.

139
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,370
Punishment...

140
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,710
can't do anything without that.

141
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:47,250
Punishment is how we built
everything we have.

142
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,850
You think I'm gonna sit here
and let you...

143
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,650
careful!

144
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:00,830
You are not<i> letting</i> me
do anything.

145
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,900
No one has to die.

146
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,400
Okay.

147
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,370
How about this?

148
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,510
One.

149
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,350
Just one.

150
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,480
I mean, I was gonna
pull three outta the pool,

151
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,450
but just one

152
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,260
and just for you.

153
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,060
Okay.

154
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,370
Just one person has to die.

155
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,210
You got me wrapped
around your little finger.

156
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,350
You know that?

157
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,710
And it's not a man/woman thing.

158
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,020
I mean, if you had a dick,

159
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,520
I would still have
these feelings.

160
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,020
We roll out in 45.

161
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,410
So we don't have Oceanside,
but we have their guns.

162
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,010
Negan has Sasha.

163
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,450
Daryl wants us to trust Dwight.

164
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,650
Rick wants us to stay here
in case things go wrong

165
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,790
so there's another card to play,

166
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,460
another safe place
the saviors think they control.

167
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,230
But he doesn't know
that Gregory's gone...

168
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,830
That maybe
he's telling them things

169
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,730
that'll make them think
something else.

170
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,330
And it's all about to happen.

171
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,640
You're thinking of leading
the hilltop over there to fight.

172
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,100
I am.

173
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,070
If Negan finds out
they're planning something,

174
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,180
they're gonna need help,

175
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,040
even with those scavengers
on their side.

176
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,810
Well, you'd have
to decide right now,

177
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,150
and it's a very tough decision.

178
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,250
Why are you smiling?

179
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,260
'Cause I'm glad you're
the one making it for us.

180
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,670
How do I?

181
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,440
I don't know.

182
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,510
I just know you can.

183
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,810
Let me take her.

184
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,520
You take this.

185
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,320
Yeah.

186
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,060
Mm. Hmm?

187
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,140
Guns up, now.

188
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,810
What the hell?
He's dead.

189
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,010
What is it?

190
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,750
We've seen this before.

191
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,850
Same ones.

192
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,330
Dude, you okay?

193
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,670
You're gonna ambush them
on your own?

194
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,210
Yeah.

195
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,940
Going alone
doesn't work for this.

196
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,380
It works for me.

197
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,750
Have you killed any of them?

198
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,720
Because if you have
and they've found out,

199
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,290
they may think
it was the kingdom,

200
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,890
and we lose our advantage.

201
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,260
It's from walkers.

202
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,370
Can we move them aside?

203
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,210
Do you seek to extinguish
everything of who you were?

204
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:25,560
I don't seek it, but...

205
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,390
I'm stuck.

206
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,230
You want the saviors dead?

207
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,070
Morgan.
Yes, I do.

208
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,140
Cease this folly.

209
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,510
Accompany my regiment.

210
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,810
The saviors are a dragon
with many heads,

211
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,010
their numbers legion.

212
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,350
We must seek allies
in this endeavor.

213
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,190
That's Benjamin's armor.

214
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,460
Do you wear it to serve you,
or do you wear it in his honor?

215
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,940
Morgan...

216
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,980
You are not stuck.

217
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,510
Join us on this journey
to create an alliance.

218
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,680
Fight with us,

219
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:30,190
and we shall defeat them
so that no one will suffer

220
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,690
under their capricious
malevolence ever again.

221
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,710
And we start
once more for the fallen...

222
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,070
For the kingdom...

223
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,150
...for the glory of victory.

224
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,210
Ho!

225
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,060
What you fight for.

226
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,300
Not the place...
the people, each other.

227
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,340
You're a part of that now.

228
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,680
We take.
We don't bother... our way.

229
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,110
Maybe another way.

230
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:35,980
Yours?

231
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,850
Yeah, we're together.

232
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,490
I lay with him after.

233
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,830
You care?

234
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,870
We should get back to work.
Yeah.

235
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,500
Think this was them?

236
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,410
Crossed my mind.

237
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,880
We got a plan "B."

238
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,610
If I might be so bold...

239
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,410
This unexpected stoppage
has given me

240
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,520
the chance
for an exhaustive mull.

241
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,620
Now, given
the loaded circumstances

242
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,920
and potential for casualties
and resource expenditure,

243
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,890
I was wondering if you would
give me the opportunity

244
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,060
to attempt to slow their jets
and cool their roll.

245
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,930
You shoot one of these before?

246
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,730
Good.

247
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,000
Worry?

248
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,640
No.

249
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,440
Good.

250
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,450
I'll be on the next one over.
Why?

251
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,450
It's more sight lines
if we split up.

252
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,420
I'll go.

253
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,220
You sure?

254
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,290
Okay.

255
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,930
We win.

256
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah.

257
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,740
You know what's gonna happen,

258
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,810
how this is gonna end.

259
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,910
You know what's gonna happen,

260
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,350
how this is gonna end.

261
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,720
We're gonna walk
out that door together.

262
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,690
We kick shit and eat snakes.

263
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,130
That's us.
We can sit this one out.

264
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,460
They need us here, anyway.

265
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,370
Rick said to get ready
for a fight.

266
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,140
How'd I die?

267
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,780
We were at the beach.

268
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,480
It was before.

269
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,880
Mm.

270
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,920
You got pulled under...

271
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,390
And you didn't come back up.

272
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:07,030
I was trying to find you,
but you were gone.

273
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,960
And then, I started to drown.

274
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,830
I hate the beach.

275
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,470
End of the day in a wet suit?

276
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,710
It's like you're sandblasting
your nutsack

277
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,740
every single step
you take back to the car.

278
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,050
Luckily, the seaside ain't
on the agenda today.

279
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,280
Just security
and some road to chew.

280
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,090
All right?
So, come on.

281
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,090
Let's go help Maggie.
Abraham.

282
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,760
What?

283
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,930
They can use us here.

284
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,570
Just once, we sit one out.

285
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,740
Someone else...
it should be us.

286
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,210
Maggie's gotta take care
of Maggie.

287
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,950
Have you, uh, changed your mind

288
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,380
about taking
that allergy medication?

289
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,450
Yes.
Good.

290
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,360
I think you'll get adjusted
to the place, sinus-wise.

291
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,330
No, I won't.

292
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,100
Not like you.

293
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,600
Everyone has a way out.

294
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,470
Don't go and yuck my yum
for takin' mine,

295
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,870
which, I may add,
is the same as yours now.

296
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,540
If people die today, it's 'cause
of the choices<i> they</i> made.

297
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:30,110
Yeah. It is.

298
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,950
Why are we here?

299
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,032
For this.

300
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,950
Rosita.

301
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,010
Get into position.

302
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,780
I'll signal you.

303
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,150
And the wall's gonna hold?

304
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,360
It'll hold.

305
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,330
<i>All points are covered.</i>

306
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,970
<i>Every contingency is
already met.</i>

307
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,140
<i>I come armed
with two barrels of the truth.</i>

308
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,540
<i>A test is upon you,</i>

309
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,780
<i>and I'm giving out
the cheat sheet.</i>

310
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,060
<i>H-hello.</i>

311
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,330
<i>I come salved with the hope
that it is my dropped knowledge</i>

312
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,800
<i>that you heed.</i>

313
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,140
<i>Options are zero to none.</i>

314
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,070
<i>Compliance and fealty are
your only escape.</i>

315
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,540
<i>Bottom-lining it...
you may thrive, or you may die.</i>

316
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,180
<i>I sincerely wish for the former</i>

317
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,010
<i>for everyone's sake.</i>

318
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,750
<i>The jig is up
and in full effect.</i>

319
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,350
<i>Will you comply, Rick?</i>

320
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,530
Where's Negan?

321
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,840
I'm Negan.

322
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,660
No.

323
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,300
We win.

324
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,470
You ever hear the one about the
stupid little prick named Rick

325
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,800
who thought he knew shit
but didn't know shit

326
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,610
and got everyone he
that gave a shit about killed?

327
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,780
It's about you.

328
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,780
You're all gonna wanna put
your guns down now.

329
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,280
No one drops anything.

330
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,550
We had a deal.

331
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,750
Tamiel came for the boat things.

332
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,090
Followed ones who took.

333
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,130
Made a better deal.

334
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,070
You push me, and you push me.

335
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,600
And you push me, Rick.

336
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,210
You just tried
to blow us up, right?

337
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,050
I mean, I get me, my people.

338
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,050
But Eugene?

339
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,180
He's one of yours.

340
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,660
And after what he did...
he stepped up.

341
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,160
You people...

342
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,930
Are animals.

343
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,870
Universe gives you a sign,
and you just

344
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,100
shove your finger
right up its ass.

345
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,310
Dwight, Simon, chop-chop.

346
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:52,520
So, you don't like Eugene
anymore.

347
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,090
You guys<i> gotta</i> like Sasha.

348
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:02,390
I do, too.

349
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,030
Got her right here
packaged for your convenience,

350
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,870
alive and well.

351
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,340
Now, I brought her so I wouldn't
have to kill all of you,

352
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,280
and<i> not</i> killing all of you
could get complicated.

353
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,120
See, I know there's a lot of
firepower left in there, Rick.

354
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,450
So I'm gonna make this simple.

355
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,560
I want all the guns
you've managed to scrape up.

356
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,030
Yep, I know about those, too.

357
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:40,230
I want every last grain
of lemonade you got left.

358
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,540
I want a person
of your own choosing...

359
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,300
For Lucille.

360
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,440
Daryl...

361
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:58,320
ooh, I gotta get me
my Daryl back.

362
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,090
I see you.

363
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,990
And the pool table

364
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,820
and all the pool cues and chalk.

365
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,630
And I want it now

366
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,260
or Sasha dies,

367
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,470
and then all of you.

368
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,800
Probably.

369
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,100
C'mon, Rick.

370
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,640
Just because I brought her
in a casket

371
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,080
doesn't mean
she has to leave in it.

372
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,450
You know what?

373
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,460
You suck ass, Rick.

374
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,190
You really do.

375
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,830
I don't want
to have to kill her,

376
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,130
but that's exactly
what you're gonna make me do.

377
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,560
Let me see her.

378
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh.

379
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,210
All right.
Just give me a second.

380
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,610
I might have
to get her up to speed.

381
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,510
You can't hear shit
inside this thing.

382
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,320
Sash.

383
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,720
You're not gonna believe
this crap.

384
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:18,500
It felt real.

385
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,870
It felt real.

386
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,040
Like we lost this.

387
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,540
And this just started.

388
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,110
C'mon.
Wait.

389
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,120
I like the way
you call bullshit.

390
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,050
So let me return the favor.

391
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,660
The next thing
you're gonna tell me

392
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,730
is that you'll go
and that I can stay.

393
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,360
Because I know you didn't like
hearing yourself just say

394
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,230
that, "Maggie's gotta
take care of Maggie."

395
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,900
I know those words
are gonna choke in your ears

396
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,440
a good, long while

397
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,870
and you're gonna wanna make up
for even thinking that.

398
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,310
Am I right?

399
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:37,810
Yeah.

400
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,320
We lay our big meaties
across the chopping block

401
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,450
ahead of someone else's.

402
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,290
It's always for someone else.

403
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,190
Both of us know,
if we're gonna kick,

404
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,160
there sure as hell better be
a point to it.

405
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,770
So maybe we feel there was
a-a point to all of this.

406
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,840
Alpha to omega.

407
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,270
Whether it's
on the battlefield or the beach

408
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:13,140
or somewhere out there today.

409
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,780
Maggie...

410
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,620
she's carrying the future.

411
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,860
You're right.

412
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,030
I knew how this was gonna end.

413
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,470
C'mon.

414
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:44,140
Layin' your ass
on the line for someone else,

415
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,280
tearin' it to shreds for 'em...

416
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,550
you said it before.

417
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:55,150
Oh, my, that is living.

418
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,660
You're an idiot.

419
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,860
I never said otherwise.

420
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,520
A couple hours
to get there, right?

421
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,880
At least.

422
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,020
Might be a circuitous
and janky route.

423
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,260
With what they're planning,

424
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,060
they could be watching
the roads.

425
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,760
"What<i> they're</i> planning."

426
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,930
That's right.

427
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,360
Got it in the marketplace.
It's chock-full.

428
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,170
Doubt conversation will be
on tap for the commute.

429
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,170
And though
I am a selfish coward,

430
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,070
I do tend to think
of other people on occasion.

431
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,510
Please take it
with my compliments.

432
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,810
I truly wish I measured up.

433
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,950
You still can, Eugene.

434
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,590
I'm not giving up.

435
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,020
Not on you.

436
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,700
Jesus, you don't have to take
the trip in the thing.

437
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,070
I could use the rest.

438
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,600
No shit?

439
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,370
Yeah.

440
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,740
I just want to go to sleep.

441
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,040
I just need a little bottle
of water, and I'm fine.

442
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,540
Arat?

443
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,550
Listen...

444
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,090
I know how tough this is.

445
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,160
And I appreciate it.

446
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:55,070
Damn, you are something else.

447
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,670
Sash.

448
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,840
You're not gonna believe
this crap.

449
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,450
Holy goddamn!

450
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,380
Go! Go!

451
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,690
No.

452
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,800
Aah!

453
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,300
Honey, god damn it!

454
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,450
Plan "B" it is!

455
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,820
Down. Now.

456
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,790
We can make another deal.

457
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,090
Aah!

458
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,100
Aah!
