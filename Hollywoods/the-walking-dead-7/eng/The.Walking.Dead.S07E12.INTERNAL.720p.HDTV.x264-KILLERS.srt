<i>Previously on
AMC's "The Walking Dead"...</i>

2
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:05,848
We are the ones
who get things done.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,751
We can find a way to beat them.

4
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:11,287
<i>Tara, you've been out
further than any of us.</i>

5
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:13,255
<i>The least you can tell
is where not to look.</i>

6
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:14,689
Yeah.

7
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,124
<i>Sure thing.</i>

8
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:17,358
Don't do this.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,761
We need to wait
for the right moment.

10
00:00:19,863 --> 00:00:21,963
Guns.

11
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,098
A lot.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,933
<i>And then we fight your fight.</i>

13
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:26,134
Yes.

14
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,602
We have a deal.

15
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:25,223
Thanks for keeping watch
last night.

16
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:29,227
Oh, it's nothing.
I like it.

17
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:34,031
Uh, you can keep watch tonight.

18
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:40,403
We gonna win today?

19
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:41,938
Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,908
We're gonna need batteries
for that walkie, too.

21
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,678
Get it working again.

22
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:26,214
What is it?
What's that smile?

23
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:29,783
Couple of days out,
all we got to show are

24
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:31,651
two guns, dented cans of beans,

25
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,787
and some football jerseys,
pretty much.

26
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:36,089
Pretty much.

27
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:39,092
We're fightin' the fight.

28
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:41,561
It's better.

29
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,042
And if I hear one more
goddamn word about Fat Joey,

30
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,810
I'm gonna smash
somebody's teeth in.

31
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,878
Good riddance to dead weight.

32
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,247
No more mascot crap.

33
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,789
They got good taste
in pretzels.

34
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,524
And batteries.

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,031
Two days.
We're gonna need to get back.

36
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,204
Rick...

37
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,640
Day and a half more...
today and tomorrow.

38
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,145
We can come out again.
We should get back.

39
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:38,481
Just a little more.

40
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:40,716
We're okay.

41
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:43,552
We don't have to find them
right now.

42
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,754
Yeah, I know.

43
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:48,191
Just a little more, okay?

44
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:56,064
Okay.

45
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,399
Okay.

47
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,666
Hey, I was just coming over
to do that.

48
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:02,101
Denise showed me how.

49
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,605
I'm done.

50
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:08,841
What?

51
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:11,277
Nothing.

52
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,480
Okay.

53
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:17,216
It's gonna work out.

54
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,484
What... What does
that even mean, Tara?

55
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,220
It means we've got
the numbers to fight now.

56
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,821
We just need to find
some guns and...

57
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,557
Do you know where we could find
that many guns today?

58
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:29,561
This week?
This year?

59
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:33,163
No. You don't.

60
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:36,934
I can't just wait.

61
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,338
I don't know about you,
but I can't.

62
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,408
We're gonna find the guns, okay?
And we're gonna fight.

63
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,876
Look, it's not gonna be easy.

64
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,346
It wasn't the last time
at the outpost.

65
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:54,150
Hey, maybe you could
just save all this for them.

66
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:01,258
Here.

67
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,894
It'll help with your scar.

68
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,532
Keep it.

69
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:12,033
We need guns.

70
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,736
I'm gonna go find them.

71
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:04,417
Shh.

72
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,218
Shh.

73
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,937
Damn it.

74
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,672
What was it?

75
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:28,840
It was a deer.

76
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:33,610
I owe you a deer.

77
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:35,245
From before.

78
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,080
When they were outside the gate.

79
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,516
Oh, yeah, you do.

80
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:54,530
You see that?

81
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:57,667
Yeah.

82
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:28,362
It's guns like that.
That's why we're out here.

83
00:08:56,224 --> 00:09:00,426
Something serious happened here.

84
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:02,193
A long time ago.

85
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:05,764
Yeah.
These are serious rounds.

86
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,934
Might be serious guns here, too.

87
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,342
Let's get a better look.

88
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:20,110
Yeah.

89
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,278
Damn it.

90
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,252
Watch your step.

91
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:43,623
Maybe we shouldn't be
up here too long.

92
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,326
Well, let's see
what we're gonna see.

93
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:07,879
Soldiers, civilians,
all those rounds...

94
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:09,614
There was a fight.

95
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:12,017
Maybe it was the walkers.

96
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,217
Maybe just other people.

97
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:18,221
They're still wearing
their guns.

98
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:21,158
I think this is it.

99
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,528
I think it is, too.

100
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,329
Think we can?

101
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:00,195
Yeah, we can.

102
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:30,393
Are you okay?

103
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:32,161
Y-Yeah. Are you?

104
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:34,229
I am.

105
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:37,566
This is...
This is a sign, right?

106
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,903
This is it.
It has to be.

107
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,676
Oh-ho. It is.

108
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:54,114
Well, they're ready.

109
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:56,049
Let's eat.

110
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:28,980
I didn't find any guns.

111
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,949
In case you were wondering.

112
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:34,820
I was out there all day
and not a damn one.

113
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:38,957
Not a real one.

114
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,493
Thing is, I had a gun.

115
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,094
I was gonna use it
to kill Negan.

116
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:46,130
I was ready to.

117
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:48,666
And if I had done it,
like I'd planned to,

118
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:50,902
Negan would be dead right now.

119
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:55,840
And, yeah, maybe I'd be dead,
too, but who gives a damn?

120
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:59,275
Eugene would still be here.

121
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:02,345
Olivia would still be alive.

122
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:05,148
Spencer would still be alive.

123
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,518
And now they're gone,
and I'm here

124
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,689
because I was stupid enough
to listen to you.

125
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:16,158
But you were.

126
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,594
And you did.

127
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:25,200
You stand there telling people
about their lives.

128
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:29,204
Only if they come here.

129
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:33,441
Like you.

130
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,142
Right now.

131
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:39,146
You don't know shit about shit.

132
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:41,716
You're right.

133
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:43,485
I don't.

134
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:49,357
I said that you weren't
supposed to die

135
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,057
and that you shouldn't do
the thing

136
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,027
that you were planning to do

137
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,229
because we needed you...

138
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:58,899
still do.

139
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:01,735
Even a fool like me
could see that.

140
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:03,837
It's easier to be dead,

141
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,539
and if it's my fault
you're alive,

142
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,306
well, I'm just gonna have
to live with that.

143
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:10,342
I decided to meddle.

144
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,145
But I did something
I thought was right,

145
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:17,349
and I knew the stakes were
very high.

146
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:20,887
You can certainly blame me for
the fact that you have a life,

147
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,989
but after that what
are you going to do with it?

148
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:29,293
How are you going to make
what needs to happen happen?

149
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,598
Anything is possible
until your heart stops beating.

150
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,871
Certainly more than yelling
at a fool.

151
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:16,137
What?

152
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,574
Mmm.

153
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:25,581
How is it?

154
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,283
It's good.

155
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:34,755
- So, tomorrow...
- Mm-hmm.

156
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:38,392
...we go out there,
we get the weapons, right?

157
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:42,262
We get Jadis and her people
to fight with us.

158
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:45,332
We kill Negan and anyone else
we have to to win.

159
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,071
And what happens after that?

160
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:53,673
After that, we keep going.

161
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,375
Yeah, but...

162
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:59,378
Negan ordered the world his way.

163
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,983
It's up to us to reorder it
once he's gone, right?

164
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:08,186
All the different communities,

165
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:11,356
they can figure it out together,
how to keep going together.

166
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,526
Yeah, but somebody's gonna have
to make that happen.

167
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:17,162
Somebody will need to be
in charge of that, right?

168
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:19,564
Mm.

169
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:24,568
It should be you.

170
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,006
- Not me.
- Why not?

171
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,406
You could do it.

172
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:32,409
You'd be good at it.

173
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:34,879
I mean, if it's something
that you wanted.

174
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:42,085
Well, I don't think I do.
Or I would.

175
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:47,524
But the two of us, you and me,

176
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:51,494
reordering things together...

177
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:55,398
I want that.

178
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,168
If it's something you wanted.

179
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,773
Yeah.

180
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,259
I'm gonna eat five more
of these dinners, okay?

181
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,531
You know...

182
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:34,001
we don't have
to get it done tomorrow.

183
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:36,970
We can take our time.

184
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:38,605
If we go another day,
another one after that,

185
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:40,574
it's fine.

186
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:44,211
I mean, the place is clear.

187
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:46,714
It's locked up tight.

188
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,283
We found the only way in, so...

189
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:56,622
We should get back.

190
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:59,558
If we're getting the guns,

191
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,961
it doesn't matter
if it takes a little longer.

192
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:04,330
Wait.
I've been, um...

193
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:07,565
I've been waiting
to show you this one.

194
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:14,572
It's, um, chili
and mac and cheese...

195
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:16,441
together.

196
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:17,675
Come on.

197
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:20,387
Oh. Sorry.

198
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,857
I was just thinking.

199
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:30,697
Wh... You...
You want this?

200
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:33,733
Congrats.

201
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:35,167
It's yours.

202
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:39,105
Someone gave it to me,
someone who helped me.

203
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:42,474
She put her ass
on the line for me.

204
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,008
She saved my life, you know?

205
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,011
She didn't have to.
But she did.

206
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,447
That means something now...
it does.

207
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,849
It has to.

208
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:56,455
If I say something, you know...

209
00:20:56,457 --> 00:20:58,489
Rick won't leave there
without their guns.

210
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,090
If... If we could
even get close enough,

211
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:04,395
they'll start firing,
and we'll fire back.

212
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,434
I mean, they should
just fight with us.

213
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,503
The Saviors killed their fathers

214
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:16,640
and their sons
and their brothers.

215
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,475
They won't want
to fight with us.

216
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,109
They just want to hide.

217
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:28,351
So they'll just fight us.

218
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,321
I tell everyone about Oceanside,
that's what happens.

219
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,363
What makes our life worth more
than theirs?

220
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:46,702
Because we want to stop

221
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:50,171
the people that are hurting us,

222
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:52,873
who will hurt other people?

223
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,620
God damn it.

224
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:41,586
Look.

225
00:22:41,588 --> 00:22:44,723
The walkers in the field,
they're not closed in.

226
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:46,324
Uh-huh.

227
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:47,826
Yeah.

228
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:50,228
We got to take care
of the ones out here

229
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,030
and block that gap, too,
so we can take the rest slow.

230
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:58,001
Seven, eight...

231
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:02,406
nine...

232
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:05,709
That car...
I can block it up.

233
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:07,277
I can take out
that one on the way.

234
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,213
You draw the rest.

235
00:23:10,215 --> 00:23:11,948
You're leaving me eight.

236
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:16,419
We could shoot them,

237
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,953
but that would call the rest
from the field.

238
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:20,956
This is about doing it quiet,
with the sword.

239
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,026
You can handle eight.

240
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,198
Hey.

241
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:03,330
Hyah!

242
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:04,532
Hyah!

243
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:07,023
You got your eight walkers.
I can push.

244
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:08,525
So can I.

245
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:10,861
You just worry
about steering us in that gap.

246
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:16,231
Shit.

247
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:17,600
The brakes don't work.

248
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:45,727
Michonne, you good?

249
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:47,328
Yeah.

250
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,695
You?

251
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:51,965
Yeah.

252
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,101
I think we overshot it.

253
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:58,138
You think or you know?

254
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:01,808
I know.

255
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:06,412
It was a good plan, though.

256
00:26:06,414 --> 00:26:08,480
It was a great plan.

257
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,480
We'll do it here.

258
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,248
Yeah.

259
00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:47,087
Shit.
It's not gonna hold.

260
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:54,027
There it goes!

261
00:27:34,634 --> 00:27:36,734
Split them off
into smaller groups.

262
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:38,636
The barriers might hold.

263
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:40,638
You take slide,
I take Ferris wheel?

264
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,073
Or we could just go.

265
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:44,975
- You want to go?
- Nah. We can do this.

266
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:46,242
Yeah, I know we can.

267
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:47,101
How you doing?!

268
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:49,336
Eight more!

269
00:28:49,338 --> 00:28:51,137
How about you?

270
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,808
10!

271
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:17,462
Hyah!

272
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:55,832
Rick!

273
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:15,149
Rick!

274
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,114
Michonne!

275
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,597
Unh!

276
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,642
I tried,
but I still owe you one.

277
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,859
I could've gone
a couple more days.

278
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:58,796
I would've liked that.

279
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,540
I haven't been sleeping.

280
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:17,314
Thinking about what we lost.

281
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:24,720
Thinking about my friends.

282
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:27,856
Glenn saved me.

283
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,025
Right at the start.

284
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:34,096
I couldn't save him.

285
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:36,365
It's normal.

286
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:38,933
I know that.

287
00:34:38,935 --> 00:34:42,384
Being stuck on it.

288
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:45,139
We went through something.

289
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:48,109
This...
This doesn't cure it.

290
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,177
Rick, I'm sorry.

291
00:34:57,214 --> 00:35:01,249
We're gonna fight them.

292
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:05,720
That's what happens next.

293
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:07,888
And we're gonna lose people,

294
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,125
maybe a lot of them,
maybe even each other.

295
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:18,832
Even then, it'll be worth it.

296
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:22,936
When I thought that...

297
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,545
I can't lose you.

298
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,947
You asked me

299
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:40,620
what kind of life we had
just surrendering.

300
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:45,291
It wasn't...
It wasn't a life.

301
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:48,560
What we did back there,

302
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:51,429
what we're doing now,

303
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:53,831
making a future for Judith

304
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,500
and for Glenn and Maggie's baby,

305
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:58,870
fighting the fight,
that's living.

306
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:01,973
You showed me that.

307
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:04,141
You can lose me.

308
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:06,109
- No.
- Yes, you can.

309
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:09,380
I can lose you.

310
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:14,485
We can lose our friends,
people we love.

311
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:17,120
It's not about us anymore.

312
00:36:17,122 --> 00:36:21,524
It's about a future.

313
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:23,293
And if it's me
who doesn't make it,

314
00:36:23,295 --> 00:36:25,195
you're gonna have
to lead the others forward

315
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:27,630
because you're the one who can.

316
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:33,869
But...

317
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:36,872
how do you know?

318
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:39,575
Because...

319
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:43,144
you led me here.

320
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:54,089
Operational? All?

321
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:56,123
To the best
of my knowledge, yeah.

322
00:36:57,694 --> 00:37:01,596
May need some cleaning.
We found supplies.

323
00:37:01,598 --> 00:37:03,531
Expect us?

324
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,766
We cleaned some.
We oiled some.

325
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:07,901
You can do the rest.
We do this together.

326
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:10,271
Yes, yes, but operational?

327
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:12,972
Well, you can fire a few.
Try them out, if you like.

328
00:37:12,974 --> 00:37:15,275
- How many?
- 63.

329
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:16,743
We made an inventory.

330
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:19,145
No.

331
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:21,080
You mean the inventory?

332
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:24,917
- Not enough.
- What? Wha... What are you talking about?

333
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:27,186
You asked for a lot of guns.
That's what this is.

334
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:30,456
Enough to fight your fight.
Us? Nearly twice.

335
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,023
Need nearly twice.

336
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:33,259
We've wasted enough time.

337
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:34,660
Let's go.
Take our guns with us.

338
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:36,128
No.

339
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,698
Our guns to take.
Our deal still on.

340
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:45,370
Not all of them.

341
00:37:45,372 --> 00:37:48,239
We're keeping 10
for ourselves... to find more.

342
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:49,540
Five.

343
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:50,908
- 10.
- 6.

344
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,644
- 10.
- 9.

345
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,412
And the cat back.

346
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:00,117
20. I keep the cat.

347
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,320
We get you the guns.
We fight together.

348
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,955
Say yes.

349
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:11,127
Yes.

350
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:13,129
More soon, we'll fight.

351
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:40,922
You get a few more days

352
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:44,158
before "what happens next."

353
00:38:47,997 --> 00:38:49,397
Few more days?

354
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:51,366
That's right.

355
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:54,468
We'll find more, figure it out.

356
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,837
Soon.

357
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:59,473
In a few more days.

358
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:25,164
Hey.

359
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,532
Hey.

360
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,633
You all right?

361
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:31,837
Yeah, yeah, I was just... I was
just coming over to see you.

362
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,505
What's up?

363
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:35,273
Have you seen Rosita?

364
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:38,142
She didn't show for her
guard shift this morning.

365
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:42,881
She probably just went out
looking for more.

366
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,449
Mm. Yeah.

367
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:49,152
Why were you...

368
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,188
Why were you coming by?

369
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,596
I have something to tell you.

370
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,919
Hi.

371
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,428
Are you here...

372
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,630
I'm here
because I need your help.

373
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:48,409
One condition...

374
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:51,879
I get to take the shot.

375
00:40:53,782 --> 00:40:55,715
Okay.

376
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:02,088
Did you bring any explosives
from the bridge?

377
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,057
I thought about it.

378
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:06,259
But I didn't want anyone finding
out and trying to stop me.

379
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:08,495
I got something better, though.

380
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:25,310
So you can take your shot.

381
00:41:34,153 --> 00:41:36,387
Rick and Michonne found guns.

382
00:41:40,694 --> 00:41:42,326
But they aren't ready to move.

383
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:43,961
They can't.

384
00:41:43,963 --> 00:41:46,830
The need more guns,
more people, more time,

385
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:50,166
more excuses.

386
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:53,169
I memorized everything
Daryl and Carl told Rick

387
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:55,506
about the inside
of Negan's place.

388
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:59,409
Jesus made me a map
of the outside.

389
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:01,577
It's far away.
It's well-defended.

390
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:03,946
There's only two of us.
You changing your mind?

391
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:06,048
I'm ready to kill him.

392
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,584
But I need to make sure
you know what this means.

393
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:09,852
Do you?

394
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:16,526
They can't catch us alive.

395
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:18,760
If they do,
we give them something.

396
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:21,863
It's a one-way ticket
for both of us.

397
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:28,003
If it is both of us.

398
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:29,470
It is.

399
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:35,139
