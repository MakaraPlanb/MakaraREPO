735
00:55:47,975 --> 00:55:50,943
Maggie: I don't know how,
but I know she did.

736
00:55:56,884 --> 00:56:00,219
She gave us a chance.
You did.

737
00:56:00,221 --> 00:56:03,989
You made
the right decision to come.

738
00:56:03,991 --> 00:56:08,894
The decision was made
a long time ago,

739
00:56:08,896 --> 00:56:12,731
before any of us knew
each other,

740
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:14,333
when we were all strangers
who would have

741
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,868
just passed each other
on the street

742
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:20,372
before the world ended.

743
00:56:20,374 --> 00:56:22,908
And now we mean everything
to each other.

744
00:56:55,209 --> 00:56:57,710
[Knife unsheathes]

745
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:05,918
You were in trouble.
You were trapped.

746
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,188
Glenn didn't know you,
but he helped you.

747
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:15,027
He put himself in danger
for you.

748
00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:18,864
And that started it all --

749
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:23,369
From Atlanta,
to my daddy's farm,

750
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:25,771
to the prison,

751
00:57:25,773 --> 00:57:28,374
to here...

752
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:41,887
to this moment now...

753
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:45,758
not as strangers --

754
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
as family...

755
00:58:20,494 --> 00:58:25,964
because Glenn chose
to be there for you that day

756
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:28,867
a long time ago.

757
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:32,104
That was the decision
that changed everything.

758
00:58:40,714 --> 00:58:43,048
It started with both of you,

759
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,518
and it just grew...

760
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,890
to all of us...

761
00:58:51,892 --> 00:58:57,062
to sacrifice for each other...

762
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:11,977
to suffer and stand,

763
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:16,982
to grieve, to give,

764
00:59:16,984 --> 00:59:23,222
to love, to live...

765
00:59:23,224 --> 00:59:25,357
to fight for each other.

766
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:30,496
[no dialogue]

767
00:59:30,498 --> 00:59:34,933
Glenn made the decision, Rick.

768
00:59:34,935 --> 00:59:38,070
I was just following his lead.

769
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:50,127
