00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,304
Previously, on
AMC's "The Walking Dead."

2
00:00:03,544 --> 00:00:04,577
That true?

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:06,042
You wanna help?

4
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:09,364
I do.
Okay.

5
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:11,532
We have to get ready.
We have to fight.

6
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:12,667
We do.

7
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,870
We get you the
guns, we fight together.

8
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:18,373
Say yes.
Yes.

9
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:21,609
They're out there, so I'm
gonna be there with you.

10
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:23,378
We are.

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,879
Package deal.

12
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:26,214
You have to get me something.

13
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:27,815
A knife, a gun...

14
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:30,027
This will do it.
It's a poison.

23
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:16,190
Hey, darlin'.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,161
Wake up.

25
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:23,731
Hey, darlin'.
Wake up.

26
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,258
What is it?
Do we need to --

27
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:28,202
No, no, no.
We're okay for now.

28
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,725
Well, good afternoon to you.

29
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:55,794
You're here.

30
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:57,997
Yeah.

31
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,965
And I'm feelin'
all kinds of glad

32
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,663
to see you right now.

33
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,924
Are they back?

34
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:11,613
Not yet.

35
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:12,914
I know
you were pullin' late shift,

36
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,149
and you wanna tonight,

37
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:17,319
so I didn't want to wake you up.

38
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,754
Maggie's in trouble.

39
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:21,289
What?

40
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,158
Something with the baby.

41
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,593
Rick's taking her
to the doctor at Hilltop.

42
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:27,696
He doesn't know it yet,
but I'm going with him.

43
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:30,332
I just...

44
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:35,136
I know we just started this,
but I wanted you to --

45
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:37,539
Don't.

46
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:42,677
"Don't" what?

47
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:46,348
Don't go.

48
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:59,294
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life, Sasha.

49
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:14,042
You are gonna help make sure
things get back on track today.

50
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:17,479
You are smart, hot as hell,

51
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:18,747
dignified as shit,

52
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:22,684
and you don't suffer
one goddamn fool.

53
00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:24,853
No one's gonna wanna
watch you die.

54
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,921
I don't wanna see that.

55
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:31,192
So you don't have to.

56
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:33,161
But someone does.

57
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:37,866
Maybe a couple others --
tops.

58
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:43,705
But not you and not most people.

59
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:47,042
We are gonna help solve
some shit.

60
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:53,782
Tuck in.

61
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:55,583
Big day.

62
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:06,094
What do you need from me?

63
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:25,980
Look at me.

64
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,785
Why?

65
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:36,725
'Cause I want it stopped.

66
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:39,327
I want Negan dead.

67
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,929
So why don't you kill him?

68
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:42,530
Can't just be me.

69
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:45,500
They're all Negan.

70
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:49,137
That girl you murdered...

71
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:56,978
she had a name.

72
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,747
Her name was Denise,
and she was a doctor.

73
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:00,315
And she helped people.

74
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:04,519
I wasn't aiming for her.

75
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:16,765
Do it. Do it.

76
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:21,703
You wanna end it this way...

77
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:23,004
you go ahead.

78
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:31,646
I'm sorry.
I am.

79
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:36,418
I know you want to.

80
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,120
He could just be here
to see if you were here.

81
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,522
We can't trust him.

82
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:41,856
He owned me.

83
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:46,194
But not anymore.

84
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:52,901
What I did, I was doing it
for someone else.

85
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:57,038
She just got away.

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,410
So now I'm here.

87
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:05,847
So are you because of her.

88
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:09,484
Do it!

89
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,720
There's another choice.
Daryl.

90
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:15,590
Daryl, you knew her.
Negan trusts me.

91
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:20,395
We work together,
we can stop him.

92
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,906
You knew me then,
and you know me now.

93
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:34,676
You know I'm not lying.

94
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm not.

95
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,183
Do it.

96
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:43,885
Do it!

97
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,464
They have Sasha,
if she's even alive.

98
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:58,533
Why didn't you say something?

99
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:01,936
He could be our only chance
to get her back.

100
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:04,239
Because I don't trust him.

101
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,775
But I trust Daryl.

102
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:11,279
Negan's coming soon.

103
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:16,851
Tomorrow.

104
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:19,521
Three trucks probably.

105
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:21,122
20 Saviors and him.

106
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:26,294
I can slow them down,

107
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:28,763
bring some trees down
in the road,

108
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:34,602
buy a little time
for you guys to get ready.

109
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:39,507
If you can take them out,
that's where we start.

110
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:42,277
You kill them, I'll radio
back to the Sanctuary.

111
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,779
The Sanctuary?

112
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:47,315
Where Negan lives.

113
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:50,485
That's what they call it.

114
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:54,022
I can radio back to them
and say everything's okay.

115
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:55,757
You drive the trucks back,

116
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,258
and I can lead you right inside,

117
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,961
and, with the right plan,
we can wipe out the rest.

118
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:04,632
Check to see if your friend's
still alive.

119
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:07,802
Then, we get
the workers on our side,

120
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:11,372
build our numbers up,

121
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:16,177
and go from outpost
to outpost and end this.

122
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:28,389
Keep talking.

123
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:41,736
We just started it --
the whole thing.

124
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:46,341
If
he's lyin', I'm gonna kill him real slow.

125
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,979
When this is done,

126
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,247
I don't give a damn
if he's sorry.

127
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:55,416
I will kill that son of a bitch.

128
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:59,520
If he's lying,

129
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,956
this is already over.

130
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:26,104
♪ Someday we'll all be free,
yeah ♪

131
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:28,940
Oh, I gotta go.

132
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:31,106
Oh, I gotta go.

133
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:33,975
Fact is, I figured we'd --

134
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:37,345
I had a dream.

135
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:38,847
You...

136
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:42,250
You had a dream about me?

137
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:46,821
You died.

138
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:51,526
That's the plan.

139
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:53,828
That's what I need from you.

140
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,900
And when you come out,
not a peep.

141
00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:03,171
They will stand down,
if they haven't already.

142
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:07,075
And then, Lucille here,
well, she gets her three,

143
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:11,046
and we move forward
with a new understanding.

144
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:23,925
Are you --
Are you shitting me?

145
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:28,563
Is that real?

146
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:30,732
I can do it,
but no one has to die.

147
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:33,034
You are wrong.

148
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:35,770
Punishment --

149
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:40,108
can't do anything without that.

150
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:46,648
Punishment is how we built
everything we have.

151
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,250
You think I'm gonna sit here
and let you --

152
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:50,051
Careful!

153
00:11:52,623 --> 00:12:00,228
You are not letting me
do anything.

154
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,300
No one has to die.

155
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:10,305
Okay.

156
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:13,775
How about this?

157
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:15,910
One.

158
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:19,748
Just one.

159
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,883
I mean, I was gonna
pull three outta the pool,

160
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:24,853
but just one

161
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:29,658
and just for you.

162
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,459
Okay.

163
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:41,770
Just one person has to die.

164
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:51,613
You got me wrapped
around your little finger.

165
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:52,747
You know that?

166
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:55,116
And it's not a man/woman thing.

167
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:56,418
I mean, if you had a dick,

168
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,921
I would still have
these feelings.

169
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:05,427
We roll out in 45.

170
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:25,814
So we don't have Oceanside,
but we have their guns.

171
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:28,416
Negan has Sasha.

172
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,851
Daryl wants us to trust Dwight.

173
00:13:29,853 --> 00:13:32,053
Rick wants us to stay here
in case things go wrong

174
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:35,190
so there's another card to play,

175
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:37,859
another safe place
the Saviors think they control.

176
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:40,628
But he doesn't know
that Gregory's gone...

177
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,230
that maybe
he's telling them things

178
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,132
that'll make them think
something else.

179
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:47,736
And it's all about to happen.

180
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:50,038
You're thinking of leading
the Hilltop over there to fight.

181
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,506
I am.

182
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,475
If Negan finds out
they're planning something,

183
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:55,577
they're gonna need help,

184
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:57,445
even with those Scavengers
on their side.

185
00:13:57,447 --> 00:14:00,215
Well, you'd have
to decide right now,

186
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:04,552
and it's a very tough decision.

187
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,655
Why are you smiling?

188
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:10,658
'Cause I'm glad you're
the one making it for us.

189
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:25,073
How do I?

190
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:26,841
I don't know.

191
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,910
I just know you can.

192
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:34,215
Let me take her.

193
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:36,918
You take this.

194
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:39,721
Yeah.

195
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:42,457
Mm. Hmm?

196
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,542
Guns up, now.

197
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:07,215
What the hell?
He's dead.

198
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:08,416
What is it?

199
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,153
We've seen this before.

200
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:15,256
Same ones.

201
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:23,731
Dude, you okay?

202
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,073
You're gonna ambush them
on your own?

203
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:34,609
Yeah.

204
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:36,344
Going alone
doesn't work for this.

205
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:38,780
It works for me.

206
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,152
Have you killed any of them?

207
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:47,121
Because if you have
and they've found out,

208
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:48,690
they may think
it was the Kingdom,

209
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:50,291
and we lose our advantage.

210
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:58,666
It's from walkers.

211
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:00,768
Can we move them aside?

212
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:15,617
Do you seek to extinguish
everything of who you were?

213
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:24,959
I don't seek it, but...

214
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:27,795
I'm stuck.

215
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:31,633
You want the Saviors dead?

216
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:35,470
Morgan.
Yes, I do.

217
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:38,540
Cease this folly.

218
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,910
Accompany my regiment.

219
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:45,213
The Saviors are a dragon
with many heads,

220
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:47,415
their numbers legion.

221
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,752
We must seek allies
in this endeavor.

222
00:16:55,659 --> 00:17:00,595
That's Benjamin's armor.

223
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:04,866
Do you wear it to serve you,
or do you wear it in his honor?

224
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:10,338
Morgan...

225
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:17,378
you are not stuck.

226
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,916
Join us on this journey
to create an alliance.

227
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:25,086
Fight with us,

228
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:29,591
and we shall defeat them
so that no one will suffer

229
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:33,094
under their capricious
malevolence ever again.

230
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:47,108
And we start
once more for the fallen...

231
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,476
for the Kingdom...

232
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:52,547
...for the glory of victory.

233
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:54,616
Ho!

234
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,050
What you fight for.

235
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:24,289
Not the place --
the people, each other.

236
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,324
You're a part of that now.

237
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:30,662
We take.
We don't bother --our way.

238
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:33,097
Maybe another way.

239
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:39,971
Yours?

240
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,840
Yeah, we're together.

241
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:45,476
I lay with him after.

242
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:47,812
You care?

243
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:53,851
We should get back to work.
Yeah.

244
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:05,490
Think this was them?

245
00:21:05,492 --> 00:21:08,393
Crossed my mind.

246
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:10,862
We got a plan "B."

247
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:13,598
If I might be so bold...

248
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
this unexpected stoppage
has given me

249
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:17,502
the chance
for an exhaustive mull.

250
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:19,604
Now, given
the loaded circumstances

251
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:22,907
and potential for casualties
and resource expenditure,

252
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,876
I was wondering if you would
give me the opportunity

253
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:28,045
to attempt to slow their jets
and cool their roll.

254
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:03,915
You shoot one of these before?

255
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,716
Good.

256
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:09,987
Worry?

257
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:13,624
No.

258
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:17,428
Good.

259
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,431
I'll be on the next one over.
Why?

260
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:23,434
It's more sight lines
if we split up.

261
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:25,403
I'll go.

262
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:27,205
You sure?

263
00:22:28,408 --> 00:22:30,274
Okay.

264
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:40,918
We win.

265
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,987
Yeah.

266
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:12,108
You know what's gonna happen,

267
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,178
how this is gonna end.

268
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,282
You know what's gonna happen,

269
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:22,719
how this is gonna end.

270
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:27,090
We're gonna walk
out that door together.

271
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:30,060
We kick shit and eat snakes.

272
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:34,497
That's us.
We can sit this one out.

273
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:35,832
They need us here, anyway.

274
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:37,734
Rick said to get ready
for a fight.

275
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:43,506
How'd I die?

276
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:49,145
We were at the beach.

277
00:23:49,147 --> 00:23:50,847
It was before.

278
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:53,249
Mm.

279
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:56,286
You got pulled under...

280
00:23:56,288 --> 00:24:00,757
and you didn't come back up.

281
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:06,396
I was trying to find you,
but you were gone.

282
00:24:06,398 --> 00:24:08,331
And then, I started to drown.

283
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:12,202
I hate the beach.

284
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:16,840
End of the day in a wet suit?

285
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:19,075
It's like you're sandblasting
your nutsack

286
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:21,111
every single step
you take back to the car.

287
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:27,417
Luckily, the seaside ain't
on the agenda today.

288
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:30,654
Just security
and some road to chew.

289
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:33,456
All right?
So, come on.

290
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,459
Let's go help Maggie.
Abraham.

291
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:39,129
What?

292
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:41,297
They can use us here.

293
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:47,937
Just once, we sit one out.

294
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:50,106
Someone else --
It should be us.

295
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:52,575
Maggie's gotta take care
of Maggie.

296
00:24:57,182 --> 00:24:59,315
Have you, uh, changed your mind

297
00:24:59,317 --> 00:25:02,752
about taking
that allergy medication?

298
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:04,821
Yes.
Good.

299
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:09,726
I think you'll get adjusted
to the place, sinus-wise.

300
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:11,695
No, I won't.

301
00:25:11,697 --> 00:25:14,464
Not like you.

302
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:15,965
Everyone has a way out.

303
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,834
Don't go and yuck my yum
for takin' mine,

304
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:21,237
which, I may add,
is the same as yours now.

305
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:24,908
If people die today, it's 'cause
of the choices they made.

306
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,479
Yeah. It is.

307
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,316
Why are we here?

308
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:44,360
For this.

309
00:26:01,713 --> 00:26:04,314
Rosita.

310
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:06,382
Get into position.

311
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:10,153
I'll signal you.

312
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:12,522
And the wall's gonna hold?

313
00:26:12,524 --> 00:26:14,724
It'll hold.

314
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:26,703
All points are covered.

315
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:29,339
Every contingency is
already met.

316
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:32,509
I come armed
with two barrels of the truth.

317
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:33,910
A test is upon you,

318
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:36,146
and I'm giving out
the cheat sheet.

319
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,803
H-Hello.

320
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:57,072
I come salved with the hope
that it is my dropped knowledge

321
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,541
that you heed.

322
00:26:58,543 --> 00:27:01,877
Options are zero to none.

323
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,812
Compliance and fealty are
your only escape.

324
00:27:03,814 --> 00:27:08,284
Bottom-lining it --
You may thrive, or you may die.

325
00:27:08,286 --> 00:27:10,920
I sincerely wish for the former

326
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:13,756
for everyone's sake.

327
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:18,494
The jig is up
and in full effect.

328
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:21,096
Will you comply, Rick?

329
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:34,276
Where's Negan?

330
00:27:38,716 --> 00:27:40,583
I'm Negan.

331
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:40,402
No.

332
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,038
We win.

333
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,818
You ever hear the one about the
stupid little prick named Rick

334
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,412
who thought he knew shit
but didn't know shit

335
00:29:57,532 --> 00:30:01,959
and got everyone he
that gave a shit about killed?

336
00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:07,131
It's about you.

337
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,483
You're all gonna wanna put
your guns down now.

338
00:30:09,603 --> 00:30:13,637
No one drops anything.

339
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:14,905
We had a deal.

340
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:17,107
Tamiel came for the boat things.

341
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:20,444
Followed ones who took.

342
00:30:20,446 --> 00:30:22,479
Made a better deal.

343
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:29,420
You push me, and you push me.

344
00:30:29,422 --> 00:30:33,957
And you push me, Rick.

345
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,560
You just tried
to blow us up, right?

346
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:41,398
I mean, I get me, my people.

347
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,402
But Eugene?

348
00:30:45,404 --> 00:30:47,538
He's one of yours.

349
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,009
And after what he did --
He stepped up.

350
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:54,511
You people...

351
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:58,282
are animals.

352
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:01,218
Universe gives you a sign,
and you just

353
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,455
shove your finger
right up its ass.

354
00:31:07,393 --> 00:31:11,662
Dwight, Simon, chop-chop.

355
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:52,870
So, you don't like Eugene
anymore.

356
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:57,441
You guys gotta like Sasha.

357
00:31:57,443 --> 00:32:02,746
I do, too.

358
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:06,383
Got her right here
packaged for your convenience,

359
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:10,220
alive and well.

360
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:14,691
Now, I brought her so I wouldn't
have to kill all of you,

361
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:19,630
and not killing all of you
could get complicated.

362
00:32:19,632 --> 00:32:24,468
See, I know there's a lot of
firepower left in there, Rick.

363
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,805
So I'm gonna make this simple.

364
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:31,909
I want all the guns
you've managed to scrape up.

365
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:35,379
Yep, I know about those, too.

366
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:40,584
I want every last grain
of lemonade you got left.

367
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:45,889
I want a person
of your own choosing...

368
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:47,658
for Lucille.

369
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,797
Daryl --

370
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:58,669
Ooh, I gotta get me
my Daryl back.

371
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:01,438
I see you.

372
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,340
And the pool table

373
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:05,175
and all the pool cues and chalk.

374
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:07,978
And I want it now

375
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,614
or Sasha dies,

376
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:14,818
and then all of you.

377
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,155
Probably.

378
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:20,457
C'mon, Rick.

379
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:22,993
Just because I brought her
in a casket

380
00:33:22,995 --> 00:33:25,429
doesn't mean
she has to leave in it.

381
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:35,806
You know what?

382
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:38,809
You suck ass, Rick.

383
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:40,544
You really do.

384
00:33:40,546 --> 00:33:42,179
I don't want
to have to kill her,

385
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:44,481
but that's exactly
what you're gonna make me do.

386
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:46,917
Let me see her.

387
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:51,355
Oh.

388
00:33:51,357 --> 00:33:54,558
All right.
Just give me a second.

389
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,959
I might have
to get her up to speed.

390
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:58,862
You can't hear shit
inside this thing.

391
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:04,668
Sash.

392
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,070
You're not gonna believe
this crap.

393
00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:18,849
It felt real.

394
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,218
It felt real.

395
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,393
Like we lost this.

396
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:33,897
And this just started.

397
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:07,464
C'mon.
Wait.

398
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:11,273
I like the way
you call bullshit.

399
00:35:13,116 --> 00:35:16,050
So let me return the favor.

400
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:18,653
The next thing
you're gonna tell me

401
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:21,723
is that you'll go
and that I can stay.

402
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:24,359
Because I know you didn't like
hearing yourself just say

403
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:28,229
that, "Maggie's gotta
take care of Maggie."

404
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:29,897
I know those words
are gonna choke in your ears

405
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:31,432
a good, long while

406
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:33,868
and you're gonna wanna make up
for even thinking that.

407
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,305
Am I right?

408
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:42,577
Yeah.

409
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:45,313
We lay our big meaties
across the chopping block

410
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:48,449
ahead of someone else's.

411
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:52,286
It's always for someone else.

412
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,188
Both of us know,
if we're gonna kick,

413
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,157
there sure as hell better be
a point to it.

414
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:02,764
So maybe we feel there was
a-a point to all of this.

415
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:05,833
Alpha to omega.

416
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:08,269
Whether it's
on the battlefield or the beach

417
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:13,141
or somewhere out there today.

418
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:16,778
Maggie --

419
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,613
She's carrying the future.

420
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:29,857
You're right.

421
00:36:32,595 --> 00:36:37,031
I knew how this was gonna end.

422
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:39,467
C'mon.

423
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:44,138
Layin' your ass
on the line for someone else,

424
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,276
tearin' it to shreds
for 'em --

425
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:50,545
You said it before.

426
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:55,149
Oh, my, that is living.

427
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,655
You're an idiot.

428
00:37:00,657 --> 00:37:03,858
I never said otherwise.

429
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,513
A couple hours
to get there, right?

430
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:26,881
At least.

431
00:37:26,883 --> 00:37:30,017
Might be a circuitous
and janky route.

432
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,252
With what they're planning,

433
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:33,054
they could be watching
the roads.

434
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,756
"What they're planning."

435
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:35,923
That's right.

436
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:40,361
Got it in the marketplace.
It's chock-full.

437
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:43,164
Doubt conversation will be
on tap for the commute.

438
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,166
And though
I am a selfish coward,

439
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:48,069
I do tend to think
of other people on occasion.

440
00:37:48,071 --> 00:37:51,506
Please take it
with my compliments.

441
00:37:51,508 --> 00:37:53,808
I truly wish I measured up.

442
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:59,947
You still can, Eugene.

443
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:03,584
I'm not giving up.

444
00:38:03,586 --> 00:38:05,019
Not on you.

445
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:12,693
Jesus, you don't have to take
the trip in the thing.

446
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:15,062
I could use the rest.

447
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:16,597
No shit?

448
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,366
Yeah.

449
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,736
I just want to go to sleep.

450
00:38:21,738 --> 00:38:24,038
I just need a little bottle
of water, and I'm fine.

451
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,309
Arat?

452
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:32,547
Listen...

453
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:36,083
I know how tough this is.

454
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:38,152
And I appreciate it.

455
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:55,069
Damn, you are something else.

456
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:38,346
♪ Hang on to the world ♪

457
00:39:38,348 --> 00:39:43,351
♪ As it spins around ♪

458
00:39:44,821 --> 00:39:48,656
♪ Just don't let ♪

459
00:39:48,658 --> 00:39:56,397

460
00:39:56,399 --> 00:40:00,067
♪ Things are moving fast ♪

461
00:40:01,337 --> 00:40:03,671
Sash.

462
00:40:03,673 --> 00:40:05,840
You're not gonna believe
this crap.

463
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:09,443
Holy goddamn!

464
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:47,381
Go! Go!

465
00:40:54,257 --> 00:40:56,691
No.

466
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:00,795
Aah!

467
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:04,298
Honey, God damn it!

468
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:20,448
Plan "B" it is!

469
00:41:21,884 --> 00:41:23,818
Down. Now.

470
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,788
We can make another deal.

471
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,090
Aah!

472
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:34,095
Aah!

473
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:37,064
Said "down."

474
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:38,075
Move.

475
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:50,354
Hello again.

476
00:43:04,237 --> 00:43:05,970
Aah!

477
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:17,882
Down.
Or again.

478
00:43:23,248 --> 00:43:26,257
Well, shit, Rick.

479
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,374
You just couldn't
stick with us, huh?

480
00:43:28,376 --> 00:43:33,178
You had to go with
these filthy garbage people?

481
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,047
No offense.

482
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:39,184
Deal is for 12, yes?

483
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:41,654
10.

484
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:43,622
People are a resource.

485
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,357
12.

486
00:43:53,701 --> 00:43:54,967
10.

487
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:05,077
Rick.

488
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:08,514
This is just gonna make you sad.

489
00:44:08,516 --> 00:44:10,282
Broken.

490
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:14,553
You're gonna wish you were dead.

491
00:44:16,957 --> 00:44:19,692
I like having fun.

492
00:44:19,694 --> 00:44:21,860
I do.

493
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:24,096
But maybe you think
that the guy that did

494
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:27,132
what he did
to your friends wasn't me,

495
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:29,868
like that was some sort
of a put-on,

496
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,937
like I'm not
the guy with the bat --

497
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:34,707
I'm just the guy that makes
your kid spaghetti.

498
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:38,644
Oh.

499
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:41,447
Oh, shit.

500
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:42,915
Maybe this is on me.

501
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:46,485
Maybe this is all on me.

502
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:51,924
I gotta make it right.

503
00:44:51,926 --> 00:44:55,794
I guess I gotta start
all over again.

504
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:58,430
I gotta tell you, Rick,

505
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:00,899
if I had a kid,

506
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:04,837
I'd want him
to be just like your kid,

507
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:08,107
which makes this so much harder.

508
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:10,342
You're not gonna win.

509
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:13,112
Carl.

510
00:45:13,114 --> 00:45:15,647
It is over.

511
00:45:15,649 --> 00:45:17,182
Why don't you point
your one ball

512
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:22,621
up the street there
and take it all in?

513
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:28,927
We'll win!

514
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:32,664
We live!

515
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:36,468
We're the ones!

516
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,538
Us!

517
00:45:56,857 --> 00:45:59,691
Ohh.

518
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:01,493
Oh.

519
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:07,232
Wow.

520
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:10,202
You just lost
somebody important to you

521
00:46:10,204 --> 00:46:13,505
right now --
like, just now.

522
00:46:13,507 --> 00:46:15,808
Jesus.

523
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:22,314
That is timing.

524
00:46:22,316 --> 00:46:25,250
Well, Rick...

525
00:46:25,252 --> 00:46:27,019
you chose this.

526
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:31,190
I truly don't know what more
I could've done to warn you.

527
00:46:31,192 --> 00:46:32,724
And this isn't a warning.

528
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:37,763
This is punishment.

529
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:41,133
I'm gonna kill Carl now.

530
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:46,772
I'm gonna make it
one nice, hard swing,

531
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:52,578
try to do it in one
because I like him.

532
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,279
I just want you
to put that in your brain

533
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:56,348
and roll it around for a minute.

534
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:01,086
I'm gonna kill Carl,
and then Lucille here,

535
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:03,755
she's gonna take your hands.

536
00:47:06,794 --> 00:47:09,628
You can do it
right in front of me.

537
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,499
You can take my hands.

538
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:15,567
I told you already --

539
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:19,137
I'm gonna kill you.

540
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:21,573
All of you.

541
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:26,478
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow...

542
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,048
but nothing is
gonna change that --

543
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:34,052
nothing.

544
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:36,622
You're all already dead.

545
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:57,676
Damn.

546
00:47:57,678 --> 00:48:00,112
Wow, Rick.

547
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:06,318
Okay.

548
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:13,792
You said I could do it.

549
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:28,473
End these Saviors
and their accomplices!

550
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:32,210
Alexandria will not fall,
not on this day!

551
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:45,891
Aah!

552
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:48,193
Phalanx out, third group, now!

553
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:50,195
Move up!
Now we got your backs!

554
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:02,874
A goddamn tiger!

555
00:49:14,521 --> 00:49:17,889
That widow is alive,
guns a-blazin'!

556
00:49:19,426 --> 00:49:22,561
You taste that, Simon?
That is the taste of shit!

557
00:50:38,848 --> 00:50:40,448
They're falling back.

558
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:42,450
Eduardo, Bertie,
between the houses --

559
00:50:42,452 --> 00:50:43,751
Cover the gate!

560
00:50:45,188 --> 00:50:48,923
Let's go.

561
00:50:48,925 --> 00:50:51,025
Now we finish this!

562
00:51:53,723 --> 00:51:54,956
Now!

563
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:01,862
Pull!

564
00:53:02,892 --> 00:53:06,861
Michonne.

565
00:53:06,863 --> 00:53:10,431
Michonne.

566
00:53:10,433 --> 00:53:12,633
Oh, you're alive.

567
00:53:28,184 --> 00:53:33,954
We -- W-We're...

568
00:53:33,956 --> 00:53:35,189
We're...

569
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:37,625
I know. I know.

570
00:53:37,627 --> 00:53:41,128
I know.

571
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:45,461
We are.

572
00:53:45,581 --> 00:53:47,490
We will.

573
00:54:08,565 --> 00:54:11,299
Getting preparations in place.

574
00:54:11,642 --> 00:54:14,488
Everyone's
on "blue level."

575
00:54:14,682 --> 00:54:17,716
You say the word,
they're ready to go.

576
00:54:17,718 --> 00:54:19,518
That's good.

577
00:54:31,232 --> 00:54:38,070
How the hell do you think
she wound up dead in that box?

578
00:54:38,072 --> 00:54:41,707
My, um, best possible posit
fingers the tarp.

579
00:54:41,709 --> 00:54:46,111
That sealed up said box
good and tight.

580
00:54:46,113 --> 00:54:48,380
She ran out of air.

581
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:06,565
Maybe.

582
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:21,680
So...

583
00:55:27,488 --> 00:55:29,822
we are going to war!

584
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:32,958
Yes, sir!

585
00:55:43,137 --> 00:55:47,973
Do you think
Sasha did that herself?

586
00:55:47,975 --> 00:55:50,943
I don't know how,
but I know she did.

587
00:55:56,884 --> 00:56:00,219
She gave us a chance.
You did.

588
00:56:00,221 --> 00:56:03,989
You made
the right decision to come.

589
00:56:03,991 --> 00:56:08,894
The decision was made
a long time ago,

590
00:56:08,896 --> 00:56:12,731
before any of us knew
each other,

591
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:14,333
when we were all strangers
who would have

592
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,868
just passed each other
on the street

593
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:20,372
before the world ended.

594
00:56:20,374 --> 00:56:22,908
And now we mean everything
to each other.

595
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:05,918
You were in trouble.
You were trapped.

596
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,188
Glenn didn't know you,
but he helped you.

597
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:15,027
He put himself in danger
for you.

598
00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:18,864
And that started it all --

599
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:23,369
From Atlanta,
to my daddy's farm,

600
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:25,771
to the prison,

601
00:57:25,773 --> 00:57:28,374
to here...

602
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:41,887
to this moment now...

603
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:45,758
not as strangers --

604
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
as family...

605
00:58:20,494 --> 00:58:25,964
because Glenn chose
to be there for you that day

606
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:28,867
a long time ago.

607
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:32,104
That was the decision
that changed everything.

608
00:58:40,714 --> 00:58:43,048
It started with both of you,

609
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,518
and it just grew...

610
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,890
to all of us...

611
00:58:51,892 --> 00:58:57,062
to sacrifice for each other...

612
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:11,977
to suffer and stand,

613
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:16,982
to grieve, to give,

614
00:59:16,984 --> 00:59:23,222
to love, to live...

615
00:59:23,224 --> 00:59:25,357
to fight for each other.

616
00:59:30,498 --> 00:59:34,933
Glenn made the decision, Rick.

617
00:59:34,935 --> 00:59:38,070
I was just following his lead.

618
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:50,127
