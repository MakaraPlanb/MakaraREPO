1
00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:03,363
Previously, on AMC's
"The Walking Dead"...

2
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:05,531
I only want Negan.

3
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:07,000
A single bullet ain't gonna do it.

4
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:08,868
Best case, maybe you take him out.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,636
Then make me a bullet.

6
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:13,039
Everything we have,
we got from fighting.

7
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:16,209
We play by their rules,
we get some kinda life.

8
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:17,910
You led us all to the promise land,

9
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:19,545
isn't that right, Rick?

10
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:21,314
He we are!

11
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,850
Oh, I like it here.

12
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:25,618
Saviors can actually
be quite reasonable.

13
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:32,185
Maggie.

14
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:36,422
Uh.

15
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:39,292
I know people
are saying things --

16
00:01:39,294 --> 00:01:43,262
nice things about you and Sasha, hmm?

17
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,899
They are?

18
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,434
They are.

19
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:50,970
About the other night...

20
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:55,541
about how they're thinking
you saved the place.

21
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:57,810
Don't let it go to your head.

22
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:03,116
Well, don't let it bother you.

23
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:04,884
It seems like it bothers you.

24
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:07,954
Mm.

25
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,130
What you doing up there?

26
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:21,701
You gonna eat that?

27
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:24,303
Yes.

28
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:27,240
Dude.

29
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:29,142
You know she's pregnant.

30
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:58,337
Against the grain, kid.

31
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:02,308
Always against the grain.

32
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:40,213
Ah.

33
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:41,948
Damn, that smells good.

34
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,252
Mmm!

35
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:49,988
Want a taste?

36
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:55,826
Okay.

37
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:08,165
Here's his damn lemonade.

38
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,967
I had some in my kitchen.

39
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,937
Denise liked it.

40
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:21,779
Thank you.

41
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:22,880
Hey.

42
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:26,884
Go home.

43
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:28,685
Let me take over.

44
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,356
No.

45
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:35,359
I'm fine.

46
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:39,396
I told Rick I would watch Judith.

47
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:40,898
I'm gonna do that.

48
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:48,105
You should go.

49
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,341
We're about to sit.

50
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:21,405
We're gonna need another setting.

51
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:50,534
Today and only today, right?

52
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,269
Yeah.

53
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:58,642
All these bullet holes --

54
00:05:58,644 --> 00:06:01,211
this'll take on water quick.

55
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:09,319
We can probably make it to the canoe.

56
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:10,854
Probably.

57
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:14,825
If you want to stay back...

58
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,662
I'm going to pretend
you didn't just say that.

59
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:36,346
I'm seeing this through.

60
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:37,348
We both are.

61
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:05,342
I'm not waiting for your dad anymore.

62
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:09,012
I don't know where the hell he is,

63
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:10,881
but Lucille...

64
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:16,520
...is hungry.

65
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:25,395
Carl, pass the rolls...

66
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:30,934
...Please.

67
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:11,157

68
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,308
Ohh. Look at that, huh?

69
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,443
Easy as that.

70
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:34,813
It's just a transaction.

71
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,582
You look like shit,

72
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,883
which means you fought for this.

73
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,351
You did your jobs.

74
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:43,188
You get it, and I like that.

75
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,190
Negan likes that.

76
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,629
That's...good to hear.

77
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,632
You play your cards right,

78
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:56,835
maybe I'll show you where we live.

79
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,604
Maybe I'll buy you a sandwich.

80
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,047
Just tell me when.

81
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,049
You like watching, haircut?

82
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,051
Yes.

83
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,686
I mean...

84
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,723
You mean to get the hell out of here.

85
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:18,924
Now!

86
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,830
Morgan.

87
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,835
It's just some things
from the Kingdom garden --

88
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:05,871
some nectarines, some apples.

89
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,940
Thank you. I am good.

90
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,408
You can fend for yourself, I know,

91
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,844
but fresh produce isn't
something you can just --

92
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:12,846
Really.

93
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,014
I'm good.

94
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:21,286
Ezekiel?

95
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,188
Apparently, some people are
having a hard time believing me

96
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,958
when I say I just want
to be left alone.

97
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,361
You know, I was trying
to leave you alone, and I will.

98
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,664
But you called me over.

99
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,799
Why?

100
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,067
How are you?

101
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,603
Good.

102
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:38,937
Good.

103
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,272
Now you can go.

104
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,410
I think you're going soft.

105
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,112
I think you're going.

106
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:55,320
Hey.
‭Hi.

107
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,123
Carol, hi.

108
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,292
I'm sorry to bother you.

109
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:02,928
Morgan, I-I didn't expect you
to be here, too.

110
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,497
It's good you are.

111
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,165
I wanted to speak to you both,
actually.

112
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,734
It's about something important.

113
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:17,109
Almost at the canoe.

114
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,679
We're taking on water quick, man.

115
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,813
I know.

116
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:32,958
Rick, on the left!

117
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,624
We're almost there.

118
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,337
‭Whoa!

119
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,038
Whoa! Whoa!

120
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:23,976
No, no!

121
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,179
Oh!

122
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,184
Hold on!

123
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,752
Hold on!

124
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,087
Stay in the canoe!

125
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,623
I can -- Just --

126
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,024
Oh!

127
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,126
Aaron!

128
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,928
Aaron!

129
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,270
Aaron!

130
00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:59,645
I'm okay.

131
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:01,513
I'm all right.

132
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,183
I'm okay.

133
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,518
I'm okay.

134
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,419
Stop hugging the wall.

135
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,286
Watch it!

136
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:47,125
God damn it!

137
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,030
Go get a mop and another barrel.

138
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,932
We're keeping this crap?

139
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,301
We don't have to eat it.

140
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,103
Jesus. He hates pickles.

141
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,847
It's got hooks.

142
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,615
I don't know why
he didn't strap it in.

143
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,151
Told him twice.
His stupid ass didn't listen.

144
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,456
Mm.

145
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,211
Okay.

146
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,720
Bit of a sore loser.

147
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,056
Huh.

148
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,525
Looks like the only thing
he ran out of was ammo.

149
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,062
We got to get this back now.

150
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,130
Yeah.

151
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:03,335
Well...he's got paddles.

152
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:04,870
And with the wind picking up,

153
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,472
it shouldn't take long
to drift back to shore.

154
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:11,042
Easy. Easy.

155
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,111
We got it.
Take this crap back.

156
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,013
How 'bout, this time,
you watch where you're going?

157
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,150
Oh, come on.
Get off his back.

158
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:37,169
You know, back there,

159
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:41,540
I didn't mean
that you couldn't do it.

160
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:45,210
It's just...

161
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,213
going this far, risking this much

162
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,514
to get things for them --

163
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,516
people don't agree with it.

164
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,618
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.

165
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,459
I was there.

166
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:06,131
I saw what happened on the road.

167
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,568
What we're doing is gonna
keep people living.

168
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,937
We get to do that,

169
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,940
it doesn't matter what happens to us.

170
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,075
Michonne doesn't think
this is living.

171
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:23,648
Well, committing to
a choice like this,

172
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,385
after living how we did --
free --

173
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,486
I get it.

174
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,991
It's hard.

175
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,259
It's giving up everything,

176
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:39,564
right up until your own life.

177
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:43,435
But either your heart's beating,
or it isn't.

178
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,477
Your loved ones' hearts
are beating, or they aren't.

179
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,750
We take what they give us
so that we can live.

180
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:30,220
So, how long you been with Negan?

181
00:17:36,963 --> 00:17:38,696
Why were you out there alone?

182
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:42,634
Tell me.

183
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:57,982
You think talking won't change
how this ends for you.

184
00:17:57,984 --> 00:18:00,284
But you don't know me.

185
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:06,223
Let's see what happens.

186
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:26,844
I'm not gonna kill him today.

187
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:29,780
I'm gonna find the way that we win.

188
00:18:32,952 --> 00:18:35,285
I'm gonna change
how this ends for me.

189
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:39,490
That's why I'm out here alone.

190
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:52,002
Is that an apple pie?

191
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:53,670
Uh.
How did you do that?

192
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:55,472
I could smell it
from outside the door.

193
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:58,208
Uh, you baked it?

194
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,645
Some guy gave it to us for what we did.
‭Mm.

195
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:03,947
His little girl said you should
run for President of Hilltop.

196
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:06,417
"Maggie for President."

197
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:14,691
Uh, do you want a plate?

198
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:16,660
No, I'm good.

199
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:20,297
Did Jesus give you those?

200
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,567
Is he still around?

201
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,469
There's some things
I wanna add to his list

202
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:28,072
before he goes out.

203
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:30,974
The kids need something
to write with -- pens, pencils.

204
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:32,342
Are you already president?

205
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:33,577
Mm.

206
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,812
I've just been talking to people.

207
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:37,381
Jesus left this morning.

208
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:40,084
He told me to tell you,
but I-I forgot.

209
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:43,153
Okay. Next time.

210
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:44,388
I'm gonna get some milk.

211
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,056
Let me.
No, I'm good.

212
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,766
What?

213
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:58,869
You're lying to Maggie about Jesus.

214
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:03,540
What makes you say that?

215
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,275
A girl who lives in the house.

216
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:06,910
She was telling me about everyone.

217
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:08,145
She said Jesus is a runner

218
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:10,280
and that he left yesterday,

219
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:11,682
not this morning.

220
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:16,520
It's for her own good.
‭Why?

221
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:19,256
Because I need to do something,

222
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:20,757
and she'll want to help me.

223
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:24,761
You want to kill Negan.

224
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,269
What if you have help?

225
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:34,404
If we had help --
a lot of people --

226
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:36,640
then I wouldn't be afraid
to tell her,

227
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:39,209
because she'd know
it wasn't on her to do it.

228
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:42,045
But if it's just me, then --
‭It isn't just you.

229
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,480
You and Maggie aren't the only ones

230
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:44,715
who want to take Negan out.

231
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:45,649
There's --
‭No, Enid.

232
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:46,850
That's not happening.

233
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:48,085
And if you care about her,

234
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:49,453
you don't say anything about this.

235
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:53,490
We have to keep her safe.

236
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:57,427
You have to keep her safe.

237
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:02,199
It isn't just you.

238
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:09,473
It sure looks like it.

239
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:12,142
A lot of places came
together after the world fell apart.

240
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:17,281
Maybe you're both
from one of those places.

241
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:22,853
Most of those communities
and camps are gone now.

242
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:24,788
I lost people.

243
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,927
I pretty much lost hope in people.

244
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,496
But then I found the Kingdom.

245
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:35,966
I met Ezekiel.

246
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:37,467
I saw what he built.

247
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:40,270
But now I believe
what he built is under threat.

248
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:41,538
The Saviors.

249
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,509
The Saviors.

250
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:47,144
A few months back,

251
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:50,547
Ezekiel and a few guards met
a group of them in the woods.

252
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:53,150
The Saviors recognized
Ezekiel's capabilities,

253
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:55,152
and Ezekiel didn't want to fight,

254
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:56,453
so they cut a deal.

255
00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:58,555
In exchange for food and supplies,

256
00:21:58,557 --> 00:22:00,023
no one would get hurt,

257
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:02,693
and they'd never set foot
inside the Kingdom,

258
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:04,828
and very few of us even know.

259
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,030
What does any of this
have to do with me?

260
00:22:07,032 --> 00:22:08,932
I know Ezekiel likes you.

261
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:11,768
I also know that Ezekiel trusts you,

262
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,303
and that's why I'm here.

263
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:16,173
I need you to help me
convince him of something.

264
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:18,742
Right now,
we have peace with the Saviors,

265
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:21,245
but sooner or later,
sometimes's gonna go wrong.

266
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:23,480
Maybe we'll be light on a drop,

267
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:26,316
or maybe one of ours will look
at one of theirs the wrong way,

268
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:30,721
or maybe they'll just decide
to stop honoring the deal.

269
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:34,625
Things will go bad.

270
00:22:34,627 --> 00:22:36,059
And when they do...

271
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:41,598
...the Kingdom will fall.

272
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:47,471
I had a family.

273
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:51,174
I lost it to this world.

274
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:54,177
I saw them die.

275
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,382
I'm scared that,
if we don't do something now,

276
00:22:58,384 --> 00:23:01,351
that we won't only lose more people --
We'll lose everything.

277
00:23:01,353 --> 00:23:04,721
I know what the Saviors are,
and I know what they do.

278
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:08,058
And I know they cannot be trusted.

279
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:12,863
And I think you know that, too.

280
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:17,567
What exactly are you asking?

281
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:22,472
I'm asking you
to help convince Ezekiel

282
00:23:22,474 --> 00:23:25,542
to attack the Saviors,
to strike first...

283
00:23:25,544 --> 00:23:26,743
and destroy them.

284
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:37,365
Is that for you...

285
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:39,234
or Negan?

286
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:43,905
It's for him.

287
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:48,276
How will you do it?

288
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:51,579
I'll pull the trigger.

289
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:53,281
They'll kill you.

290
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:56,885
As long as he goes first.

291
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:59,721
Why do you have to die?

292
00:23:59,723 --> 00:24:01,890
Because he has to.

293
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,264
I agree.

294
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,598
But...

295
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:17,572
...Why do you?

296
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:22,644
There's, uh...

297
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:28,450
...No need
to lie to me if...

298
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:31,519
this is our last conversation.

299
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:41,496
If Abraham was alive, we could fight.

300
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:44,799
If Glenn was,

301
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:50,371
Maggie's kid would have a father.

302
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:54,209
Michonne and Carl can fight.

303
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:57,212
They have Rick.

304
00:24:57,214 --> 00:25:01,149
Aaron has Eric.

305
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:05,153
Eugene knows things.

306
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:07,489
Daryl's strong.

307
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:11,693
What about Sasha?

308
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:27,408
Look at me, Rosita.

309
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:35,683
It shouldn't have been you.

310
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:41,856
It shouldn't have been anyone.

311
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:44,225
We'll win,

312
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:47,529
but we need to wait
for the right moment

313
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:50,532
or create it...

314
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:53,468
together.

315
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,204
And you're a part of that together.

316
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:01,442
Don't do this.

317
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:07,916
We need you.

318
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:50,425
♪ It's the sweetest disease
and ♪

319
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:53,328
♪ On it, you will rely ♪

320
00:26:54,865 --> 00:27:00,101
♪ It's the art of believin' ♪

321
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,042
Okay.
I know there's a lot of them.

322
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,845
I'm guessing a good deal more
than we have at the Kingdom.

323
00:27:10,847 --> 00:27:13,248
The element of surprise
is our only hope.

324
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,449
We need to attack first,

325
00:27:14,451 --> 00:27:15,750
and we need to do it now

326
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:17,452
while we still have the advantage.

327
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:22,790
Carol, I imagine
that violence and fighting

328
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,659
is something
you haven't been a part of.

329
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,262
You're wrong.

330
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:28,963
You're very wrong.

331
00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:31,699
She's probably the most capable
fighter in this room.

332
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:33,768
Then it's time to fight.

333
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:37,372
No.

334
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:40,174
This is something I am not a part of.

335
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:41,609
Then you don't have to fight.

336
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:43,411
You just have to convince Ezekiel

337
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,013
to bring the Kingdom to fight.

338
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:47,115
You're not understanding me.

339
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:48,616
I didn't want you.

340
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:50,685
I didn't want Ezekiel
or Morgan coming here.

341
00:27:50,687 --> 00:27:53,221
And I don't want anything
to do with your lives

342
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:55,323
or your deaths.

343
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,692
I just want to be left alone.

344
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:06,701
People will die --
a lot of them.

345
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,469
You killed a man.

346
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:10,338
I took a life to save a life.

347
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,640
It's the same goddamn thing.

348
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:14,742
We'll be taking their lives
to save ours!

349
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:16,344
Only you don't know that it will.

350
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:18,913
You're gonna choose
to kill one day, Morgan,

351
00:28:18,915 --> 00:28:20,915
'cause it will get that bad!

352
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,653
Why not choose now,

353
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:27,722
before you lose
someone you care about?

354
00:28:27,724 --> 00:28:29,223
There's a peace now.

355
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:31,693
I won't be a part of changing that.

356
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:33,728
And maybe we can build on that.

357
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,063
Not with these people!

358
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:37,165
When they turn on us --
and they will --

359
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,500
that blood is gonna be on your hands!

360
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,542
But maybe you're both used to that.

361
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,348
You should go, too.

362
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,416
I should.

363
00:28:57,554 --> 00:29:00,788
I don't want anyone else
coming around

364
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,623
or even knowing where I am.

365
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,859
If you somehow see anyone we know,

366
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:06,794
tell them I'm gone.

367
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:08,463
Do that for me please.

368
00:29:08,465 --> 00:29:10,198
Never meant for you to see me.

369
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,546
Hi.

370
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,516
Hi.

371
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,554
Hi.

372
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,739
Hot date?

373
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,345
I'm on a good momentum with them.

374
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:40,713
Gonna try to use that.

375
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,281
Yeah? How?

376
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,188
By trying to get closer,
even just to start trying.

377
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,857
If I can do that,
after a while --

378
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:52,191
maybe months, maybe years --

379
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:54,527
maybe then we try something.

380
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:59,165
I think it's what my mom
would have done,

381
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,500
so it's what I'm gonna do.

382
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,303
Okay.

383
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:11,043
Whatever it was...

384
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:13,679
I thought
we had something good --

385
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,048
at least, the beginning
of something good.

386
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,484
Why'd you end it?

387
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:21,287
Why'd you even start it?

388
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,000
I was trying not to think about shit.

389
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:33,499
You're cute, tall.

390
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:37,203
You're sweet sometimes.

391
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,471
So I used you.

392
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:48,281
I'm sorry.

393
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,489
Would you be up for dinner later?

394
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:58,491
I really mean just dinner.

395
00:32:58,493 --> 00:32:59,825
‭No strings.

396
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:05,731
All right.

397
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,900
All right.

398
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:30,389
What the hell?

399
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:37,196
Whoa. Whoa.

400
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:41,567
It's cool, I swear.

401
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:44,403
Buddy, you can walk right out
that back gate there,

402
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:47,807
and I won't say anything to anybody.

403
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,942
I'm supposed to be there now,

404
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,979
but, listen, I'm --
I'm just trying to get by,

405
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:56,782
just like you.

406
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,417
Please.

407
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:01,120
Daryl.

408
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:13,232
Daryl.

409
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:33,085
It ain't just about gettin' by here.

410
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:34,954
It's about gettin' it all.

411
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,592
I got the key.
Let's go.

412
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,429
No. ‭I just
want to talk to him.

413
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:44,664
I said "no."

414
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,133
Dot be an asshole, Arat.

415
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,235
Let the man pass.

416
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,111
Oh, crap.
Is that for me?

417
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:02,114
We haven't officially met.

418
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:05,851
I'm Spencer Monroe.

419
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,853
Hi.

420
00:35:19,545 --> 00:35:20,644
That's Negan.

421
00:35:33,492 --> 00:35:36,393
Is he down there?

422
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,661
Yeah.

423
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:40,330
We're all Negan.

424
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:44,768
Whatever you're trying to do,
you can't.

425
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:48,839
But you still have some choices.

426
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:50,907
Go home.

427
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:54,411
Burn this car,
roll it down into a lake,

428
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:56,279
make it disappear.

429
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:59,783
There's a silencer
in the glove compartment.

430
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:04,314
Where is he?

431
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:06,116
Negan?

432
00:37:06,118 --> 00:37:09,653
He's in your house, asshole,
waiting for you.

433
00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:19,463
Whoa, hey.

434
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:20,764
Just like that?

435
00:37:20,766 --> 00:37:23,366
See, we've been waiting for hours

436
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:27,137
just to see what
you gonna bring us, huh?

437
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:29,473
Why don't we have a look first?

438
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:37,013
Running water, air conditioning,

439
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:38,849
a housewarming gift?

440
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:40,383
That settles it.

441
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:44,221
I am getting myself
a vacation home here.

442
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:46,223
Cheers to that.

443
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:48,859
Mm.

444
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:52,796
Mmm.

445
00:37:52,798 --> 00:37:56,032
Oh, that is good.

446
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:58,902
You know, the only thing missing
is a pool table.

447
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:03,707
Nothing better
than a good game of 8 ball.

448
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:06,143
The house across the street
has one in the garage.

449
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:09,613
Oh, Spencer,

450
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:12,482
you may just be my new best friend.

451
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:16,219
Such a nice day, though --

452
00:38:16,221 --> 00:38:17,554
too nice to be cooped up

453
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:21,057
inside some garage, don't you think?

454
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:22,726
Yeah.

455
00:38:22,728 --> 00:38:24,995
Oh, I got a better idea.

456
00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:35,939
Not bad.

457
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:40,010
We had to go out pretty far.

458
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:42,679
What the hell's this?

459
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:45,382
"Congrats for winning.
But you still lose"?

460
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:53,290
You leave us a little love note?

461
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:56,193
No, I just --

462
00:38:56,195 --> 00:39:00,130
I mean --
We wouldn't, obviously --

463
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,298
Wait. What?

464
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,066
Did you just say it's obvious?

465
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:04,068
Ohh!

466
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:08,138
We didn't do that.

467
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,640
It's not about the damn note!

468
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,809
Hey. Don't.

469
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,945
Run along to Negan, Rick.

470
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:21,117
Ohh!

471
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:27,123
But your friend here --
he's got no place to be.

472
00:39:28,126 --> 00:39:29,426
You --
‭Back up!

473
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:34,331
I could never do this with Rick.

474
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,667
He would just be standing there,
scowling,

475
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:41,638
giving me that annoying side-eye
he gives me.

476
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,642
That's actually
what I came to see you about.

477
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:47,143
I want to talk to you about Rick.

478
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:54,651
All right.

479
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:56,586
Talk to me, Spencer.

480
00:39:56,588 --> 00:39:58,521
Talk to me about Rick.

481
00:40:06,398 --> 00:40:10,033
I get what you're trying to do here,

482
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:11,601
what you're trying to build.

483
00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:14,037
I'm not saying I agree
with your methods,

484
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,205
but I get it.

485
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,873
You're building a network.

486
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,110
You're making people contribute
for the greater good.

487
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:22,979
It makes sense.

488
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:26,016
But you should know that Rick Grimes

489
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:28,685
has a history of not
working well with others.

490
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:31,354
Mm.

491
00:40:32,658 --> 00:40:34,190
Is that so?

492
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:39,763
Rick wasn't the original leader here.

493
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:41,398
My mom was.

494
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,668
She was doing
a really good job of it.

495
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,905
Then she died,
not long after Rick showed up --

496
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,474
same with my brother,
same with my dad.

497
00:40:51,476 --> 00:40:55,912
So, everything was peachy here
for -- what -- years?

498
00:40:55,914 --> 00:41:00,917
And then Rick shows up,
and suddenly, you're an orphan?

499
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:05,088
That is the saddest story
I've ever heard.

500
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,659
Good thing for you ‭he's not in
charge anymore. Doesn't matter.

501
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:11,494
His ego's out of control.

502
00:41:11,496 --> 00:41:14,264
He'll find a way to screw things up,

503
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:17,500
to try and do things his way,
to take over.

504
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:19,936
That's what he did with my mom.

505
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,237
That's what he'll do again.

506
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,749
What exactly are you proposing
be done about that?

507
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:36,753
I am my mother's son.

508
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:40,423
I can be the leader she was.

509
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:41,758
That's what this place needs.

510
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,059
That's what you need.

511
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:48,064
So I should
put you in charge --

512
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:49,399
that's what you're saying?

513
00:41:50,435 --> 00:41:52,535
We'd be much better off.

514
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:58,141
You're all right.
You're all right.

515
00:42:00,278 --> 00:42:02,045
All right, all right, all right.

516
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:03,279
Point made.

517
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:16,159
My heart's still beating, right?

518
00:42:20,932 --> 00:42:24,467
You know, I'm thinking, Spencer.

519
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:27,804
I'm thinking
how Rick threatened to kill me,

520
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:31,207
how he clearly hates my guts.

521
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:34,444
But he is out there right now,

522
00:42:34,446 --> 00:42:37,247
gathering shit for me to make sure

523
00:42:37,249 --> 00:42:42,118
I don't hurt any of
the fine people that live here.

524
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,255
He is swallowing his hate

525
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:50,160
and getting shit done.

526
00:42:50,162 --> 00:42:51,895
That takes guts.

527
00:42:59,471 --> 00:43:01,504
And then there's you...

528
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:06,342
...The guy who waited
for Rick to be gone

529
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:08,611
so he could sneak over and talk to me

530
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:10,413
to get me to do his dirty work,

531
00:43:10,415 --> 00:43:13,149
so he could take Rick's place.

532
00:43:13,151 --> 00:43:15,051
So I got to ask --

533
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:18,521
if you wanna take over,

534
00:43:18,523 --> 00:43:20,890
why not just kill Rick yourself

535
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:23,560
and just take over?

536
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:24,461
What? No, no.

537
00:43:24,463 --> 00:43:25,628
I didn't -- I don't --

538
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,363
You know what I'm thinking?

539
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:32,569
'Cause I have a guess.

540
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:36,473
It's because you got no guts.

541
00:43:43,515 --> 00:43:45,381
Ohh!

542
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:02,165
Ohh. How embarrassing.

543
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:04,534
There they are.

544
00:44:04,536 --> 00:44:06,402
They were inside you the whole time.

545
00:44:06,404 --> 00:44:07,704
You did have guts.

546
00:44:07,706 --> 00:44:11,674
I've never been so wrong
in my whole life!

547
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:37,700
Now, someone oughta get up here
and clean this mess up.

548
00:44:42,574 --> 00:44:44,240
Oh.

549
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,747
Anyone want to finish the game?

550
00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:52,115
C'mon.

551
00:44:53,785 --> 00:44:56,085
Anybody?

552
00:44:57,389 --> 00:44:59,289
Anybody?

553
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:03,459
C'mon.

554
00:45:03,461 --> 00:45:04,994
I was winning!

555
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:18,858
Shit!

556
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,227
What the shit?!

557
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:24,831
Shit! You just --
You tried to kill me?!

558
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,432
You shot Lucille!

559
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:27,967
She got in the way.

560
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:42,582
What is this?

561
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:47,554
What is this?

562
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:50,557
This little bad boy
made from scratch?

563
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,393
Look at those crimps.

564
00:45:53,395 --> 00:45:56,062
This was homemade.

565
00:45:56,064 --> 00:45:58,264
You may be stupid, darlin',

566
00:45:58,266 --> 00:46:03,269
but you showed
some real ingenuity here.

567
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:10,209
Arat, move that knife up
out on that girl's face.

568
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,248
Lucille's beautiful, smooth surface

569
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,050
is never gonna look the same,

570
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:18,551
so why should yours?!

571
00:46:21,056 --> 00:46:22,056
Unless...

572
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:29,429
Unless you tell me who made this.

573
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:31,931
It was me.

574
00:46:31,933 --> 00:46:33,733
I made it.

575
00:46:33,735 --> 00:46:38,237
You see, now I just think
you're lying.

576
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,040
And you lying to me now?!

577
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:45,979
Such a shame.

578
00:46:45,981 --> 00:46:48,815
Arat's gonna have to cut up
that pretty face.

579
00:46:50,218 --> 00:46:51,918
One more try.

580
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,753
It was me.

581
00:46:55,657 --> 00:46:56,823
Oh!

582
00:46:56,825 --> 00:46:59,759
You are such a badass!

583
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:03,863
Fine.

584
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:07,834
Have it your way.

585
00:47:07,836 --> 00:47:08,836
Arat...

586
00:47:10,105 --> 00:47:11,571
Kill somebody.

587
00:47:13,174 --> 00:47:15,341
No. It was me!

588
00:47:15,343 --> 00:47:16,576
No!

589
00:47:16,578 --> 00:47:17,777
Ohh!

590
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:38,331
We had an agreement.

591
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,499
Rick!

592
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:42,602
Look, everybody, it's Rick.

593
00:47:42,604 --> 00:47:45,338
Ah, your people are making me
lose my voice

594
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,606
doin' all this yelling.

595
00:47:47,709 --> 00:47:51,177
Rick...
how about a "thank you"?

596
00:47:53,848 --> 00:47:57,850
I mean, look, I know
we started this relationship

597
00:47:57,852 --> 00:48:01,354
with me beating the holy shit
out of your friends,

598
00:48:01,356 --> 00:48:03,556
and because of that,
we're never gonna sit around

599
00:48:03,558 --> 00:48:04,991
and braid each other's hair

600
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:06,659
or share our deepest,
darkest secrets,

601
00:48:06,661 --> 00:48:09,162
but how about a little credit?

602
00:48:09,164 --> 00:48:11,397
I just bent over backwards

603
00:48:11,399 --> 00:48:15,301
to show you how reasonable I am.

604
00:48:15,303 --> 00:48:17,236
Your kid --

605
00:48:17,238 --> 00:48:19,372
he hid in one of my trucks

606
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:22,642
and machine-gunned
a bunch of my men down,

607
00:48:22,644 --> 00:48:26,512
and I brought him home,
safe and sound,

608
00:48:26,514 --> 00:48:29,148
and I fed him spaghetti.

609
00:48:34,055 --> 00:48:37,190
Another one of your people --

610
00:48:37,192 --> 00:48:41,694
well, he wanted me to kill you
and put him in charge.

611
00:48:41,696 --> 00:48:45,498
I took him out...for you.

612
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,235
And another one, here --

613
00:48:49,237 --> 00:48:53,740
she shot Lucille,
trying to kill me just now,

614
00:48:53,742 --> 00:48:55,708
so I gave you one less mouth to feed.

615
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,311
And by looking at her --

616
00:48:58,313 --> 00:49:01,114
that mouth did some major damage.

617
00:49:01,116 --> 00:49:02,715
Now, personally,

618
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:04,584
I wouldn't have picked her
to be the one to go,

619
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:06,219
but Arat --

620
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:07,954
I don't know --
didn't trust her.

621
00:49:17,098 --> 00:49:19,232
Your shit's waiting for you
at the gate.

622
00:49:19,234 --> 00:49:20,533
Just go.

623
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:24,604
Sure thing, Rick...

624
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:28,074
right after I find the guy or gal

625
00:49:28,076 --> 00:49:32,111
that made this bullet.

626
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:33,446
Arat?

627
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:38,651
It was me!

628
00:49:38,653 --> 00:49:41,087
No, it wasn't.

629
00:49:49,497 --> 00:49:51,164
It was me.

630
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:54,801
It was only me.

631
00:49:54,803 --> 00:49:56,836
You?

632
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:03,075
It required one spent casing,
one four-holed turret reloader,

633
00:50:03,077 --> 00:50:05,344
powder,
one funnel for the powder --

634
00:50:05,346 --> 00:50:06,679
Shut up.

635
00:50:08,283 --> 00:50:10,750
I believe you.

636
00:50:23,798 --> 00:50:28,301
Lucille, give me strength.

637
00:50:32,774 --> 00:50:38,678
I'm gonna be relieving you
of your bullet maker, Rick --

638
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,115
that and whatever you
left for me at the front gate.

639
00:50:43,117 --> 00:50:45,852
And however much you scavenged,

640
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:48,020
it's not good enough,

641
00:50:48,022 --> 00:50:52,892
because you're still
in a serious, serious hole

642
00:50:52,894 --> 00:50:54,360
after today.

643
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,899
Let's move out!

644
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,871
No! No, no!

645
00:51:04,873 --> 00:51:06,505
Please, just take me!

646
00:51:06,507 --> 00:51:08,241
No!

647
00:51:08,243 --> 00:51:11,210
Rick, I ain't gonna lie --

648
00:51:11,212 --> 00:51:14,981
your kitchen is a goddamn mess.

649
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:18,417
I'll see you next time.

650
00:52:17,098 --> 00:52:18,965
Carl told me you were in here.

651
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:20,166
I...

652
00:52:46,194 --> 00:52:48,528
I found what I was looking for.

653
00:52:54,169 --> 00:52:58,471
I wanted to go with you and Aaron,

654
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:00,506
but I couldn't.

655
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:04,944
I had to go my way.

656
00:53:04,946 --> 00:53:07,046
But when I found it...

657
00:53:07,048 --> 00:53:12,685
...I realized that...

658
00:53:12,687 --> 00:53:16,889
I didn't want it to be my way.

659
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:21,394
I wanted it to be ours --
me and you.

660
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:31,671
There are more of them,
even more than we thought.

661
00:53:31,673 --> 00:53:36,242
We are outnumbered.
It's not even close.

662
00:53:36,244 --> 00:53:38,578
But that doesn't change
the way that I feel,

663
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,148
because it doesn't change
the way that things are.

664
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,984
We're still alive, Rick.

665
00:53:44,986 --> 00:53:47,186
So much has happened,

666
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:49,555
so much that we shouldn't
have lived through.

667
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:51,023
And...

668
00:53:51,025 --> 00:53:53,993
and in spite of it
or maybe because of it,

669
00:53:53,995 --> 00:53:55,962
we did.

670
00:53:57,398 --> 00:54:02,401
We're still here, the two of us.

671
00:54:02,403 --> 00:54:06,272
We're still standing,
and we're gonna keep standing.

672
00:54:06,274 --> 00:54:10,076
So, what do we do with that?

673
00:54:10,078 --> 00:54:15,047
How do we make that mean something?

674
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:18,184
We're the ones who get things done.

675
00:54:18,186 --> 00:54:21,721
You said that.

676
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:23,789
We're the ones who live.

677
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:32,231
That's why
we have to fight --

678
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:39,105
not for us, but for Judith, for Carl,

679
00:54:39,107 --> 00:54:42,208
for Alexandria,
for the Hilltop --

680
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:47,380
for all of us.

681
00:54:47,382 --> 00:54:49,315
We can fight them, Rick.

682
00:54:49,317 --> 00:54:53,452
We can find a way to beat them.

683
00:54:53,454 --> 00:54:57,089
We can do this.

684
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:58,758
But...

685
00:55:01,729 --> 00:55:04,564
But...

686
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:11,771
Only if... we do this.

687
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:21,781
Yeah, I know that now.

688
00:55:28,856 --> 00:55:30,856
I know that now.

689
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:42,895
Sasha! Enid!

690
00:56:56,878 --> 00:57:00,246
You're okay?
‭I'm okay.

691
00:57:00,248 --> 00:57:02,048
The baby's okay --

692
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,716
all of us.

693
00:57:05,353 --> 00:57:07,119
You were right...

694
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:11,223
right from the start.

695
00:57:11,225 --> 00:57:15,628
You told us to get ready to fight.

696
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,963
I didn't listen, and I couldn't.

697
00:57:20,868 --> 00:57:23,369
I can now.

698
