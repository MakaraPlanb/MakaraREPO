1
00:00:00,327 --> 00:00:03,264
<i>Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...</i>

2
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:05,742
I only want Negan.

3
00:00:05,844 --> 00:00:07,212
A single bullet ain't gonna do it.

4
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:09,081
Best case, maybe you take him out.

5
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,850
Then make me a bullet.

6
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:13,254
Everything we have, we got from fighting.

7
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:16,425
We play by their rules,
we get some kinda life.

8
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:18,128
You led us all to the promise land,

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,763
isn't that right, Rick?

10
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:21,533
He we are!

11
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:24,070
Oh, I like it here.

12
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:25,839
Saviors can actually be quite reasonable.

13
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:33,217
Maggie.

14
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,949
I know people are saying things...

15
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:43,921
nice things about you and Sasha?

16
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:47,561
They are?

17
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:49,096
They are.

18
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:51,634
About the other night...

19
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:56,207
about how they're thinking
you saved the place.

20
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:58,477
Don't let it go to your head.

21
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:03,785
Well, don't let it bother you.

22
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:05,555
It seems like it bothers you.

23
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:17,806
What you doing up there?

24
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:22,379
You gonna eat that?

25
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,982
Yes.

26
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:27,921
Dude.

27
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:29,823
You know she's pregnant.

28
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,033
Against the grain, kid.

29
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:03,006
Always against the grain.

30
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,665
Damn, that smells good.

31
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,711
Want a taste?

32
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:55,552
Okay.

33
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:08,371
Here's his damn lemonade.

34
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,173
I had some in my kitchen.

35
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,145
Denise liked it.

36
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:21,990
Thank you.

37
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:23,092
Hey.

38
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,098
Go home.

39
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,901
Let me take over.

40
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:32,573
No.

41
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:35,577
I'm fine.

42
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,617
I told Rick I would watch Judith.

43
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:41,119
I'm gonna do that.

44
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:48,329
You should go.

45
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:51,568
We're about to sit.

46
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:21,646
We're gonna need another setting.

47
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:50,789
Today and only today, right?

48
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,526
Yeah.

49
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,902
All these bullet holes...

50
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:01,471
this'll take on water quick.

51
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:09,584
We can probably make it to the canoe.

52
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:11,119
Probably.

53
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:15,092
If you want to stay back...

54
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:18,932
I'm going to pretend you
didn't just say that.

55
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,624
I'm seeing this through.

56
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:37,627
We both are.

57
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,634
I'm not waiting for your dad anymore.

58
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:09,305
I don't know where the hell he is,

59
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:11,175
but Lucille...

60
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:16,817
...is hungry.

61
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:25,697
Carl, pass the rolls...

62
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,238
...Please.

63
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,631
Look at that, huh?

64
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,054
Easy as that.

65
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:35,425
It's just a transaction.

66
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,195
You look like shit,

67
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:38,497
which means you fought for this.

68
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:39,966
You did your jobs.

69
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,804
You get it, and I like that.

70
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:45,807
Negan likes that.

71
00:08:49,282 --> 00:08:51,249
That's... good to hear.

72
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:54,254
You play your cards right,

73
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:57,458
maybe I'll show you where we live.

74
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,228
Maybe I'll buy you a sandwich.

75
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:09,676
Just tell me when.

76
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,679
You like watching, haircut?

77
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,682
Yes.

78
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:15,319
I mean...

79
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,356
You mean to get
the hell out of here.

80
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,558
Now!

81
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:57,482
Morgan.

82
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:03,490
It's just some things from
the Kingdom garden...

83
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:06,528
some nectarines, some apples.

84
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,597
Thank you. I am good.

85
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,067
You can fend for yourself, I know,

86
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,504
but fresh produce isn't
something you can just...

87
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:13,506
Really.

88
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,676
I'm good.

89
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,950
Ezekiel?

90
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:23,853
Apparently, some people are
having a hard time believing me

91
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:26,624
when I say I just want to be left alone.

92
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,029
You know, I was trying to
leave you alone, and I will.

93
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:33,334
But you called me over.

94
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:34,470
Why?

95
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:35,737
How are you?

96
00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:38,275
Good.

97
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:39,610
Good.

98
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:40,946
Now you can go.

99
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:46,087
I think you're going soft.

100
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,789
I think you're going.

101
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,001
- Hey.
- Hi.

102
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:58,805
Carol, hi.

103
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:00,976
I'm sorry to bother you.

104
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:03,613
Morgan, I-I didn't expect
you to be here, too.

105
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:06,183
It's good you are.

106
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:07,852
I wanted to speak to you both, actually.

107
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:09,422
It's about something important.

108
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:17,800
Almost at the canoe.

109
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:21,373
We're taking on water quick, man.

110
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,508
I know.

111
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,658
Rick, on the left!

112
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:06,340
We're almost there.

113
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
No, no!

114
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:32,912
Hold on!

115
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:34,481
Hold on!

116
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:35,816
Stay in the canoe!

117
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:38,354
I can... Just...

118
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,859
Aaron!

119
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,662
Aaron!

120
00:12:51,942 --> 00:12:53,008
Aaron!

121
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:00,387
I'm okay.

122
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,256
I'm all right.

123
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,928
I'm okay.

124
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,263
I'm okay.

125
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,180
Stop hugging the wall.

126
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:42,182
Watch it!

127
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:47,890
God damn it!

128
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,798
Go get a mop and another barrel.

129
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,701
We're keeping this crap?

130
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:57,071
We don't have to eat it.

131
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:58,874
Jesus. He hates pickles.

132
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:09,623
It's got hooks.

133
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,393
I don't know why he didn't strap it in.

134
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:13,929
Told him twice. His
stupid ass didn't listen.

135
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:40,169
Okay.

136
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,515
Bit of a sore loser.

137
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:54,323
Looks like the only thing
he ran out of was ammo.

138
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,861
We got to get this back now.

139
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:58,930
Yeah.

140
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:04,136
Well... he's got paddles.

141
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:05,673
And with the wind picking up,

142
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:08,277
it shouldn't take long
to drift back to shore.

143
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,849
Easy. Easy.

144
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:13,918
We got it. Take this crap back.

145
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,821
How 'bout, this time,
you watch where you're going?

146
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:18,960
Oh, come on. Get off his back.

147
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:37,988
You know, back there,

148
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,360
I didn't mean that you couldn't do it.

149
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:46,033
It's just...

150
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:49,037
going this far, risking this much

151
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,339
to get things for them...

152
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:52,342
people don't agree with it.

153
00:15:52,344 --> 00:15:54,445
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.

154
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:02,290
I was there.

155
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:06,964
I saw what happened on the road.

156
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,402
What we're doing is gonna
keep people living.

157
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:12,773
We get to do that,

158
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:15,778
it doesn't matter what happens to us.

159
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,948
Michonne doesn't think this is living.

160
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:24,523
Well, committing to a choice like this,

161
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,262
after living how we did... free...

162
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:29,363
I get it.

163
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:33,870
It's hard.

164
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:35,139
It's giving up everything,

165
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:40,447
right up until your own life.

166
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,319
But either your heart's
beating, or it isn't.

167
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:46,362
Your loved ones' hearts are
beating, or they aren't.

168
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:53,900
We take what they give
us so that we can live.

169
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:30,890
So, how long you been with Negan?

170
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,298
Why were you out there alone?

171
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:43,237
Tell me!

172
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:58,593
You think talking won't
change how this ends for you.

173
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,896
But you don't know me.

174
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,839
Let's see what happens.

175
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,470
I'm not gonna kill him today.

176
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:30,407
I'm gonna find the way that we win.

177
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:35,915
I'm gonna change how this ends for me.

178
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,121
That's why I'm out here alone.

179
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:52,640
Is that an apple pie?

180
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,309
How did you do that?

181
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:56,112
I could smell it from outside the door.

182
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,849
You baked it?

183
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:02,288
Some guy gave it to us
for what we did.

184
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,691
His little girl said you should
run for President of Hilltop.

185
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:07,061
"Maggie for President."

186
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,340
Do you want a plate?

187
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:17,310
No, I'm good.

188
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:20,949
Did Jesus give you those?

189
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,220
Is he still around?

190
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:27,838
There's some things I wanna
add to his list before he goes out.

191
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:31,631
The kids need something to
write with... pens, pencils.

192
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,000
Are you already president?

193
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:35,471
I've just been talking to people.

194
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:38,040
Jesus left this morning.

195
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,745
He told me to tell you, but I-I forgot.

196
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,816
Okay. Next time.

197
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:45,051
I'm gonna get some milk.

198
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:46,721
- Let me.
- No, I'm good.

199
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,434
What?

200
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:59,540
You're lying to Maggie about Jesus.

201
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:04,213
What makes you say that?

202
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:05,949
A girl who lives in the house.

203
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:07,585
She was telling me about everyone.

204
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:08,821
She said Jesus is a runner

205
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:10,957
and that he left yesterday,

206
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,358
not this morning.

207
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,199
- It's for her own good.
- Why?

208
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:19,937
Because I need to do something,

209
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,439
and she'll want to help me.

210
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,445
You want to kill Negan.

211
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:32,956
What if you have help?

212
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,814
If we had help... a lot of people...

213
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,328
then I wouldn't be afraid to tell her,

214
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,900
because she'd know it
wasn't on her to do it.

215
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:42,737
- But if it's just me, then.
- It isn't just you.

216
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:44,173
You and Maggie aren't the only ones

217
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,407
who want to take Negan out.

218
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:46,342
- There's...
- No, Enid.

219
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:47,544
That's not happening.

220
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,780
And if you care about her,

221
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,148
you don't say anything about this.

222
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:54,188
We have to keep her safe.

223
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,127
You have to keep her safe.

224
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,901
It isn't just you.

225
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:10,178
It sure looks like it.

226
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,630
A lot of places came
together after the world fell apart.

227
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:18,771
Maybe you're both from
one of those places.

228
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:23,833
Most of those communities
and camps are gone now.

229
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,769
I lost people.

230
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:30,911
I pretty much lost hope in people.

231
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:33,480
But then I found the Kingdom.

232
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:36,953
I met Ezekiel.

233
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:38,454
I saw what he built.

234
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:41,259
But now I believe what he
built is under threat.

235
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:42,527
The Saviors.

236
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:46,499
The Saviors.

237
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:48,136
A few months back,

238
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:51,541
Ezekiel and a few guards met a
group of them in the woods.

239
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,145
The Saviors recognized
Ezekiel's capabilities,

240
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,148
and Ezekiel didn't want to fight,

241
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,450
so they cut a deal.

242
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:59,553
In exchange for food and supplies,

243
00:21:59,555 --> 00:22:01,021
no one would get hurt,

244
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:03,692
and they'd never set
foot inside the Kingdom,

245
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:05,829
and very few of us even know.

246
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:08,032
What does any of this have to do with me?

247
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:09,935
I know Ezekiel likes you.

248
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:12,772
I also know that Ezekiel trusts you,

249
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:14,308
and that's why I'm here.

250
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,179
I need you to help me
convince him of something.

251
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:19,749
Right now, we have peace
with the Saviors,

252
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:22,253
but sooner or later,
sometimes's gonna go wrong.

253
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:24,490
Maybe we'll be light on a drop,

254
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:27,327
or maybe one of ours will look
at one of theirs the wrong way,

255
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:31,733
or maybe they'll just decide
to stop honoring the deal.

256
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:35,639
Things will go bad.

257
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:37,075
And when they do...

258
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:42,617
...the Kingdom will fall.

259
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:48,493
I had a family.

260
00:22:48,495 --> 00:22:52,197
I lost it to this world.

261
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:55,202
I saw them die.

262
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:59,409
I'm scared that, if we
don't do something now,

263
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,379
that we won't only lose more people...
we'll lose everything.

264
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,751
I know what the Saviors are,
and I know what they do.

265
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:09,090
And I know they cannot be trusted.

266
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:13,896
And I think you know that, too.

267
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,603
What exactly are you asking?

268
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,460
I'm asking you to help convince Ezekiel

269
00:23:22,461 --> 00:23:26,582
to attack the Saviors, to strike first...

270
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:27,784
and destroy them.

271
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:38,562
Is that for you...

272
00:23:38,563 --> 00:23:40,035
or Negan?

273
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:44,708
It's for him.

274
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:49,081
How will you do it?

275
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,386
I'll pull the trigger.

276
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:54,089
They'll kill you.

277
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:57,694
As long as he goes first.

278
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,532
Why do you have to die?

279
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:02,702
Because he has to.

280
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:10,080
I agree.

281
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,414
But...

282
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,392
...Why do you?

283
00:24:22,265 --> 00:24:23,466
There's...

284
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,274
...No need to lie to me if...

285
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:32,345
this is our last conversation.

286
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:42,327
If Abraham was alive, we could fight.

287
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:45,633
If Glenn was,

288
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:51,207
Maggie's kid would have a father.

289
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:55,047
Michonne and Carl can fight.

290
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:58,051
They have Rick.

291
00:24:58,053 --> 00:25:01,990
Aaron has Eric.

292
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:05,996
Eugene knows things.

293
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:08,332
Daryl's strong.

294
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:12,539
What about Sasha?

295
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:28,262
Look at me, Rosita.

296
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,541
It shouldn't have been you.

297
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:42,718
It shouldn't have been anyone.

298
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,088
We'll win,

299
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,392
but we need to wait for the right moment

300
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:51,396
or create it...

301
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:54,335
together.

302
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:57,072
And you're a part of that together.

303
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:02,312
Don't do this.

304
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:08,790
We need you.

305
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:08,946
Okay. I know
there's a lot of them.

306
00:27:08,948 --> 00:27:11,750
I'm guessing a good deal more
than we have at the Kingdom.

307
00:27:11,752 --> 00:27:14,154
The element of surprise is our only hope.

308
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:15,355
We need to attack first,

309
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:16,657
and we need to do it now

310
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:18,360
while we still have the advantage.

311
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:23,700
Carol, I imagine that
violence and fighting

312
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:25,570
is something you haven't been a part of.

313
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:28,174
You're wrong.

314
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:29,877
You're very wrong.

315
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:32,614
She's probably the most
capable fighter in this room.

316
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:34,684
Then it's time to fight.

317
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,289
No.

318
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:41,094
This is something I am not a part of.

319
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:42,528
Then you don't have to fight.

320
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,331
You just have to convince Ezekiel

321
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,934
to bring the Kingdom to fight.

322
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:48,037
You're not understanding me.

323
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,539
I didn't want you.

324
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,609
I didn't want Ezekiel
or Morgan coming here.

325
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:54,146
And I don't want anything
to do with your lives

326
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:56,249
or your deaths.

327
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:58,619
I just want to be left alone.

328
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,633
People will die... a lot of them.

329
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,402
You killed a man.

330
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:11,272
I took a life to save a life.

331
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:13,575
It's the same goddamn thing!

332
00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:15,678
We'll be taking their lives to save ours!

333
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,280
Only you don't know that it will!

334
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:19,852
You're gonna choose to
kill one day, Morgan,

335
00:28:19,854 --> 00:28:21,855
'cause it will get that bad!

336
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,594
Why not choose now,

337
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:28,664
before you lose someone you care about?

338
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,167
There's a peace now.

339
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,636
I won't be a part of changing that.

340
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:34,673
And maybe we can build on that.

341
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:36,009
Not with these people!

342
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,112
When they turn on us... and they will...

343
00:28:38,114 --> 00:28:40,448
that blood is gonna be on your hands!

344
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,494
But maybe you're both used to that.

345
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:54,303
You should go, too.

346
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:56,373
I should.

347
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:01,746
I don't want anyone else coming around

348
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:03,582
or even knowing where I am.

349
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:05,819
If you somehow see anyone we know,

350
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:07,755
tell them I'm gone.

351
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:09,425
Do that for me please.

352
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:11,161
Never meant for you to see me.

353
00:29:59,994 --> 00:30:01,828
Hi.

354
00:30:03,198 --> 00:30:04,798
Hi.

355
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,840
Hi.

356
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,066
Hot date?

357
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,446
I'm on a good momentum
with them. Gonna try to use that.

358
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:43,612
Yeah? How?

359
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:50,523
By trying to get closer,
even just to start trying.

360
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,192
If I can do that, after a while...

361
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:53,527
maybe months, maybe years...

362
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:55,863
maybe then we try something.

363
00:31:57,635 --> 00:32:00,505
I think it's what my mom would have done,

364
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:01,839
so it's what I'm gonna do.

365
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:05,645
Okay.

366
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,388
Whatever it was...

367
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,026
I thought we had something good...

368
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:17,396
at least, the beginning
of something good.

369
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:19,832
Why'd you end it?

370
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:22,637
Why'd you even start it?

371
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,853
I was trying not to think about shit.

372
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,854
You're cute, tall.

373
00:32:34,856 --> 00:32:38,561
You're sweet sometimes.

374
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:39,829
So I used you.

375
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,644
I'm sorry.

376
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:57,856
Would you be up for dinner later?

377
00:32:57,858 --> 00:32:59,859
I really mean just dinner.

378
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:01,194
No strings.

379
00:33:05,469 --> 00:33:07,103
All right.

380
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:09,273
All right.

381
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:31,773
What the hell?

382
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,956
It's cool, I swear.

383
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,794
Buddy, you can walk right
out that back gate there,

384
00:33:45,796 --> 00:33:49,199
and I won't say anything to anybody.

385
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:51,336
I'm supposed to be there now,

386
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:54,373
but, listen, I'm... I'm
just trying to get by,

387
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:58,179
just like you.

388
00:33:58,181 --> 00:33:59,815
Please.

389
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:02,519
Daryl.

390
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:14,637
Daryl.

391
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:34,500
It ain't just about gettin' by here.

392
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,370
It's about gettin' it all.

393
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:41,009
I got the key. Let's go.

394
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:44,849
- No.
- I just want to talk to him.

395
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:46,117
I said "no."

396
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,588
Don't be an asshole, Arat.

397
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,691
Let the man pass.

398
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:00,572
Oh, crap. Is that for me?

399
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,576
We haven't officially met.

400
00:35:03,578 --> 00:35:07,315
I'm Spencer Monroe.

401
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:08,318
Hi.

402
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:21,725
That's Negan.

403
00:35:35,024 --> 00:35:37,926
Is he down there?

404
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,195
Yeah.

405
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:41,866
We're all Negan.

406
00:35:44,427 --> 00:35:46,194
Whatever you're trying to do, you can't.

407
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:50,267
But you still have some choices.

408
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:52,337
Go home.

409
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:55,842
Burn this car, roll it down into a lake,

410
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:57,712
make it disappear.

411
00:35:59,148 --> 00:36:01,216
There's a silencer in
the glove compartment.

412
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:05,780
Where is he?

413
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:07,582
Negan?

414
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:11,121
He's in your house,
asshole, waiting for you.

415
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,935
Hey.

416
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:22,237
Just like that?

417
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,841
See, we've been waiting for hours

418
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,613
just to see what you gonna bring us, huh?

419
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:30,950
Why don't we have a look first?

420
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:38,495
Running water, air conditioning,

421
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:40,364
a housewarming gift?

422
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:41,900
That settles it.

423
00:37:41,902 --> 00:37:45,739
I am getting myself a vacation home here.

424
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,742
Cheers to that.

425
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,556
Oh, that is good.

426
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:00,427
You know, the only thing
missing is a pool table.

427
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:05,234
Nothing better than a
good game of 8 ball.

428
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:07,671
The house across the street
has one in the garage.

429
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:11,143
Oh, Spencer,

430
00:38:11,145 --> 00:38:14,014
you may just be my new best friend.

431
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:17,753
Such a nice day, though...

432
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,088
too nice to be cooped up

433
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,594
inside some garage, don't you think?

434
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:24,262
Yeah.

435
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:26,533
Oh, I got a better idea.

436
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:37,482
Not bad.

437
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,556
We had to go out pretty far.

438
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:44,225
What the hell's this?

439
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:46,930
"Congrats for winning.
But you still lose"?

440
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,841
You leave us a little love note?

441
00:38:54,843 --> 00:38:57,746
No, I just...

442
00:38:57,748 --> 00:39:01,686
I mean... We wouldn't, obviously...

443
00:39:01,688 --> 00:39:02,853
Wait. What?

444
00:39:02,855 --> 00:39:04,623
Did you just say it's obvious?

445
00:39:08,664 --> 00:39:09,698
We didn't do that.

446
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,201
It's not about the damn note!

447
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:14,370
Hey. Don't.

448
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:16,507
Run along to Negan, Rick.

449
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:28,692
But your friend here...
he's got no place to be.

450
00:39:29,695 --> 00:39:30,996
- You...
- Back up!

451
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,902
I could never do this with Rick.

452
00:39:35,904 --> 00:39:39,241
He would just be standing
there, scowling,

453
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:43,213
giving me that annoying
side-eye he gives me.

454
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:47,219
That's actually what I
came to see you about.

455
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:48,722
I want to talk to you about Rick.

456
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,232
All right.

457
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:58,169
Talk to me, Spencer.

458
00:39:58,171 --> 00:40:00,105
Talk to me about Rick.

459
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:11,622
I get what you're trying to do here,

460
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:13,192
what you're trying to build.

461
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:15,628
I'm not saying I agree with your methods,

462
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,797
but I get it.

463
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:18,465
You're building a network.

464
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:21,705
You're making people contribute
for the greater good.

465
00:40:21,707 --> 00:40:24,575
It makes sense.

466
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:27,613
But you should know that Rick Grimes

467
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:30,283
has a history of not
working well with others.

468
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:35,792
Is that so?

469
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:41,366
Rick wasn't the original leader here.

470
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:43,002
My mom was.

471
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:46,274
She was doing a really good job of it.

472
00:40:46,276 --> 00:40:50,513
Then she died, not long
after Rick showed up...

473
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:53,084
same with my brother, same with my dad.

474
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:57,523
So, everything was peachy here for...
what... years?

475
00:40:57,525 --> 00:41:02,531
And then Rick shows up, and
suddenly, you're an orphan?

476
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:06,704
That is the saddest
story I've ever heard.

477
00:41:06,706 --> 00:41:09,904
Good thing for you he's
not in charge anymore.

478
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:11,279
Doesn't matter.

479
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,114
His ego's out of control.

480
00:41:13,116 --> 00:41:15,885
He'll find a way to screw things up,

481
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:19,123
to try and do things
his way, to take over.

482
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,559
That's what he did with my mom.

483
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:22,862
That's what he'll do again.

484
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,378
What exactly are you proposing
be done about that?

485
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:38,384
I am my mother's son.

486
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:42,057
I can be the leader she was.

487
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:43,392
That's what this place needs.

488
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:44,694
That's what you need.

489
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:49,702
So I should put you in charge...

490
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:51,038
that's what you're saying?

491
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:54,175
We'd be much better off.

492
00:41:58,217 --> 00:41:59,783
You're all right. You're all right.

493
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:03,689
All right, all right, all right.

494
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:04,924
Point made.

495
00:42:14,307 --> 00:42:17,810
My heart's still beating, right?

496
00:42:22,586 --> 00:42:26,123
You know, I'm thinking, Spencer.

497
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:29,460
I'm thinking how Rick
threatened to kill me,

498
00:42:29,462 --> 00:42:32,866
how he clearly hates my guts.

499
00:42:32,868 --> 00:42:36,105
But he is out there right now,

500
00:42:36,107 --> 00:42:38,909
gathering shit for me to make sure

501
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:43,782
I don't hurt any of the
fine people that live here.

502
00:42:43,784 --> 00:42:46,921
He is swallowing his hate

503
00:42:46,923 --> 00:42:51,827
and getting shit done.

504
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:53,563
That takes guts.

505
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:03,178
And then there's you...

506
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,018
...The guy who waited for Rick to be gone

507
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,288
so he could sneak over and talk to me

508
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,091
to get me to do his dirty work,

509
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:14,829
so he could take Rick's place.

510
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:16,730
So I got to ask...

511
00:43:16,732 --> 00:43:20,203
if you wanna take over,

512
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:22,573
why not just kill Rick yourself

513
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:25,244
and just take over?

514
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:26,145
What? No, no.

515
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:27,314
I didn't... I don't...

516
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:29,049
You know what I'm thinking?

517
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:34,257
'Cause I have a guess.

518
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:38,780
It's because you got no guts.

519
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,867
How embarrassing.

520
00:44:04,871 --> 00:44:06,239
There they are.

521
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:08,108
They were inside you the whole time.

522
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,410
You did have guts.

523
00:44:09,412 --> 00:44:13,382
I've never been so wrong
in my whole life!

524
00:44:33,013 --> 00:44:39,421
Now, someone oughta get up
here and clean this mess up.

525
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:52,474
Anyone want to finish the game?

526
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:53,842
C'mon.

527
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:57,815
Anybody?

528
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,019
Anybody?

529
00:45:02,557 --> 00:45:05,192
C'mon.

530
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:06,728
I was winning!

531
00:45:18,943 --> 00:45:20,309
Shit!

532
00:45:20,311 --> 00:45:22,680
What the shit?!

533
00:45:22,682 --> 00:45:26,285
Shit! You just... You tried to kill me?!

534
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:27,888
You shot Lucille!

535
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,423
She got in the way.

536
00:45:42,265 --> 00:45:44,045
What is this?

537
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:49,019
What is this?

538
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:52,023
This little bad boy made from scratch?

539
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:54,861
Look at those crimps.

540
00:45:54,863 --> 00:45:57,531
This was homemade.

541
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:59,735
You may be stupid, darlin',

542
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:04,743
but you showed some real ingenuity here.

543
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:11,686
Arat, move that knife up
out on that girl's face.

544
00:46:13,157 --> 00:46:16,727
Lucille's beautiful, smooth surface

545
00:46:16,729 --> 00:46:18,529
is never gonna look the same,

546
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:20,032
so why should yours?!

547
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:23,538
Unless...

548
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:30,914
Unless you tell me who made this.

549
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,418
It was me.

550
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,221
I made it.

551
00:46:35,223 --> 00:46:39,728
You see, now I just think you're lying.

552
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,532
And you lying to me now?!

553
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,473
Such a shame.

554
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:50,310
Arat's gonna have to cut
up that pretty face.

555
00:46:51,715 --> 00:46:53,414
One more try.

556
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:55,250
It was me.

557
00:46:58,324 --> 00:47:01,259
You are such a badass!

558
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:05,365
Fine.

559
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:09,338
Have it your way.

560
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,341
Arat...

561
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,078
Kill somebody.

562
00:47:14,682 --> 00:47:16,850
No. It was me!

563
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:18,085
No!

564
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,851
We had an agreement.

565
00:47:39,853 --> 00:47:41,019
Rick!

566
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:44,124
Look, everybody, it's Rick.

567
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:46,862
Ah, your people are
making me lose my voice

568
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,130
doin' all this yelling.

569
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:52,702
Rick... how about a "thank you"?

570
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:59,380
I mean, look, I know we
started this relationship

571
00:47:59,382 --> 00:48:02,885
with me beating the holy
shit out of your friends,

572
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:05,088
and because of that, we're
never gonna sit around

573
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,523
and braid each other's hair

574
00:48:06,525 --> 00:48:08,193
or share our deepest, darkest secrets,

575
00:48:08,195 --> 00:48:10,696
but how about a little credit?

576
00:48:10,698 --> 00:48:12,933
I just bent over backwards

577
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:16,839
to show you how reasonable I am.

578
00:48:16,841 --> 00:48:18,775
Your kid...

579
00:48:18,777 --> 00:48:20,912
he hid in one of my trucks

580
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:24,184
and machine-gunned a
bunch of my men down,

581
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:28,056
and I brought him home, safe and sound,

582
00:48:28,058 --> 00:48:30,693
and I fed him spaghetti.

583
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:38,738
Another one of your people...

584
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,245
well, he wanted me to kill
you and put him in charge.

585
00:48:43,247 --> 00:48:47,051
I took him out... for you.

586
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:50,789
And another one, here...

587
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:55,296
she shot Lucille, trying
to kill me just now,

588
00:48:55,298 --> 00:48:57,266
so I gave you one less mouth to feed.

589
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,870
And by looking at her...

590
00:48:59,872 --> 00:49:02,674
that mouth did some major damage.

591
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:04,276
Now, personally,

592
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,145
I wouldn't have picked
her to be the one to go,

593
00:49:06,147 --> 00:49:07,781
but Arat...

594
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:09,517
I don't know... didn't trust her.

595
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,801
Your shit's waiting for you at the gate.

596
00:49:20,803 --> 00:49:22,103
Just go.

597
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:26,175
Sure thing, Rick...

598
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:29,647
right after I find the guy or gal

599
00:49:29,649 --> 00:49:33,686
that made this bullet.

600
00:49:33,688 --> 00:49:35,022
Arat?

601
00:49:38,396 --> 00:49:40,230
It was me!

602
00:49:40,232 --> 00:49:42,666
No, it wasn't.

603
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:52,748
It was me.

604
00:49:54,753 --> 00:49:56,387
It was only me.

605
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:58,424
You?

606
00:50:01,096 --> 00:50:04,666
It required one spent casing,
one four-holed turret reloader,

607
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,936
powder, one funnel for the powder...

608
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:08,272
Shut up.

609
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:12,345
I believe you.

610
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:29,903
Lucille, give me strength.

611
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:40,285
I'm gonna be relieving you of
your bullet maker, Rick...

612
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:44,726
that and whatever you left
for me at the front gate.

613
00:50:44,728 --> 00:50:47,463
And however much you scavenged,

614
00:50:47,465 --> 00:50:49,633
it's not good enough,

615
00:50:49,635 --> 00:50:54,507
because you're still in
a serious, serious hole

616
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,975
after today.

617
00:51:00,317 --> 00:51:01,518
Let's move out!

618
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,491
No! No, no!

619
00:51:06,493 --> 00:51:08,127
Please, just take me!

620
00:51:08,129 --> 00:51:09,863
No!

621
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:12,833
Rick, I ain't gonna lie...

622
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:16,606
your kitchen is a goddamn mess.

623
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:20,045
I'll see you next time.

624
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:20,693
Carl told me you were in here.

625
00:52:20,695 --> 00:52:21,894
I...

626
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:50,270
I found what I was looking for.

627
00:52:55,913 --> 00:53:00,218
I wanted to go with you and Aaron,

628
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,255
but I couldn't.

629
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,694
I had to go my way.

630
00:53:06,696 --> 00:53:08,797
But when I found it...

631
00:53:10,392 --> 00:53:14,439
...I realized that...

632
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:18,646
I didn't want it to be my way.

633
00:53:18,648 --> 00:53:23,152
I wanted it to be ours... me and you.

634
00:53:30,232 --> 00:53:33,434
There are more of them,
even more than we thought.

635
00:53:33,436 --> 00:53:38,007
We are outnumbered. It's not even close.

636
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:40,344
But that doesn't change
the way that I feel,

637
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:43,916
because it doesn't change
the way that things are.

638
00:53:43,918 --> 00:53:46,754
We're still alive, Rick.

639
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,957
So much has happened,

640
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,328
so much that we shouldn't
have lived through.

641
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,796
And...

642
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:55,767
and in spite of it or
maybe because of it,

643
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:57,737
we did.

644
00:53:59,174 --> 00:54:04,179
We're still here, the two of us.

645
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:08,052
We're still standing, and
we're gonna keep standing.

646
00:54:08,054 --> 00:54:11,858
So, what do we do with that?

647
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:16,831
How do we make that mean something?

648
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,970
We're the ones who get things done.

649
00:54:19,972 --> 00:54:23,509
You said that.

650
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,579
We're the ones who live.

651
00:54:30,588 --> 00:54:34,024
That's why we have to fight...

652
00:54:34,026 --> 00:54:40,901
not for us, but for Judith, for Carl,

653
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:44,006
for Alexandria, for the Hilltop...

654
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:49,180
for all of us.

655
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:51,116
We can fight them, Rick.

656
00:54:51,118 --> 00:54:55,255
We can find a way to beat them.

657
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:58,894
We can do this.

658
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,564
But...

659
00:55:03,537 --> 00:55:06,373
But...

660
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:13,583
Only if... we do this.

661
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:23,598
Yeah, I know that now.

662
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:32,678
I know that now.

663
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:44,786
Sasha! Enid!

664
00:56:58,775 --> 00:57:02,144
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

665
00:57:02,146 --> 00:57:03,947
The baby's okay...

666
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:05,617
all of us.

667
00:57:07,254 --> 00:57:09,667
You were right...

668
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:13,128
right from the start.

669
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:17,535
You told us to get ready to fight.

670
00:57:17,537 --> 00:57:19,871
I didn't listen, and I couldn't.

671
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:25,279
I can now.
