to the Promised Land!

680
00:50:56,825 --> 00:50:58,025
Isn't that right, Rick?!

681
00:50:58,027 --> 00:51:00,193
Here we are!

682
00:51:00,195 --> 00:51:04,831
I guess Glenn and Abraham
were lucky, too?

683
00:51:10,306 --> 00:51:14,207
You say anything
like that again to me,

684
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:16,810
I'll break your jaw,
knock your teeth out.

685
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:20,814
You understand?

686
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:23,417

Uh-huh.

691
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:46,673
Why didn't you tell me
after I --

692
00:51:46,675 --> 00:51:49,910
You saw what I did to get one,

693
00:51:49,912 --> 00:51:51,244
that I need bullets.

694
00:51:51,246 --> 00:51:52,813
I had them for a while

695
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:55,015

696
00:51:57,353 --> 00:52:01,188

being in charge.

You were right.

That rifle

I made the choice.

There aren't enough of us.
It's about numbers.

There's the Hilltop.

714
00:53:57,172 --> 00:54:00,574
They'd still have the numbers.

He was my partner.

721
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:30,837
He got Lori and Carl to safety
right after it all started.

722
00:54:34,009 --> 00:54:36,476
I couldn't.
I was in the hospital.

723
00:54:36,478 --> 00:54:39,179
I-I didn't know...
what was happenin'.

724

My friend...

725
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,019
His name was Shane.

726
00:54:49,324 --> 00:54:53,393
Well, him and Lori...

727
00:54:53,395 --> 00:54:57,063
they were together.

728
00:54:57,065 --> 00:55:01,635

She's my daughter.

734
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:19,886
But she isn't mine.

735
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:23,023
I had to accept that.

736
00:55:23,025 --> 00:55:25,158
I did.

737
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,928

738
00:55:31,733 --> 00:55:34,201

and I hope that's
a long time from now

00:55:36,371 --> 00:55:38,171
so I can...

741
00:55:38,173 --> 00:55:42,075
raise her and protect her
and teach her how to survive.

742
00:55:45,814 --> 00:55:49,282
This is how we live now.

743
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:50,850
I had to accept that, too,

744
00:55:50,852 --> 00:55:53,053
so I could keep everyone else alive.

sometimes it is.

all of us do --

749
00:56:07,669 --> 00:56:10,003
or it won't work.
