Isn't that right, Rick?!

681
00:50:54,277 --> 00:50:56,443
Here we are!

682
00:50:56,445 --> 00:51:01,081
I guess Glenn and Abraham
were lucky, too?

683
00:51:06,556 --> 00:51:10,457
You say anything
like that again to me,

684
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:13,060
I'll break your jaw,
knock your teeth out.

Uh-huh.

Why didn't you tell me
after I --

692
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:46,160
You saw what I did to get one,

693
00:51:46,162 --> 00:51:47,494
that I need bullets.

694

It's about numbers.

He got Lori and Carl to safety

722
00:54:30,259 --> 00:54:32,726
I couldn't.
I was in the hospital.

I-I didn't know...
what was happenin'.

My friend...

725
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:42,269
His name was Shane.

726
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:49,643
Well, him and Lori...

727
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:53,313
they were together.

She's my daughter.

734

But she isn't mine.

735
00:55:16,138 --> 00:55:19,273
I had to accept that.

736
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:21,408
I did.

737
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,178

a long time from now

00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,421

741
00:55:34,423 --> 00:55:38,325
raise her and protect her

743
00:55:45,534 --> 00:55:47,100
I had to accept that, too,

744
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:49,303
