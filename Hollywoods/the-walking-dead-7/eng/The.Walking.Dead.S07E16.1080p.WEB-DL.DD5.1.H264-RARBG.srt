to this moment now...

738
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:41,011
not as strangers...

739
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:44,639
as family...

740
00:58:17,865 --> 00:58:22,521
because Glenn chose
to be there for you that day

741
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,045
a long time ago.

742
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,251
That was the decision
that changed everything.

743
00:58:38,046 --> 00:58:40,172
It started with both of you,

744
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:42,327
and it just grew...

745
00:58:43,765 --> 00:58:45,913
to all of us...

746
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:54,209
to sacrifice for each other...

747
00:59:05,856 --> 00:59:09,124
to suffer and stand,

748
00:59:09,126 --> 00:59:14,129
to grieve, to give,

749
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:20,369
to love, to live...

750
00:59:20,371 --> 00:59:22,504
to fight for each other.

751
00:59:22,506 --> 00:59:27,643
[no dialogue]

752
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:29,869
Glenn made the decision, Rick.

753
00:59:32,205 --> 00:59:34,572
I was just following his lead.
