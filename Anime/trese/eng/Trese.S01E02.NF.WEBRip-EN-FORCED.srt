1
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,192
And so does my uncle.

2
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,802
They're not just any locals, bossing.

3
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:57,615
Señor Armanaz, Great Stallion
and Lord of the <i>Tikbalang</i>.

4
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,122
Busy night, bossing.

5
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,378
Not any more than you, Bagyon Lektro.

6
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,274
I know how your family operates,
Bagyong Lektro.

7
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,632
I am Maliksi, Prince of the <i>Tikbalang.</i>

8
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,638
And I was mistaken to think
that a prince of the <i>Tikbalang</i>

9
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,515
would still honor the code of the race.

10
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,510
Find out anything good, bossing?

11
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,307
Bagyong Lektro wasn't there.

12
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,065
Looks like he's already
making his move, bossing.

13
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,067
Bagyong Kulimlim.

14
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,522
How are you, little Trese?

15
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,422
Coffee, bossing?

16
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,497
Oh, sounds like
he has a crush on you, bossing.

17
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,139
Good morning, Bagyong Lektro.

18
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,185
You extended the courtesy
to the <i>Tikbalang.</i>

19
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,231
Courtesy went out the door

20
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,567
when Bagyong Kulimlim
attacked me in the open.
