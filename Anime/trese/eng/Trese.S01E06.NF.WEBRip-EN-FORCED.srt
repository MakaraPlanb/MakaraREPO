1
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,833
- Older brother started it.
- You're crazy!

2
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,653
They killed a <i>Sigbin</i>
and almost killed you.

3
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,743
Datu Talagbusao.

4
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,834
Bagyong Lektro, you traitor!

5
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,730
The <i>Tikbalang</i> have fought alongside
the Treses for centuries.

6
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,284
This Datu Talagbusao
wants to bring about the end of the world.

7
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,798
On it, bossing.

8
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,539
I, Datu Talagbusao, the god of war.

9
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,080
<i>The self-appointed</i> Lakan.

10
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,961
Your position as <i>Lakan</i>
has made you arrogant, Trese.

11
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:51,023
The <i>Aswang,</i> the <i>Tikbalang,</i>
your friends, your family.

12
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,633
We'll be right here
when you return, bossing.

13
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,944
- Hit him.
- Way ahead of you, bossing.

14
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,283
I hope you've got a plan, bossing.

15
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,377
Always have, bossing.

16
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,895
<i>Lead the way, bossing.</i>

17
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,488
It's the <i>barako</i>
you've been drinking, buddy.

18
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:49,948
Fuck you.
