1
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,695
I haven't had a battle like this
in centuries.

2
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,613
More!

3
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,496
Give him another, Santelmo.

4
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,673
A Trese with a thirst for battle.

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,470
Got your back, kid.

6
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:13,490
Striking from the shadows
like a coward, Anton.

7
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:25,502
I expected something more from you
than a paltry banishing spell.

8
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,755
Something with more bite.

9
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,799
Papa!

10
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,031
We won, right, Papa?

11
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,574
The fight's over?

12
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,409
This one is.

13
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,746
There'll be more to come, Alexandra.

14
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,666
We have to be ready always.

15
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,499
<i>Nearly an entire block
of the Pedro Lungsod slums</i>

16
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:33,171
<i>was decimated when a vigilante group
raided a drug lab in the area.</i>

17
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,675
<i>The body count is said to be
in the double digits</i>

18
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,012
<i>with severe property damage
in and around the area.</i>

19
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,599
<i>The local</i> barangay <i>hall
was turned into a temporary morgue</i>

20
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,517
<i>due to the large number of casualties.</i>

21
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,548
<i>The investigation is also linking
the massacre</i>

22
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,343
<i>to ex-Mayor Sancho Santamaria's bid</i>

23
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,721
<i>to clear the land
for the construction of property.</i>

24
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,932
<i>More details as we get them.</i>

25
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,477
All those Precinct Four cops
are really giving us a bad name.

26
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,397
For the boys.

27
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,274
Who got the late shift?

28
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,360
Reyes, Javier, and Nicholas.

29
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,612
They're not back yet.

30
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,447
Hmph.

31
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,242
Probably eating at that <i>tapsi</i> place
two streets down.

32
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,204
Remind Ramirez to fix the toilet, huh?

33
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,248
...resisting arrest, too!

34
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,038
Really?

35
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,546
Hoy, hoy! That's enough!

36
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,424
Drunk and disorderly, Cap.
Got to set him straight.

37
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,092
For Christ's sake, Reyes.

38
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,845
You're acting like those thugs
from Precinct Four.

39
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,180
Well, they get results, don't they?

40
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,141
He fought back is all I know.

41
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,892
That's not how I see it.

42
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,145
I told you, I want none
of that quota shit here.

43
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,317
I'm sorry about my men.

44
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,569
We're all assholes here, but...

45
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,031
I'm trying to be a lesser one,
if you can believe that.

46
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,244
You process this guy by the book.

47
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,705
Or what? You'll call this witch on us?

48
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,792
Why bother? Legazpi from Accounting
is enough to take you out.

49
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,252
Get on with it.

50
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,007
What else do we have for today?

51
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,219
We're still counting,

52
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,806
but it looks like it's
over 50 missing bodies, Cap.

53
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,853
It's always something Tapia, I swear.

54
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,064
You want to call in your friend?

55
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,902
No need.

56
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,196
Just some punks who think they're funny.

57
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,279
What's next?

58
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,632
Whoa!

59
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,510
Didn't figure you
for a hard puncher, <i>bossing.</i>

60
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,930
Had you pegged as an out boxer for sure.

61
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,642
Was it this bad when my father was around?

62
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,228
What's going on, <i>bossing</i>?

63
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,481
The Underworld's starting
to step out of line.

64
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,943
Amang Paso's warning
about "liars amongst your allies"

65
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,403
makes it feel that the accords
will be broken.

66
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,449
But there are consequences
to breaking them.

67
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,076
Your father made that very clear.

68
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,954
With words, Hank, not action.

69
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,541
They aren't afraid of the consequences
because they haven't seen them yet.

70
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,169
So the gloves are coming off.

71
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,256
Respect went out the window
when Kulimlim tried to kill us.

72
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,676
They need to be afraid,
not of a bunch of dusty scrawls,

73
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,636
of me.

74
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,974
Your father would have called
the Council in,

75
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,893
use all the diplomatic channels he could.

76
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,647
He's not here. I'm all we've got.

77
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,108
Something's coming, Hank.

78
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,819
I'm just sick of being two steps behind.

79
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,159
Guerrero's got a case.

80
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,870
Go. Help the Captain.

81
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,954
Thanks, Hank.

82
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,206
You guys need a ride?

83
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,418
We'll be fine.
What's the worst that could happen?

84
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,637
Couldn't we have a magic doorway here?

85
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,432
If this day gets any hotter,
I'm going to have to hit on it.

86
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,064
Dragon gates need
dragon's blood to activate.

87
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,150
We're in short supply as it is.

88
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,862
- What is this?
- Where's my father?

89
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,780
Calm down.

90
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,034
We're working to see where the bodies
of your loved ones have gone.

91
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,717
- Why won't you tell us anything?
- You are animals!

92
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,182
- Where's my father?
- I want answers, now!

93
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,999
Thanks for coming, Alexandra.

94
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,462
Keeping the jacket on, boy, huh?

95
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,048
Style before comfort. Nice.

96
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,467
Captain, I read your message.

97
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,135
How many corpses are missing?

98
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,261
All of them.

99
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,644
<i>In other news, Mayor Santamaria
released a statement from prison</i>

100
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,887
<i>claiming he had nothing to do</i>

101
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,231
<i>with the killings
at the Pedro Lungsod slums</i>

102
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,609
<i>nor the missing bodies
from Barangay Magdalo Hall.</i>

103
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,362
This smells
as bad as Basilio's room.

104
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,696
Hey, that's...

105
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,657
...actually true.

106
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,284
Whatever took them needed the entire body.

107
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,703
Even aswang scavengers leave something.

108
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,497
This feels like a spell.

109
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,666
It may take a while to know for sure.

110
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,209
Take your time, Alexandra.

111
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,629
I've got a ton of paperwork
waiting back at the precinct.

112
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,799
If all this goes south,

113
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,844
try and keep
the property damage down, okay?

114
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,103
<i>Anak ng Inang Buwakaw,</i>

115
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,894
<i>tulungan ang mga namamatay.</i>

116
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,815
<i>Aguhon.</i>

117
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,657
Store's closed, Hank. I'm busy.

118
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,500
Amang Paso said some stuff
might be going down,

119
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,420
but he's literally gone to ground.

120
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,632
<i>Bossing</i>'s got a hunch
that you might know something.

121
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,385
I don't know. I didn't hear nothing.
Didn't see nothing.

122
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,344
Best to hide.

123
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,888
I'm not playing, Nuno.

124
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,307
Start talking or you...

125
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,309
Okay! Okay!

126
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,936
A lot of tribes are on edge.

127
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,855
Aswang more than most.

128
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,898
And they're stocking up
on muscle and magic.

129
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,818
Making bad deals with badder folk.

130
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,779
You want my advice?

131
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,490
Keep your heads down.

132
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,411
Hopefully, we all come out
of this in one piece.

133
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,208
You could have been
a bit more polite, Hank!

134
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,546
Rude.

135
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,611
<i>Lakan</i> of humanity, good evening.

136
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,364
Good evening, Emissary.

137
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,866
What business does
the Court of Death have with us?

138
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,744
There are souls of the dead

139
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,164
that have not yet boarded
the train as scheduled.

140
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:09,293
Ibu requests
that you look into it.

141
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,467
The missing souls are tethered
to this plane.

142
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,718
They have been contained.

143
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,720
In what, <i>Lakan?</i>

144
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,640
<i>Fuck shit!</i>

145
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,560
Internal investigators are saying
you were seen at the slums

146
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,146
during the massacre,
that you shot his brother.

147
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,566
Hmm, what difference does it make?

148
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,943
- Cap.
- What?

149
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,361
You got to see this.

150
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,991
They're coming for revenge.

151
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,451
What is it?

152
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,370
Summoning stone used to raise the dead.

153
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,915
Comes in threes, two wells and one beacon.

154
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,585
We have to find the other two
and destroy them all at once

155
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,211
if we want to break the spell.

156
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,257
Emissary, tell your mistress
to expect the souls soon.

157
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,385
The mistress thanks you for your efforts.

158
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,888
She will remember this favor.

159
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,349
Let's put an end to this.

160
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,196
Ibwa.

161
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,199
I hear everyone's arming up.

162
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,118
You'll lose more than your other eye

163
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,163
if you don't tell me
what's got you all on edge.

164
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,916
Okay, okay, it's the Mayor, man.

165
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,876
Someone big's backing him up.

166
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,130
Whoever it is, they're moving in
on a lot of business and territory.

167
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,758
We just want to be ready
when they come for us.

168
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,885
That's all I know. I swear.

169
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,095
It better be.

170
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,641
Stand back!

171
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,069
Forget it, Tapia.

172
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,239
Start evacuating the station.
This isn't going to hold.

173
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,285
We get it.

174
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,455
We might not have done right
by those people out there,

175
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,251
but we have to do right
by the people in here.

176
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,418
Okay?

177
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,211
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,886
I hope you're calling
to say that you've got a solution

179
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,473
for all these dead bodies that
are overrunning my precinct, Alexandra.

180
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,391
<i>What?</i>

181
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,851
Guess not.

182
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,062
<i>Didn't think
they would be there, Captain,</i>

183
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,374
<i>but that saves me the trouble
of finding the third stone.</i>

184
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,315
What stone?

185
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,279
<i>An end
to all our troubles, Captain.</i>

186
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,860
<i>Sit tight.</i>

187
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,060
These dudes keep coming.

188
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,537
Where's the stone, <i>bossing</i>?

189
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,760
Oh, it's over there,
surrounded by that massive flesh

190
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,804
and bone and blood that wants to kill us.

191
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,180
It can try.

192
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,862
How are we doing
with the evacuation, Tapia?

193
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,531
Last few people are
on the way out, Cap. We're good.

194
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,867
Good time as any to abandon ship.

195
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,118
You're sure we got everyone?

196
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,953
It's just that drunk in the cells.

197
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,456
No sense in going back for him.

198
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,291
I got to go back for the prisoner.

199
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,043
Cap, that's suicide.

200
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,049
It's always something, Tapia.

201
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,151
Bring it in for Team Trese.

202
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,153
Team Trese on three.

203
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,906
Save the back-patting for later.

204
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,325
The Center and this graveyard
just provided someone

205
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,369
with enough undead to make a small army.

206
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,161
Dragon's blood.

207
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,042
Do we have to, <i>bossing</i>?

208
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,585
I hate dragon gates.

209
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,128
I love them.

210
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,590
You always throw up
when you go through, it's hilarious.

211
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,268
Go, Team Trese.

212
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,354
We are not calling ourselves that.

213
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,500
Hello?

214
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,835
Are you still alive?

215
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,635
Easy. I've got you.

216
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,397
You cops scare so easily.

217
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,900
With all the people you've killed,
I expected tougher.

218
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,903
I'm here to get you out, son.
Give me the keys.

219
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,281
Don't need your help, old man.

220
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,949
I'm just here to enjoy the show.

221
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,660
Best seats in the house.

222
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,555
I got your back, Cap.

223
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,102
Cutting it a little close there, Tapia.

224
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,815
Oh, here it comes.

225
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,320
I hate you so much.

226
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,697
Our stop's coming up.

227
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,664
We're not going to last
much longer, Cap. Hurry it up.

228
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,875
You can hate me later, son,

229
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,170
but those things could eat us all
if we don't get out of here.

230
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,379
Save it!

231
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,465
None of you cops are saints.

232
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,009
The ones who gunned down
my brother sure ain't.

233
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,636
You all had this coming.

234
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,139
There's still a chance
that we can all walk out of this.

235
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,892
What's my name?

236
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,727
What?

237
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:30,442
We're not people to you,
we're just numbers, statistics.

238
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,946
If you really gave a damn,
you would put names to all our faces.

239
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,532
So say it. What is my name?

240
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,248
Didn't think so.

241
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,336
Cap!

242
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,098
This is taking too long. Stand back, boys.

243
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,147
Hello, Santelmo.

244
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,566
Hello, little Trese.

245
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,775
Care to play?

246
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,624
Always wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

247
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,001
Huh?

248
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,054
Didn't think
you meant that, literally, Cap.

249
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,393
Captain Guerrero, are you all right?

250
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,937
No, not yet.

251
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,273
They all have to suffer.

252
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,901
We have to destroy the stone.

253
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,944
Wait!

254
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,280
- Wait.
- We don't have the time.

255
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,074
Santelmo can only
hold them off for so long.

256
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,493
It's one man
versus countless others, Captain.

257
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,287
Alexandra, please.

258
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,289
Help me save this one.

259
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:17,174
Jose Alvarez, Josie Santiago,
Ronaldo Lopez.

260
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,342
What?

261
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:23,347
Karen Arcilla, Seth Topacio, a lot more.

262
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,682
Names of people like your brother.

263
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,185
Not a day goes by I don't think of them.

264
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:33,857
So if this is it for all of us,
just tell me your name.

265
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,027
So I can at least remember you, too.

266
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,865
Raul.

267
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,285
Raul Lazaro.

268
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,375
Please, Raul, give us the stone.

269
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,270
Boys.

270
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,004
I miss my brother.

271
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,551
I know, son. I know.

272
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,770
Hey, it's a little stale,
but it's still the best in Manila.

273
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,273
Thank you. You're a good man, Captain.

274
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,235
How you keep together
in all this insanity, I'll never know.

275
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,196
Your father was a good man.

276
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,657
I'm... just a cop.

277
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,119
I don't understand half of the shit
that goes down here,

278
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,664
but you do what you can, Alexandra.

279
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,833
That's the job, isn't it?

280
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,003
It is.

281
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,217
<i>Holy</i> kamote.

282
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,512
That is some piece of information.

283
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,768
Hopefully, this is
the start of reparations

284
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,353
between young Trese and I.

285
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,190
Please send her my regards.

286
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,235
Hey, buddy, we're closed.
