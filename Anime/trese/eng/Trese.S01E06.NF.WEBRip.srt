1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,094
Hey, I wanna try it.

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,304
I was first. You get the other one.

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,057
I said I wanna try it.

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,892
Give me.

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,519
Mine.

6
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,032
Hey, quit it.

7
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,410
I said quit it.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,372
What did Papa say about
fooling around in the library?

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,874
<i>Kuya</i> started it.

10
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,042
You're crazy!

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,710
It was his idea.

12
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,755
I don't care who started it.
As long as you both stop.

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,674
You can't tell us what to do.

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,885
Yeah, you ain't our boss.

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,388
As long as I have to babysit
the two of you, I might as well be.

16
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,065
Basilio, Crispin!

17
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,488
I'd advise against you
hitting my daughter.

18
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,743
People forget she can hit back.

19
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,632
But as long as you're in this house,
you are part of this family.

20
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,676
And family protect each other.

21
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,311
Alexandra.

22
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,275
They aren't family, Papa,
they're murderers.

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,653
They killed the <i>sigbin</i>
and almost killed you.

24
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,073
They are lost children
in need of guidance,

25
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,950
like how I've guided you.

26
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,993
But those brats don't listen.

27
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,495
They don't trust anyone.

28
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,704
Except you.

29
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,876
I'm not you, Papa.

30
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,676
You don't have to be.

31
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,471
They don't trust you
because you don't trust yourself.

32
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,600
Soon, you'll have to forge
your own path, Alexandra.

33
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,310
It won't be easy,

34
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,356
but should you choose true,
they will follow.

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,152
Everyone will.

36
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,693
Alexandra Trese.

37
00:03:55,777 --> 00:04:00,073
The path you've chosen has led you to me.

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,743
<i>Datu</i> Talagbusao.

39
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,498
The last we met,
I had your father on a spear.

40
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,750
Then I'm here to return the favor.

41
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,336
Such fight.

42
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:18,716
You and my children have grown
into the warriors I knew you to be.

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,593
No thanks to you, Dad.

44
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,180
You're too late. Talagbusao.
The battle is over.

45
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:29,060
This battle has been raging
for longer than you can imagine, Trese.

46
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:34,649
It will continue to rage
long after all of you are dead.

47
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,652
Not if we send you back
to whatever hell you came from.

48
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,419
You can't run away
from the inevitable.

49
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,337
Fighting a god wasn't part
of our arrangement.

50
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,672
Neither is the apocalypse.

51
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,173
So saddle up, Maliksi,

52
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,384
or both our worlds are gonna be destroyed.

53
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,597
This is why I hate family reunions.

54
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,267
Shouldn't let men do a woman's job.

55
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,937
Besides, we can't leave
you boys with all the fun.

56
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,606
You fools.

57
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,861
All willing to die for a cause
none of you understand.

58
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:25,533
I will bring this world to ruin,
as I have countless times before.

59
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,330
The storm has finally come, Trese.

60
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,665
And you're on the wrong side of it.

61
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,961
Bagyon Lektro, you traitor,
you're being played a fool by Talagbusao.

62
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,798
The only fool here is you,
the murderer of my son.

63
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,051
Clinging to old, antiquated alliances.

64
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,138
Your son brought it on himself,
just like what you are doing now.

65
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:51,934
Lies. Lies that you and all
your precious allies will pay for.

66
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,730
The <i>Tikbalang</i> have fought alongside
the Treses for centuries.

67
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,774
We shall not abandon them now.

68
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,944
I, too, pledged allegiance
to the Treses once.

69
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,196
And how do they repay me?

70
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,823
They murdered my only son!

71
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,379
I've always wondered
what it was like to kill a god.

72
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,424
Then you will be disappointed.

73
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,976
Hannah!

74
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,153
We're getting our asses kicked

75
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,489
and I don't even know
what the hell is going on.

76
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,284
This <i>Datu</i> Talagbusao
wants to bring about the end of the world.

77
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,037
The end of the world? Great.

78
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,497
How do we stop that?

79
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,584
With whatever we've got.

80
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,904
If this is all this world has to offer,

81
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,450
then it's only right
that I bring it to an end.

82
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,785
Starting with the humans.

83
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,414
Get down!

84
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,167
Marco!

85
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,338
We can't fight them both. Focus on Lektro.

86
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,902
On it, <i>bossing</i>.

87
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,737
I'm up for round two.

88
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,553
Surrender, Talagbusao, you're on your own.

89
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,640
Don't you understand, Trese?

90
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,476
This is all preordained.

91
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,102
Destined.

92
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,857
Like how you're standing
before me right now.

93
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,776
We're done listening to you.

94
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,570
Yeah. And don't think we're gonna
go easy because you're our dad.

95
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,739
We're more Mama's boys.

96
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:57,370
In that case, it's about time
you do as your father says.

97
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:07,588
The bond of power is strong,
but the bond of blood is stronger.

98
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,849
What have you done to them?

99
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,105
I've simply returned my children
to their true nature.

100
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,315
The same children you swore to kill?

101
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,027
You still think this is about them,

102
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,532
the prisoners, the Mayor,
the General, Nuno?

103
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:39,245
They were all a means
to a much greater end.

104
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:45,334
An end I meticulously planned
long before you were born.

105
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,924
<i>Despite your father's
best efforts to stop me,</i>

106
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,803
<i>he did not stem humanity's lust for war.</i>

107
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:05,396
<i>Their worship of blood and violence
is what ultimately drew</i>

108
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:11,861
<i>my most loyal subjects
to summon me back into your world.</i>

109
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:17,658
<i>I allowed my children to be taken
under your family's care,</i>

110
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,911
<i>so they could be my eyes and ears.</i>

111
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,540
Then I secretly whispered my biddings

112
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,169
throughout the corners
of the supernatural world

113
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:33,799
as I slowly built my army
in the shadows of your own city.

114
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,844
I hid myself in plain sight

115
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,766
and let my unwitting acolytes
leave bread crumbs in their wake.

116
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,186
Which ultimately led you here to me.

117
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,065
Now, it is time to fulfill your destiny,

118
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,527
to choose among the worthy
and pass judgment on this world.

119
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,073
This is the destiny
your father denied you.

120
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,743
"Destiny"? All you know is destruction.

121
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,788
Your father lied to you.

122
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,915
He lied to everyone.

123
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:15,925
<i>You are Alexandra Trese,
sixth child of the sixth child.</i>

124
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,887
<i>The one foretold to tip the balance
between the Underworld</i>

125
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,639
<i>and the world of men</i>

126
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,643
<i>to preside over one and destroy the other.</i>

127
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,397
<i>This is the prophecy
as told by your father,</i>

128
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,318
<i>but tainted instead
with lies and half-truths.</i>

129
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,949
<i>This prophecy has been
passed down through the ages</i>

130
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,618
<i>long before you were born.</i>

131
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:47,415
<i>But your father was the first
to seek to understand it.</i>

132
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,584
<i>His search led him to seven seers</i>

133
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,505
<i>who foresaw the coming
of the sixth child in this age.</i>

134
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,593
<i>One of the seers was a young babaylan
from Mount Makiling.</i>

135
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,432
<i>Your father studied
the babaylan's visions,</i>

136
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,727
<i>preparing for what they believed
to be the End Times.</i>

137
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,982
<i>The annihilation of both
the supernatural world</i>

138
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,234
<i>and the world of men.</i>

139
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,450
<i>For all
his scholarly posturing,</i>

140
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:26,620
<i>your father was blinded
by his own naive humanity.</i>

141
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,374
<i>His own sense of self-righteousness.</i>

142
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,252
<i>He thought he could stop
the march of fate,</i>

143
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,423
<i>even when he discovered
that the prophecy was much larger,</i>

144
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:41,343
<i>much grander than he ever imagined.</i>

145
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:48,309
<i>That is because the babaylan's visions
also spoke of a fifth child.</i>

146
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:54,899
<i>A fearsome warrior who would conquer
both worlds through death and fire</i>

147
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,860
<i>and lay them at the feet of the sixth.</i>

148
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:03,282
Then, I will be summoned
to remake the world.

149
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:07,203
And after the sixth
pass judgment on all of creation,

150
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,539
I, <i>Datu </i>Talagbusao, the God of War,

151
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,709
harbinger of both
destruction and creation,

152
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:18,756
lord of annihilation and rebirth,
would remake the world anew,

153
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,717
just as I had countless cycles before.

154
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,763
This is how it has been.
This is how it shall always be.

155
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:30,059
<i>But your self-righteous father
vowed to stop me</i>

156
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,770
<i>through whatever means necessary.</i>

157
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,648
<i>He realized that he could not do it alone.</i>

158
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:40,236
<i>So he formed the Council and united
the human and supernatural worlds</i>

159
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,196
<i>through his precious accords.</i>

160
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,282
<i>A fragile alliance
whose terms were dictated</i>

161
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,619
<i>by none other
than your sanctimonious father,</i>

162
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,080
<i>the self-appointed</i> lakan.

163
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,584
<i>He was reckless to think that his
tenuous accords would stop my arrival.</i>

164
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,672
<i>He lied to his allies and to himself</i>

165
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:04,218
<i>that he alone was the key
to putting an end to the prophecy.</i>

166
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:10,182
<i>He searched every corner of both worlds,
determined to find the prophesied twins.</i>

167
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,394
<i>He mistakenly believed
that by finding them,</i>

168
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,564
<i>he could stop the prophecy
from coming to fruition.</i>

169
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,776
<i>All the seers envisioned
the coming of these children.</i>

170
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,489
<i>But no one knew
to whom they would be born.</i>

171
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,285
<i>Not until the babaylan herself,
your mother,</i>

172
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,787
<i>became pregnant with twins,</i>

173
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,915
<i>you and your sister.</i>

174
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,919
<i>A fifth and a sixth child.</i>

175
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,631
<i>The first destined to conquer.</i>

176
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,135
<i>The other to bring balance.</i>

177
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,889
<i>They were confirmed
by the seers and your mother</i>

178
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:55,436
<i>to be the same prophesied children
that your father vowed to stop.</i>

179
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,564
<i>His own flesh and blood.</i>

180
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,777
<i>That was when he took matters
into his own hands.</i>

181
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,451
<i>He burned every trace, every note
he had ever made of the fifth child,</i>

182
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:14,663
<i>believing that if he could rid
the prophecy of its conqueror,</i>

183
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,833
<i>he would stop the coming of the end times,</i>

184
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,421
<i>even if it meant
sacrificing his own daughter.</i>

185
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,802
So...

186
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:35,351
he killed your sister
and turned her into this.

187
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,188
No, my sister was stillborn.

188
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,751
Your sister was destined

189
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,109
to be the greatest warrior
this world has ever seen.

190
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,530
Preordained to deliver
both worlds for your judgment,

191
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,533
which is why your father
feared her the most.

192
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:56,330
But your sister's death was nothing
but a bold-faced lie he spun,

193
00:15:56,413 --> 00:16:01,168
so he could shape you
into his own vision of the prophecy,

194
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,630
a lie he told to the Underworld as well.

195
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:09,927
So he could hide
your true identity from them.

196
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,976
The Balete Tree.

197
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:22,648
No one on the Council knew that you
were the sixth child of the sixth child.

198
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,945
<i>But when the truth was finally exposed,</i>

199
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:34,451
<i>those who opposed your father
confronted him on the day of your trials.</i>

200
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,961
Your position as <i>Lakan</i>
has made you arrogant, Trese,

201
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,757
surrender the child and there
will be no need for bloodshed.

202
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,095
You're a fool to think
that I'd simply hand over my daughter.

203
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,099
As long as she lives, she dooms us all.

204
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,686
Should the prophecy come to pass...

205
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,106
Then may we both
not live long enough to find out.

206
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,329
What now?

207
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,333
Kill them all.

208
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,003
No.

209
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,843
<i>Your father
was foolish enough to think</i>

210
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,596
<i>that he could twist the prophecy
to his own will</i>

211
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,517
<i>and cost the lives of the very allies
he swore to protect.</i>

212
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,813
<i>His own lies
began the undoing of the accords.</i>

213
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,650
<i>The same lies that lured you
into the Balete Tree</i>

214
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:54,073
<i>because he did not trust you
were ready to face your own destiny.</i>

215
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,285
<i>Innocent blood was spilled
for your father's lies,</i>

216
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,581
<i>all because he was too scared
to admit what he truly was.</i>

217
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,957
<i>Weak.</i>

218
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,134
Your father's weakness
was a death sentence

219
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,096
not only to your friends,
but to your family,

220
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,806
your sister, your mother.

221
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,225
His own hubris killed them all.

222
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,770
No! No! You're a liar.

223
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,358
Call me what you like,
but you cannot deny the truth.

224
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,819
I won't be manipulated by you.

225
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,321
Your father
is the manipulator.

226
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:38,200
He selfishly tried to control you
by raising you to believe

227
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,579
that you were born solely
to uphold his worthless accords.

228
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,624
So he robbed you of a choice, Alexandra.

229
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,545
He denied you the chance
to decide for yourself.

230
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:55,634
Instead, he chose for you and your sister
by controlling your fates,

231
00:18:55,717 --> 00:19:00,681
all because he did not trust you enough
with your own destiny.

232
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,308
And what makes you think I'll trust you?

233
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,187
You think your role in the prophecy
makes you special.

234
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,733
You are not
the first sixth child to be born,

235
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,819
nor will you be the last.

236
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:21,577
And now, my time has come
to once again begin the cycle anew.

237
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,997
Come, Trese, embrace your fate.

238
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,041
Bring judgment to this world,

239
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:34,214
so that I may destroy it and recreate
a new, stronger one in its wake.

240
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,675
It is your destiny.

241
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:40,429
This isn't destiny. This is genocide.

242
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:45,309
Your destiny is to stand
above all in existence.

243
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:51,106
The Aswang,
the <i>Tikbalang,</i> your friends, your family,

244
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,526
the human and the supernatural world.

245
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,238
You must choose among them all

246
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:03,994
and anoint those worthy
to be reborn in the New World.

247
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,623
You know I speak the truth.

248
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,293
You can feel it in your blood.

249
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,962
You have no idea what I believe.

250
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,340
Your father's fairy tales,

251
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,301
do you truly think that he loved you,

252
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,679
that he simply was not
using you all this time?

253
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,605
Don't listen to him, Alexandra.

254
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,901
Your father may not have been perfect,
but he was a good man.

255
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:42,532
And whatever he did, I will bet my life
that he did it to protect this world.

256
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,077
To protect you.

257
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,123
Captain Guerrero!

258
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:55,462
Ah, humanity, ever so arrogant.

259
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,466
And yet still so fragile.

260
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,145
Don't!

261
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,192
No!

262
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,120
He didn't deserve this.

263
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,164
He was a good man.

264
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,626
Why do you still resist?

265
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,756
Your father robbed your sister
of a choice by taking her life.

266
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,220
And he robbed you of your freedom
by controlling yours.

267
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,266
You are mistaken if you believe
that I'd choose to serve you.

268
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,604
Then I will decide for you.

269
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,027
Come and partake.

270
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,323
Embrace what you truly are.

271
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,327
What you've always known yourself to be.

272
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,623
Greater than man,
greater than your father.

273
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,879
<i>Sic itur ad astra.</i>

274
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:24,384
<i>Sic itur ad astra.</i>

275
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,863
It's time.

276
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,744
Papa, what if I'm not ready?

277
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,663
- What if I don't make it back?
- You will.

278
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,833
Trust in yourself just as I trust in you.

279
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,796
But should you ever lose your way...

280
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,049
...look to your family to lead you back.

281
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,708
We'll be right here
when you return, <i>bossing</i>.

282
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,016
It's time to forge
your own path, Alexandra.

283
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,979
Trust in yourself.
That will guide you to what is right.

284
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,730
But should you lose your way,

285
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,900
your family will always
be there beside you.

286
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,193
Always.

287
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,310
<i>Sic itur ad astra.</i>

288
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,813
<i>Sic itur ad astra.</i>

289
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,108
Are you ready to avenge your sister

290
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,987
and succeed where your father had failed?

291
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,616
No.

292
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:00,332
Because I am not my sister
and I am not my father.

293
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,963
But I am a Trese.

294
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,844
Any time, boys.

295
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,474
How can this be?

296
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:21,811
The bond of blood might be strong,
but the bond of the family is stronger.

297
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,420
- Hit him.
- Way ahead of you, <i>bossing</i>.

298
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,283
I hope
you've got a plan, <i>bossing</i>.

299
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,285
Keep him distracted and shoot around him.

300
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,787
Around him?

301
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,914
Remember that thing
that makes Crispin sick?

302
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,500
- I don't think...
- Trust me.

303
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,377
Always have, <i>bossing</i>.

304
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,148
Oh, yeah!

305
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,369
My flesh bleeds.

306
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,122
But my spirit is undying.

307
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,544
You cannot kill me!

308
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,174
I was never going to kill you.

309
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,181
Dragon's blood.

310
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,106
No! No!

311
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,649
Foolish girl!

312
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,943
I will not be imprisoned again!

313
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,695
It's done, Talagbusao.

314
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,613
Your schemes can't hurt anyone here.

315
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,991
Then you will be trapped here with me.

316
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,243
The prophecy cannot be stopped.

317
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:05,081
Destiny will come for you
and you will be forced to choose.

318
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,833
Then I choose this.

319
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:12,964
What?

320
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,509
No!

321
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:32,192
All that death just hurts, Papa.

322
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,570
Of course, it should.

323
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,368
<i>It is always painful
when something is lost.</i>

324
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,923
<i>You do what you can, Alexandra.</i>

325
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,093
That's the job, isn't it?

326
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:03,681
Alexandra, please. Help me save this one.

327
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,101
What?

328
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,437
You just reminded me
of your father for a moment.

329
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,025
Hey, I wanna try it.

330
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,152
I was first. You get the other one.

331
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,905
I said I wanna try it.

332
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,407
Give me.

333
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,658
Mine.

334
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,036
I still don't trust them.

335
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,704
Those two were raised to believe

336
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,207
that violence and murder
are games to be played.

337
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,335
We can show them
there's a better way to live

338
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,754
by giving them
what they need most right now.

339
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,964
What's that?

340
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,383
A real family.

341
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,345
Go, Team Trese.

342
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,974
Bring it in for Team Trese.

343
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,767
Team Trese, on three.

344
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,895
<i>Lead the way,</i> bossing.

345
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,690

Remember what your papa
and I always tell you.

348
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,701
You need to...

349
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,953
You need to see beyond the outside.

350
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:07,912
Correct.

351
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:12,333
All of us must see beyond
to live in balance.

352
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,253
I love you, my darling.

353
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,464
So very much.

354
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,966
Mom.

be there beside you.</i>

356
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,615
<i>Your family will always be there
beside you.</i>

357
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,263
