1
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,306
Tell us a story, Mama.

2
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,601
All right.

3
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,899
This is the story of the great
<i>Datu</i> Talagbusao.

4
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,862
The god of war.

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,535
Whose destiny was
to lift humanity from its depravity.

6
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,041
And usher it into a new era
where all could begin again.

7
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,093
Colonel Wilson Hidalgo.

8
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,599
Commanding officer of the Skeleton Crew.

9
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,019
You have proven yourself worthy
of the Talagbusao.

10
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,276
I hope you enjoy
the taste of their hearts.

11
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,361
I carved them out myself.

12
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:16,576
My men, you made me kill my men.

13
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,582
Just as you made me kill mine
all those years ago.

14
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>Did you find her?</i>

15
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,677
You were right, boss.

16
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,263
She's got all the fixings
for the blood ritual.

17
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,556
<i>Surround the place.</i>

18
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,268
But stay out of sight until we get there.

19
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,105
What is it, Papa?

20
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,984
The <i>Sigbin</i> will need our help.

21
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,278
We'll summon the War Council on the way.

22
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,364
Who do we want to call in?

23
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,866
Every last one of them.

24
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,869
He was a hero.

25
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:04,374
While men committed unspeakable acts
of evil against each other,

26
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,253
Talagbusao watched
for his true warriors to emerge.

27
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,923
Oh, is this the one
with the monkey and the turtle?

28
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,467
No, my darling.

29
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,721
This is the story
of your father and how we met.

30
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,229
He found me in the depths
of my rage and despair

31
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,858
and showed me
that I could give it purpose.

32
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,902
And he will show you yours
when he arrives.

33
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,029
When will he come, Mama?

34
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,781
Soon, my love.

35
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:41,286
In the meantime, why don't you
and your brother go outside to play?

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,053
<i>Dugo, digmaan, bangon, Talagbusao.</i>

37
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,180
<i>Dugo, digmaan, bangon, Talagbusao.</i>

38
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,142
<i>Dugo, digmaan, bangon, Talagbusao.</i>

39
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,352
<i>Dugo, digmaan, bangon, Talagbusao.</i>

40
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,813
I will kill...

41
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,441
<i>Dugo, digmaan, bangon, Talagbusao.</i>

42
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,110
<i>Dugo, digmaan, bangon, Talagbusao.</i>

43
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,280
<i>Dugo, digmaan, bangon, Talagbusao.</i>

44
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,964
<i>Dugo, digmaan, bangon, Talagbusao.</i>

45
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,331
My wife, how I've missed you.

46
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,339
Missed the taste of your blood.

47
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,174
Wait.

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,677
There is someone you should meet.

49
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,054
Twins!

50
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,890
That is even better.

51
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:30,937
More for me to devour.

52
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,358
I'm leaving
the Magna Mall clinic now.

53
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,152
Yes, with your medicine.

54
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,821
Okay, be there in about 20 minutes.

55
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,853
I know you're there...

56
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,316
Please! Please! No!

57
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,591
Hey!

58
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,053
Nobody touches Baby but me.

59
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,889
Hey!

60
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,183
That goes for you, too.

61
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:33,744
Victim's name is Dr. Petra Gallaga.

62
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:38,833
A dermatologist who runs a string
of successful clinics in various malls.

63
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:43,588
She's known for having a host
of celebrity clientele and endorsers.

64
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,257
My sister-in-law keeps telling me
to try her soap.

65
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,552
Why call me in?

66
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,854
This woman was clawed open
and chewed throughout her abdomen.

67
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,732
<i>Ibunyag ang nakatago.</i>

68
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,837
The attacker seems to have left a trail.

69
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,659
Leads to the sewers.

70
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,163
But the pipes are too small
for a person to fit through.

71
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,165
Unless it wasn't human.

72
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,960
What about the CCTV cameras?
Anything on them?

73
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,963
The owners of the mall
won't release them to us.

74
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,925
Probably afraid of a PR nightmare.

75
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,135
I wouldn't worry, Captain.

76
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,845
We've got this covered.

77
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,243
<i>Anino ng panginain, magpakita ka.</i>

78
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,162
Dude!

79
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,248
You could have just messaged me, you know?

80
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,209
Good evening, Jobert,
I need to call in a favor...

81
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,796
Yes! My mecha-<i>Tikbalang</i> just leveled up.

82
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,423
Dude, is that <i>Eternals 2.0?</i>

83
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,676
They aren't releasing that
until next year.

84
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,220
Please. This is <i>Eternals 4.</i>

85
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,932
I can see that you're busy.

86
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,268
But how about you show me the CCTV feed

87
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,937
from the Magna Mall parking area
from last night,

88
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,897
and I don't cut off your hand this time?

89
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,898
Okay, okay.

90
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,613
Can you freeze that?

91
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,575
She was on a call.

92
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,160
Her name is Dr. Petra Gallaga.

93
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,288
See if you can pull up
who she was talking to.

94
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,542
Okay. Got it.

95
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,588
It seems like Dr. Gallaga
was calling a "Maria Villarosa",

96
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,716
AKA, "Nova Aurora."

97
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,762
<i>The</i> Nova Aurora?

98
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,889
The... the Shining Star?

99
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,058
Box Office hottie of the moment.

100
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,103
Her last movie was so good
I saw it five times.

101
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,148
The guy she was dating, though.

102
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,025
They are just friends.

103
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,904
All she wants is to focus
on her latest movie and her charity work.

104
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,038
So what's the connection to Dr. Gallaga?

105
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,374
Further internet stalking shows

106
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,128
Dr. Gallaga is a childhood friend
of La Aurora

107
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,423
and president of her fan club,
the Novanians.

108
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,884
I suppose you'll want me to track
Nova Aurora's phone

109
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,594
to tell you where she is right now?

110
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,970
Send it to the boys

111
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,848
along with any other information
you can pull up.

112
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,103
Ugh.

113
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,105
This is going to give me nightmares.

114
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,042
It smells like durian.

115
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,669
Open the windows.

116
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,647
How does this thing work?

117
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,215
Try pulling it.

118
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,759
Basilio broke his.

119
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,636
You little shit!

120
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,471
Come here, you son of a bitch!

121
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,445
<i>I'll get it in five.</i>

122
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,738
Right this way.

123
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,333
Uh, Miss Nova will come see you
after she is done with the set up.

124
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,126
Thank you.

125
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:56,424
So why do you think Nova Aurora
is connected to the death of Dr. Gallaga?

126
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,634
She might not be.

127
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,887
But Dr. Gallaga was on a call to Nova
at the time of her murder.

128
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,140
So it's worth looking into.

129
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,396
- What is it, <i>bossing</i>?
- Don't move until I say so.

130
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,274
I know you're there.

131
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,540
Good evening, young Trese.

132
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:33,419
Not very many people
can be sure whether my people are hiding

133
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,297
among the flora and fauna.

134
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,965
Forgive us for barging in.

135
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,134
We did not know
that this was your dwelling.

136
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,844
Oh, please, <i>iha.</i>

137
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,640
I am Amang Paso,
elder of the tribe of the Red Earth.

138
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:51,353
You are in the dressing room
of my familiar, Nova Aurora.

139
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,232
I wasn't aware that the <i>duwende</i>
dabbled in showbiz.

140
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,154
Eh, what can I say?
I love all things beautiful.

141
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,282
Shepherding Nova
might be my best work yet.

142
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,996
Amang Paso,
it was on set calling out to me.

143
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,664
No one else could see it.

144
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,708
No one believes it's real.

145
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,587
It is all right, my dear,
you are safe here.

146
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,464
Please help her.

147
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,261
Miss Aurora, my name is Alexandra Trese.

148
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,180
Can you tell us what you saw on set?

149
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,520
Red eyes in the shadows
following my every move.

150
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,898
I... I can't take this.

151
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,733
I need my medicine.

152
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,236
Why hasn't Petra come?

153
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,405
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

154
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,033
but Dr. Petra Gallaga
was murdered last night.

155
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,678
We've come to see you
because you were the last person

156
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,787
she was in contact with.

157
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,163
No!

158
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,583
Well, she was fine when we spoke.

159
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,341
I'm sorry, but it might be best
if we go check what's out there right now.

160
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,010
Amang Paso, we will need your help.

161
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,429
Hank, you stay here with Miss Aurora.

162
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,642
I'm a fan.

163
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,355
Not a weird stalker-y one,
just a regular fan.

164
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,621
Do you know of anyone who would wish
to harm Nova or her friends?

165
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:37,418
When Nova got this part,
all the other actresses in town hated her.

166
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,547
I wouldn't put it past them
to hire someone to lay a curse on her.

167
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,507
There's a lot
of ground to cover.

168
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,844
Amang Paso, please take
the outside perimeter

169
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,763
with your <i>Laman Lupa</i>,
and we'll search the buildings.

170
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,534
This is all too much for my nerves.

171
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,705
Here, Maria. I mean, Nova.

172
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,790
Maybe this will make you feel better.

173
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,462
I haven't been called that in years.

174
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,714
My Grandma Nena made this by hand.

175
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,968
She used to embroider
my initials on everything.

176
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,805
My mother died when I was born,
so she raised me.

177
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,808
Your grandmother sounds like an okay lady.

178
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,019
Grandma is dead now.

179
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,231
But the words she used to whisper to me
every night at bedtime

180
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,902
helped me become who I am today...

181
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,820
...The Shining Star.

182
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,494
Oh, I'm so scared.

183
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,704
What if that creature comes here?

184
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,582
Okay, stay right here.

185
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,086
Lock the door and don't open it
until you hear my voice.

186
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,361
Anything from Jobert yet?

187
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,302
Signal is pretty bad here, <i>bossing</i>.

188
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,169
Nuno?

189
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,853
What are you doing here?

190
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:24,233
Word in the tunnels was that
there was a ruckus at the studio.

191
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,820
What else are they saying?
Any word on what we are dealing with here?

192
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,697
<i>Kulam</i> from a rival actress, perhaps?

193
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,075
That is a page from Amang Paso's playbook.

194
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,120
He'll do whatever it takes
for his familiars.

195
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,664
You met the guy, right?

196
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,041
That is not what is happening here.

197
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,960
I haven't seen it myself.

198
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:47,297
But you'll know what it is pretty quickly,
when you go by the vents.

199
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,301
It likes to make a nest
before it goes hunting.

200
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:57,599
Got to go before that stage <i>duwende</i>
finds me on his turf uninvited.

201
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,069
Jobert sent a video.

202
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,170
<i>Hank,
the creature is a</i> tiyanak.

203
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,925
Feral goblin that inhabits
small corpses left in the woods.

204
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,304
We think it killed Dr. Gallaga
and now it's after Nova. Is she with you?

205
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,810
She's in the bathroom.

206
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,145
I have to call you back.

207
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,775
Why would the <i>tiyanak</i> go after Nova?

208
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,069
It's a reanimated baby, Basilio.

209
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,196
Babies only want one thing.

210
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,364
Their mom.

211
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,339
Yes, I can hear you.

212
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,633
I'm coming for you.

213
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,639
Do you hear it calling for me?

214
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,436
I've heard that sound in my dreams.

215
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,817
Unless you want to turn this
into a nightmare,

216
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,819
we need to get out now.

217
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,784
He's here.

218
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,039
You are so kind to want to protect me.

219
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,294
But I think I know what it wants.

220
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,952
When I was a child, my Grandma Nena

221
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,955
would whisper these words
in my ear every night.

222
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,595
I didn't understand them then, but...

223
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,668
...seeing you here,

224
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,338
I do now.

225
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,804
You may have come from me,
but you are worthless.

226
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,016
And I want nothing to do with you.

227
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,898
Nova, don't!

228
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,652
Take that, Petra!

229
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,323
Couldn't even do the job right
when I had her leave you in the mountains.

230
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:47,204
Wasn't it enough that you
disfigured me for nine months,

231
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,208
and then clawed your way out of my body?

232
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,794
Oh, I've done my part.

233
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,880
I won't let you take from me anymore.

234
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,966
I won't! I won't!

235
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,176
Enough.

236
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,019
How was I? Not too much?

237
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,730
I just improvised that caress
at the last minute.

238
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,482
I think it worked.

239
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,196
And to think the critics said
I wasn't believable in my last movie.

240
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,964
You have
my many thanks, young Trese.

241
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,758
I think we shall all
sleep soundly tonight,

242
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,262
now that my beautiful Nova is safe.

243
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,223
My people will take care
of removing the remains.

244
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,600
Do not lay one finger on the <i>tiyanak</i>

245
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,270
unless you are prepared
to take the place of your familiar

246
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,397
and face the consequences for its death.

247
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,107
It was all in self-defense.

248
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,693
She was being hunted down by a monster.

249
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,697
It was a <i>tiyanak</i> who was only acting
on the instincts of its host.

250
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,286
<i>Stop! My hair is a mess.
Come hold this for me.</i>

251
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,082
<i>It's done.</i>

252
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,959
<i>Video proof like you requested, Nova.</i>

253
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,473
Your familiar left
a defenseless baby to the elements,

254
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,891
and then killed a <i>tiyanak.</i>

255
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,297
<i>All with no remorse.</i>

256
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,856
<i>Oh,</i> iha,
<i>how to explain this to you.</i>

257
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,860
<i>A child out of wedlock
would have killed her career.</i>

258
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,613
Don't you dare try to spin this.

259
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,822
We both know the truth.

260
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,159
She is the monster here
and you are the accomplice.

261
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,411
I have no tolerance for liars.

262
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,830
Do not cross my path again.

263
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,542
You should know, though,
that a tempest is brewing.

264
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,208
And there are liars
amongst your allies

265
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,422
who would conspire against you.

266
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,176
It would be prudent
to find out who they are...

267
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,471
before it is too late.

268
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,924
