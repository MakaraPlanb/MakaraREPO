1
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,899
This is the story of the great
Datu Talagbusao.

2
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,984
The <i>Sigbin</i> will need our help.

3
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,712
Yes! My mecha-<i>Tikbalang</i> just leveled up.

4
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,471
Come here, you son of a bitch!

5
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,559
What is it, bossing?

6
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,844
Oh, please, child.

7
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,232
I wasn't aware that the <i>duwende</i>
dabbled in showbiz.

8
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,844
Amang Paso, please take
the outside perimeter

9
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:47,928
with your <i>Laman Lupa</i>,

10
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,763
and we'll search the buildings.

11
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,714
My grandma Nena made this by hand.

12
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,019
Grandma is dead now.

13
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,302
Signal is pretty bad here, bossing.

14
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,697
<i>Kulam</i> from a rival actress, perhaps?

15
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:57,850
Got to go before that stage <i>duwende</i>
finds me on his turf uninvited.

16
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,170
<i>Hank, the creature is a</i> tiyanak.

17
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,775
Why would the <i>tiyanak</i> go after Nova?

18
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,994
When I was a child, my Grandma Nena

19
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,330
would whisper these words
in my ear every night.

20
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,600
Do not lay one finger on the <i>tiyanak.</i>

21
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,780
It was a <i>tiyanak</i> who was only acting
on the instincts of its host.

22
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,891
And then killed a <i>tiyanak.</i>

23
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,856
<i>Oh, child. How to explain this to you.</i>
