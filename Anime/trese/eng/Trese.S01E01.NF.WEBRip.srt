1
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,125
Third break down this month.

2
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,878
- Let's just walk back...
- Hi, sorry, Min.

3
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,796
Not the best way to spend your birthday.

4
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,214
It's fine.

5
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,092
I'd rather be home
watching my dramas anyway.

6
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,221
Hey, shouldn't we go with the crowd?

7
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,641
Look, there's someone up ahead.

8
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:44,873
<i>Manila, she'll welcome you
with smiles as warm as the sun.</i>

9
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,128
<i>When the sun sets,
take a turn down a dark alley...</i>

10
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,506
<i>and you might find yourself as prey.</i>

11
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,177
<i>Kidnappers and thieves
are the least of your worries.</i>

12
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,931
<i>Beware the ones that crave your blood
and covet your soul.</i>

13
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,352
<i>They can't be bound by handcuffs.</i>

14
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,108
<i>My father used to say,
"Leave the shadows be.</i>

15
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,403
<i>Light will be there
to maintain the balance."</i>

16
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,781
<i>Night has taken this city.</i>

17
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,160
<i>The shadows have grown darker.</i>

18
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,455
<i>The treaty that has kept the humans safe</i>

19
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,584
<i>from the supernatural Underworld
has begun to unravel.</i>

20
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:37,508
<i>Good people keep trying to fight back,
but the dark forces are getting stronger.</i>

21
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:42,138
<i>There is no light
to keep the shadows in check.</i>

22
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,434
<i>There is only me.</i>

23
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,244
Good evening, Captain Guerrero.

24
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,039
Hello, Alexandra. Thanks for coming down.

25
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,708
I had a feeling
you might want to see this.

26
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,878
I admit, I was curious
when you described the circumstances.

27
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,047
So, is it...

28
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,341
The White Lady of Balete Drive.

29
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,635
Any witnesses, Lt. Tapia?

30
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,719
No, ma'am.

31
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,599
But one of the neighbors positively
ID'd the victim as "Gina Santos."

32
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,269
We checked it, and it turns out
she committed suicide in...

33
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,312
"...1995."

34
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,606
Wait, that can't be right.

35
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,900
Ancient runes crudely done.

36
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,069
Clearly ritual sacrifice.

37
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,573
The bigger question is,
who would want to kill a ghost and why?

38
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,753
Death is nothing
to be afraid of, Alexandra.

39
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,592
It is not an end, but a rebirth
to another plane of existence.

40
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,308
There was a time when magic in the world
was a natural part of life.

41
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,519
That age has passed.

42
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,730
People fear what they don't understand.

43
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,526
That's why our family has always been
the bridge between mankind

44
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,403
and the supernatural.

45
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:28,202
Your father might be the <i>lakan</i>
and protector of the accords,

46
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,330
but I know a few things.

47
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,583
When a soul gets lost...

48
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,961
...we, babaylan, have the power to help.

49
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,509
Tapia, get SOCO to gather
the evidence before it blows away.

50
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,152
Yes, Cap!

51
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,516
What?

52
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,437
You just reminded me of your father
for a moment.

53
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,608
Anton was usually the only one
with a clue in a case like this.

54
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,069
But now that he's gone...

55
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,781
well, now we have you, Alexandra.

56
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,119
There are a few places
to acquire magic this strong.

57
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,870
But I know where to start looking.

58
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,581
I have friends in low places.

59
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,227
<i>Tabi-tabi po.</i>

60
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,211
I need to see your master.

61
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,610
I have some questions for him.

62
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,519
Psst!

63
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,323
Down, boy. She's on the level.

64
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,994
Greetings, young Trese.

65
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,121
Good evening, Nuno.

66
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,373
I can always count on you for the dirt.

67
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,710
Nuno sees nothing and hears nothing.

68
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,003
I just...

69
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,717
What do you know about the White Lady?

70
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,635
Okay, okay.

71
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,346
Last week, she was crowing
about how her lover

72
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,140
was going to make her a queen

73
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,602
if she helped close a deal
with an aswang clan.

74
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:02,732
Then I hear whispers in the tunnels
that somebody put a hit out on her.

75
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,815
Aswang?

76
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,902
What did they want with her?

77
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:11,616
If you want a seat at their table,
the buy-in is a sacrifice.

78
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,535
That dizzy dame thought
she was going to be a player.

79
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,999
But she ended up as the chips.

80
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,419
I need to find out which clan
made the pact, and then with whom.

81
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:28,299
Oh, you'll know the crew
from the poison they used.

82
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,888
For a bite of that,
I could tell you what it is.

83
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,021
Well?

84
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,233
Ground mermaid bones.

85
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:50,279
Surefire way to trap a ghost
in the earthly plane and kill it.

86
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,823
The aswang pack
that controls the pier

87
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,825
are the only ones who have it.

88
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,955
But you didn't hear that from me.

89
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,916
Nobody likes a snitch.

90
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,252
A pleasure doing business
with you, as always.

91
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,758
Boys, time to go hunting.

92
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,152
Hey! No humans allowed.

93
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,071
Your kind is not welcome here.

94
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,296
Hey!

95
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,507
The only way you can get in...

96
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,011
Greetings, Ibwa, Chief of the Sapa Clan.

97
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,721
I am Alexandra Trese.

98
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,351
The aswang clan signed
the accords with my father,

99
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,813
and you are bound by those rules
to cooperate with my investigation

100
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,940
or face the consequences.

101
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,484
This son of a bitch.

102
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,362
You come to my turf, and threaten me?

103
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,241
Only I make the rules around here, bitch.

104
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,076
End her!

105
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,171
Ha!

106
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,044
Tell them to go away

107
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,351
or I swear you'll have taken
your last breath.

108
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,395
Do what she says.

109
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,879
- We'll be right outside.
- Yes, Chief.

110
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,484
Who did you give the mermaid bones to?

111
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,443
Screw you.

112
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,657
The accords dictate
that I should give you a warning

113
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,909
for obstructing an investigation.

114
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,370
No.

115
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,084
Consider yourself warned.

116
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,299
Is that an aswang eye?

117
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,842
That's pretty badass.

118
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,637
I need the water in the glass, please.

119
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,097
Thirsty, bossing?

120
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,142
I want to see what kind of creature
of darkness we're dealing with here.

121
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:33,734
<i>Sa mata ng iba, mga lihim magpapakita.</i>

122
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,579
Are you calling

123
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,123
that fire monster again, Mama?

124
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,710
His face can be a little scary,
but he is not a monster.

125
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,880
He is the Great Spirit
of the Binondo Fire,

126
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,799
and we must show him respect.

127
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,136
Remember what your papa
and I always tell you.

128
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,680
- You need to...
- You need to see beyond the outside.

129
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,682
Correct.

130
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,894
All of us must see beyond
to live in balance.

131
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,564
Give me your hand.

132
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,537
Anton, how was the council meeting?

133
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,458
I knew they would side with you.

134
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,918
Now stay in the city. We're fine.

135
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,129
We'll see you later...

136
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,256
Hello?

137
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,475
My love, it's time to play
that game I taught you, okay?

138
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,853
Remember where Papa and I
showed you how to hide?

139
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,191
I want you to go there
and don't come out until I call.

140
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,274
Okay, Mama.

141
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,403
<i>Maria Makiling, diwata ng bundok,</i>

142
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,906
<i>pagpalain niyo kami.</i>

143
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,201
Stay as quiet as you can

144
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,952
and keep Sinag close.

145
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:12,249
Whatever happens,
remember to see beyond the outside.

146
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,586
I love you, my darling.

147
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,007
So very much.

148
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,843
Now, go.

149
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,360
Hello, Captain Guerrero.

150
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,116
Crimes like these
cannot wait for due process.

151
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:51,455
I promise to find
and punish the guilty myself.

152
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,768
- This is why the people elected me.
- No rest for the wicked, Captain.

153
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,043
Tell me about it.

154
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,629
We may need you on this one, too.

155
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,550
Doesn't help that I got a circus
trampling on my crime scene.

156
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,927
...and why they will do so again!

157
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,929
Yeah!

158
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,059
Mayor Santamaria's office got wind of it.

159
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,603
And now, he wants to take over.

160
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,730
God, I love election time.

161
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,278
He might be trying to cover
something up rather than solve it.

162
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,785
Mayor Santamaria isn't someone
you can go up against, Alexandra.

163
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,121
He's got backers rich enough
to keep him in office

164
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,499
and powerful enough
to make his critics disappear.

165
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,295
Gina Santos,
the White Lady of Balete Drive,

166
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,463
was his mistress when she killed herself.

167
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,301
He sacrificed her ghost
to gain favor with the aswang.

168
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,887
If he's aligning with them,
I need to know why.

169
00:14:55,477 --> 00:15:00,316
Vote for Mayor Santamaria.
Reelect a man who cares for the people.

170
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,693
Hoy!

171
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,659
Do I know you?

172
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,828
We have a mutual acquaintance.

173
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,414
Ibwa tells me you took
some mermaid bones from him.

174
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,710
He runs a bad crew, Mr. Mayor.

175
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,588
You're better off coming clean
for the murder of Gina Santos

176
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,714
than dealing with them.

177
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,385
What a wild imagination you have
for such a pretty face.

178
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,349
But if you're going to accuse me
of something that serious,

179
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,476
you'd better have proof.

180
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,528
I have important work to do
for my constituents.

181
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,449
I don't have time for fairy tales
of aswang and mermaids.

182
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,536
I never said anything
about aswang, Mr. Mayor.

183
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,856
Apparently, the train broke down
over the Guadalupe Bridge.

184
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,611
Service crew found it like this,
lots of blood, no bodies,

185
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,155
and a pile of missing persons reports.

186
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,784
Do you smell something burning?

187
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,329
No.

188
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,916
There was a fire
at the squatters area nearby.

189
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,793
But that was two nights ago.

190
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,421
We're still trying
to locate those residents.

191
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,381
They seem to have vanished.

192
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,464
I see.

193
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,259
Will you excuse me, Captain?

194
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,137
I would like the car to myself, please.

195
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,480
Good evening, little Trese.

196
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,816
What game shall we play today?

197
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,110
Greetings, Great Santelmo.

198
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,653
I'm afraid this is business,

199
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,989
and I need your help
to uncover what happened.

200
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,074
Well, you're no fun.

201
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,832
The souls who were killed
in this car are here,

202
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,377
yet, they are not, and they are not alone.

203
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,591
I sense spirits on fire.

204
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,802
People who had burned
to death in their sleep.

205
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,139
They, too, are making the journey.

206
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,726
How can the souls be here
and yet not be here?

207
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,396
We are standing in two trains right now.

208
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,440
One for the living...

209
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,233
And the other for the dead.

210
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,403
Thank you, Santelmo.
May the great light shone upon you.

211
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,159
<i>Mga kaluluwa, saan kayo papunta?</i>

212
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:02,164
<i>Ako'y makikiraan,
kaya pakibuksan ang pintuan.</i>

213
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,685
Ibu, Goddess of Death,

214
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,979
sends her greetings to you...

215
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,357
<i>...Lakan</i> of humanity.

216
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,069
Emissary, since when does Ibu use the MRT

217
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,238
to ferry the souls of the dead?

218
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,783
The train follows the original pathways.

219
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,246
The most efficient way to the Afterworld.

220
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,459
It wasn't in the original agreement
with your father,

221
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,003
but she formally asks that you,

222
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,966
as the current <i>lakan</i>
and enforcer of the accords,

223
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,760
consider her request to use it.

224
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,889
I will allow it, but in return,
I need a favor.

225
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,226
Tell me where
those three girls died and how.

226
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,857
They were hunted down
by a clan of aswang on these tracks.

227
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,904
Taken to the tribe's lair,
where they met their demise

228
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,908
and their souls found
their way back to Ibu's train.

229
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,119
They were not the only ones.

230
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,788
Show me where they were killed.

231
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,125
As you wish.

232
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,239
Wait for my signal.

233
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,224
You got it, <i>bossing.</i>
We'll be ready when you need us.

234
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,484
Please help me.

235
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,861
They took my daughter.

236
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,953
Mark the soul as ours
before it flies away.

237
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,788
Or Xa-Mul will kill us.

238
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,624
The souls are worth more than the meat.

239
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,251
Hold still, you brat!

240
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,679
It's all right. You're safe now.

241
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,763
Trese!

242
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,436
I know you're in there with our food.

243
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,816
I could smell your stench
from a mile away.

244
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,111
Stay close.

245
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,238
Don't be rude.

246
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,034
Come out and join the party.

247
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,160
Trese!

248
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,002
It's not a party when your guests
are here against their will, Xa-Mul.

249
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,338
- The accords...
- Don't apply here.

250
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,216
Not after what you did to Ibwa.

251
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,347
Those humans were a payment
and ours to do with as we please.

252
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,182
Take the girl!

253
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,143
If the <i>lakan</i> gets in the way...

254
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,770
kill her.

255
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,476
Kill her.

256
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,533
Walk away, Trese.

257
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,870
And maybe I'll let this offense slide.

258
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,274
It was <i>Kuya</i> Crispin,
who disobeyed your order to wait.

259
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,259
Couldn't let you have
all the fun this time, <i>bossing.</i>

260
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,262
It's okay.

261
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,059
Oh, and we freed
the people in the back.

262
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,268
Cover me.

263
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,772
Mother!

264
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,274
My baby.

265
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,653
Thank you. You saved my baby.

266
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,156
Can you tell us what happened?

267
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,412
A group of us had survived the fire
in Guadalupe but lost everything.

268
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,918
<i>Mayor Santamaria's men came
and offered to pay for our relocation.</i>

269
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,673
They had been trying to get us
to move even before the fire.

270
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,010
<i>We all knew he was making
a deal to build condos,</i>

271
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,013
<i>so we wanted to hold out
for a better price.</i>

272
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,432
<i>But now,</i>

273
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,475
<i>there was no choice.</i>

274
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,020
At first, it was good.

275
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,565
<i>We had a clean place
to stay and they fed us.</i>

276
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,819
<i>The mayor himself came and promised
that he would take care of everything.</i>

277
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,071
<i>Then, night fell.</i>

278
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,032
The aswang.

279
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,618
<i>They came for us while we slept.</i>

280
00:24:54,701 --> 00:25:00,248
<i>They dragged us away and kept us in cages.
And we weren't the only ones.</i>

281
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,876
<i>Every day, they brought groups of people.</i>

282
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,795
<i>Like us, they were taken
in the dark of night</i>

283
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,006
<i>where nobody would miss us.</i>

284
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:12,510
<i>From broken down trains
to squatters area set on fire,</i>

285
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,388
<i>all of us powerless
to do anything but wait.</i>

286
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,392
<i>We could hear the feasting
and screams through the walls.</i>

287
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,440
I saw the Mayor in the kitchen
talking to the aswang.

288
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,859
<i>Renegotiating their deal.</i>

289
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,028
<i>He promised he would cover up
their train raid</i>

290
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,614
<i>and burn more settlements
for their food supply.</i>

291
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,577
<i>We called out to him for help,
but he ignored us.</i>

292
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,163
<i>Once he got what he wanted,
we were nothing to him.</i>

293
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,415
Ah, we may not be able

294
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,044
to arrest Mayor Santamaria
for making deals with the aswang,

295
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,964
but we got him
on human trafficking, arson,

296
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,841
and the murder of his mistress,
Gina Santos.

297
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,094
You okay?

298
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,058
There are monsters among us,
and some of them human.

299
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,686
I should have gotten there
sooner to save the others.

300
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,981
But look at all the people you saved.

301
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,530
<i>Alexandra.</i>

302
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,166
Alexandra?

303
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,670
Alexandra.

304
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,098
It's all right, little one.

305
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,641
You're safe with Papa.

306
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,693
Those aswang scum will pay for this.

307
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,778
Mama.

308
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,597
Rough night, huh, <i>bossing</i>?

309
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,725
No more than usual, Hank.

310
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,312
<i>Mayor Sancho Santamaria
was arrested this morning</i>

311
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,857
<i>on several dozen counts
of murder and corruption</i>

312
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,151
<i>connected with the fire at Guadalupe.</i>

313
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,674
<i>According to our sources,</i>

314
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,238
<i>there is also new evidence
linking the Mayor</i>

315
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,742
<i>to the death of his alleged mistress,
Gina Santos.</i>

316
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:45,038
<i>What was reported as a suicide
is now believed to be a murder.</i>

317
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,457
What is it?

318
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:52,379
I bring a peace offering
from Ibu for your arsenal.

319
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:57,175
She hopes the <i>lakan</i>
has forgiven her mistake.

320
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,303
The Goddess of Death hardly needs
to worry about offending anyone.

321
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,766
When the sixth child of the sixth child

322
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,770
takes her rightful place
as ruler of the Underworld,

323
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,815
as was foretold by the prophecy,

324
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,985
the Court of Death would like
to be in her good graces.

325
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,530
That's not me.

326
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,865
But you may tell Ibu that we are good.

327
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,909
For now.

328
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,515
