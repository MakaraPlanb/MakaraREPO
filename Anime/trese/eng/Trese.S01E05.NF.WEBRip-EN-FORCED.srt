1
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,534
Let us see what the <i>Lakan</i> has to say.

2
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,916
- The <i>Lakan</i> speaks true.
- Ever the smooth fucker.

3
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,920
Perhaps there is merit
in the <i>Lakan's</i> words.

4
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,704
I accept the <i>Lakan's</i> offer.

5
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,887
<i>And the</i> higante <i>armory.</i>

6
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,770
Señor Armanaz wishes to inform the <i>Lakan</i>

7
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,648
that the council has met
and made their decision.

8
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,502
I get that and I'm with you there, <i>Lakan.</i>

9
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,609
May the tribe of the <i>Tikbalang</i>
continue to walk in <i>Bathala's</i> light.

10
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,909
And while the <i>Tikbalang</i>
can't officially say,

11
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,494
we will continue to support you.

12
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:30,278
Jesus, bossing.
You look worse than I feel.

13
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,741
<i>Kulam.</i>

14
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,344
The <i>babaylan-mandirigma.</i>
Healer and warrior.

15
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,478
Not the best odds, bossing.

16
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,384
Tikbalang <i>hair.</i>

17
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,974
It's nothing personal, <i>Lakan,</i>
just revenge.

18
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,184
Hard to get a clean shot, bossing.

19
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,491
and make those <i>Laman Lupa</i>
put up those shields.

20
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,166
Close call, bossing.

21
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,314
- We have...
- Bossing, we just won.
