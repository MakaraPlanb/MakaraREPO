1
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,273
Let me know if they try anything.

2
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,534
Let us see
what the <i>lakan</i> has to say.

3
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,619
But they are children.

4
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,706
Once again, you put all of us in jeopardy,

5
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,084
so you can assume
some sort of moral high ground, Anton.

6
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,503
I was under the impression

7
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,089
that the accords were set up
to protect us.

8
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:52,927
If we cast out the innocent,
we set ourselves down the path to ruin

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,263
toward the outcome we all dread.

10
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:59,893
The children of Talagbusao
can hardly be considered innocent.

11
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:04,272
We aswang aren't part of this Council
to soothe our conscience.

12
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,275
Tell me if our purpose has changed.

13
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:11,321
The tribes and I will gladly leave
this little club if so.

14
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,491
The accords are in place
not only for our protection,

15
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,785
but for peace and order.

16
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,662
A better world for our children.

17
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,975
- The <i>Lakan</i> speaks the truth.
- Ever the smooth fucker.

18
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,920
Perhaps there is merit
in the <i>Lakan</i>'s words.

19
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,381
Better to simply wipe the blood
from the blade

20
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,342
than to go to war without.

21
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,802
True.

22
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:38,097
It would do us good to fight fire
with fire if the God of War returns.

23
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,351
"If"? More like when.

24
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:46,606
We need to tie up all these loose ends
before that happens.

25
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,651
I will take responsibility for them.

26
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,570
The moment that those two
pose a threat to our safety,

27
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,447
I will put them down myself.

28
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,492
Surely this is acceptable to you all.

29
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,704
I accept the <i>Lakan's</i> offer.

30
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,500
As do I.

31
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,044
Then it is settled.

32
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,964
May we all be in balance.

33
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,385
May we all be in balance.

34
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,641
It wasn't their fault, Alex.

35
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,185
I still don't trust them.

36
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,404
Those two were raised to believe
that violence and murder

37
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,197
are games to be played.

38
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,992
We can show them
there is a better way to live

39
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,911
by giving them
what they need most right now.

40
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,204
What's that?

41
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,373
A real family.

42
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,003
They will be guided by these.

43
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,675
All that death just hurts, Papa.

44
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,344
Of course, it should.

45
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,389
It is always painful
when something is lost.

46
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,443
But it is that same pain
that reminds us of what is at stake,

47
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,779
not just for us,
but for everyone we protect.

48
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,160
Now, go on. It is late.

49
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,564
Do you believe in second chances?

50
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,651
Before I came to this place, I didn't.

51
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,991
I thought it was the end of the line
when they caught me.

52
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,328
Someone or something
was going to get me in here.

53
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,415
Before that could happen,

54
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,250
someone found me first

55
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,671
and granted me the means to change myself.

56
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:45,386
In doing so, that made me realize
it must be broken down and rebuilt.

57
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,307
That's what I want to give to you.

58
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,351
The means to change yourself.

59
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,229
A second chance.

60
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,034
<i>Sic itur ad astra.</i>

61
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,895
<i>Sic itur ad astra.</i>

62
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,192
<i>...Manila remains under a state of emergency</i>

63
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,403
<i>as several more explosions
have rocked the city this week.</i>

64
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,287
<i>After taking credit
for the attacks</i>

65
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,325
<i>and inciting the ongoing riots
at the New Bilibid Prison,</i>

66
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,828
<i>Mayor Sancho Santamaria's
recent statement</i>

67
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,413
<i>has left citizens
fearful for their safety.</i>

68
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,000
<i>These first
few attacks are only the beginning.</i>

69
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,711
<i>A demonstration of our power.</i>

70
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,839
<i>More buildings will fall.</i>

71
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,799
<i>More lives will be lost.</i>

72
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:10,138
<i>It is only when we have lost everything
that we can truly begin anew as a country.</i>

73
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,683
<i>To forge a new and brighter destiny.</i>

74
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,726
<i>Change is coming.</i>

75
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,689
<i>Our ascent to the stars
cannot to be stopped.</i>

76
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,859
<i>Sic itur ad astra.</i>

77
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,153
<i>In light of these events...</i>

78
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,655
At least now we know
who to blame for this mess.

79
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,784
Aww, you think you can
actually take me on?

80
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,994
Cute.

81
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,789
I don't have time for your games, Maliksi.
Say what you need to say.

82
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,169
My father sends his regards and a message.

83
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,173
The human bombers have hit
many of the tribes' places of power.

84
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,049
<i>The Armanaz building,</i>

85
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,051
<i>the aswang market,</i>

86
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,887
<i>and the</i> higante <i>armory.</i>

87
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472
<i>Mayor Santamaria</i>

88
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,433
has effectively declared humanity
an enemy of the Council.

89
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,770
Señor Armanaz wishes to inform the <i>Lakan</i>

90
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,648
that the Council has met
and made their decision.

91
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,235
The accords will no longer be honored.

92
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,905
The tribes must keep
the peace as they see fit.

93
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,450
By casting aside humanity?
By standing apart?

94
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,535
And the attacks were on both sides.

95
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,412
There's something bigger going on here.

96
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,290
And if we all want to survive,
the tribes need to be united.

97
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,502
I get that and I'm with you there, <i>Lakan.</i>

98
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,504
But my father was outvoted.

99
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,380
It's getting worse and worse.

100
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,925
They're even targeting the minor players
from the Underworld.

101
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,801
Jobert's place was just hit.

102
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,928
He's fine.

103
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,722
You can't kill a ghost.

104
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,643
It's really every tribe
for themselves now.

105
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,937
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,481
Thank you for the message.

107
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,609
May the tribe of the <i>Tikbalang</i>
continue to walk in <i>Bathala</i>'s light.

108
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,571
If anyone else from the Underworld
still owes you a favor,

109
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,406
I'd call them in now.

110
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,909
And while the <i>Tikbalang</i>
can't officially say,

111
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,494
we will continue to support you.

112
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,913
I won't tell if you won't.

113
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:30,278
Jesus, <i>bossing</i>,
you look worse than I feel.

114
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,615
I think Amang Paso's dead.

115
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,578
He sacrificed himself to put up a barrier.

116
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,538
He was telling me that...

117
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:44,584
It was Mayor Santamaria!
He's the guy pulling the strings.

118
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,711
Take it easy, Hank. Everyone knows.

119
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,006
I'm just sick and tired
of being the last one that does.

120
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,384
Do you remember anything about the bomber?

121
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,012
It's a blur.

122
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,599
He said that weird phrase. What was it?

123
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,059
Secure... sad bastard?

124
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,478
<i>Sic itur ad astra.</i>

125
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,147
"This way to the stars."

126
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,399
Anything else?

127
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,526
His eyes were weird.

128
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,196
They didn't look natural.

129
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,615
Like they were white.

130
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,741
<i>Kulam.</i>

131
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,904
It's not the first time Mayor Santamaria

132
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,536
has used black magic.

133
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,954
<i>The mermaid bones.</i>

134
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,040
<i>His deals with the aswang.</i>

135
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,792
<i>Someone's always backing his play.</i>

136
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,254
We get to the Mayor,
we'll know who that is,

137
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,299
then we find out
why all of this has been happening.

138
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,259
Oh, shit.

139
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,511
Let me get the car,
so we can ice this bastard...

140
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,972
Rest up, Hank.

141
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,377
It'll be a while
before the spell fixes you up.

142
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,936
I'm going to end this.

143
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,066
There! You see?

144
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,234
There!

145
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,782
And you're all standing in the latest one.

146
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,415
I'm glad you got me all this
temporary equipment for this little caper,

147
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,086
but would it have killed you
to get me a faster data plan?

148
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,129
Can I see the last one again?

149
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,472
That's one
of the missing prisoners.

150
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,387
Two to one, if I check
on the rest of these men.

151
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,430
They'll all be from the prison.

152
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,183
What the hell are we dealing with?

153
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,227
Magic, Captain.

154
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,105
Far stronger than I would give
Mayor Santamaria credit for.

155
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,191
So it's pretty bad, then.

156
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,901
Figures.

157
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,922
Well, at least we know the bombers
are coming from the prison.

158
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,490
But they keep getting past
the military perimeter.

159
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,618
Whatever defense they have set up,
it isn't good enough.

160
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,496
General Villar is the one in charge of it.

161
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,915
He's old-school and by the book.

162
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,668
Marco just got assigned to his staff.

163
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,794
I'll give him a call.

164
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,712
We'll meet you there.

165
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,507
I'm gonna take a friend's advice
and call in some favors.

166
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,887
This feels off, Alexandra. Are we ready?

167
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,059
<i>Can you hear me, Alexandra?</i>

168
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,940
Are you ready?

169
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,697
What if I fail?

170
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:25,411
Our lineage has a stand in between
the world of man and the supernatural.

171
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,956
But only when we have proven
ourselves worthy

172
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,917
by facing the trials
at the Great Balete Tree.

173
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,421
I don't feel ready.

174
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,716
You are the sixth child
of the sixth child,

175
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,593
the <i>babaylan-mandirigma.</i>

176
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,636
Healer and warrior.

177
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,432
You were born ready.

178
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,559
I wish I could go in with you.

179
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,228
She will have to do.

180
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,022
"She"?

181
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,526
Sinag.

182
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,947
She's your twin, Alexandra.

183
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,034
I don't understand.

184
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,786
You told me my twin died at childbirth.

185
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,873
In a way.

186
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,667
I did everything we could
to save your sister.

187
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,670
Forging that blade meant

188
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,883
that a part of her would always stay
and watch over our family.

189
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,679
Why are you telling me this now
when the trials are hours away?

190
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,307
This is when you need
your family the most.

191
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,643
The trials may seem daunting.

192
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,063
But with Sinag,
you won't be facing them alone.

193
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,942
She will always be there beside you.

194
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,613
Your family will always
be there beside you.

195
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,365
Anton!

196
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,297
Hold fast.

197
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,215
Remember why we are here.

198
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,069
I knew it.
I knew you were still alive.

199
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,740
I never stopped believing,
not even for a second.

200
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,283
How long have I been gone?

201
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,788
Five years.

202
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,125
Felt like a hundred.

203
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,130
Where's Papa?

204
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,220
He died protecting you.

205
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,472
We held the line at the tree.

206
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,391
Not all of us survived.

207
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,936
There are so many things
that I didn't get to say.

208
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,064
I never even told him that...

209
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,482
that...

210
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,694
Not that I'm ungrateful
for the back-up, ma'am,

211
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,405
uh, but I was hoping
for a lot more than magic.

212
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,532
I had hoped that after
we rescued your friends,

213
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,492
you'd have a little more faith in magic.

214
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,869
No offense, ma'am.

215
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,632
You serve long enough, you learn to trust.

216
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,622
- But it's important to verify.
- Sir, we shall stop to bust out some grub.

217
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,460
Good to know I have your trust.

218
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,714
General Villar is a stubborn one.

219
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,009
I can be very convincing.

220
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,594
The Mayor's got

221
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,637
all the disposable bombers he needs.

222
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,306
If I don't go in there and stop him,

223
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,641
he will make good
on all of his insane threats.

224
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,603
You expect me to let you walk in there

225
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,773
because the Mayor has been
controlling the prisoners with magic?

226
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,067
Black magic, to be exact.

227
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,071
White magic respects free will.
Black magic enslaves it.

228
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,994
If you go in, you go in
with military escort,

229
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,330
and you answer to us.

230
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,166
Too many eyes on this thing
for me to make a mistake.

231
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,460
This is bigger than all of us, General.

232
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,129
I'm going in there with or without you.

233
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,563
Oh, my god.

234
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,609
My professional assessment,
shit hit the fan.

235
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:41,615
Let all those
who still doubt fear our retribution.

236
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,870
The winds of change
have finally blown in our favor.

237
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,289
Today, we burn down Malacañang.

238
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,960
Tomorrow, everything else.

239
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,629
Incoming.
I want suppressing fire now.

240
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,215
<i>Sic itur ad astra.</i>

241
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,883
Get down!

242
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,814
All units, take down that son of a bitch.

243
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,123
What the hell are you all waiting for?

244
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,797
Take cover.

245
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,478
Not the best odds, <i>bossing.</i>

246
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,106
We can totally take them.

247
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,357
I think.

248
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,152
I don't have it in me to shoot
any of our people.

249
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,862
Isn't there anything we can do for them?

250
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,030
We have to end this quick.

251
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,115
We take the Mayor down,
we dispel the possession.

252
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,617
Non-lethal shots, then.
This isn't going to be easy.

253
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,912
It's the job. Cover me and try not to die.

254
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,372
Come on, boys.

255
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,797
Is it always like this with her?

256
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,508
Pretty much.

257
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,854
Free the men now.

258
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:40,776
Those men are free,
as you will all soon be.

259
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,072
Had you not exposed me
and sent me to prison,

260
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,158
I would have never met my benefactor.

261
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,368
Seems like a real nice guy.

262
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,579
Scoff if you must.

263
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:56,458
I made myself anew in prison.
Thanks to him.

264
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,128
This change would not come
overnight, though.

265
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,715
I needed a few items
to make things permanent.

266
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,384
Tikbalang <i>hair.</i>

267
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,929
<i>The ashes of a god.</i>

268
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,765
<i>The bones of the innocent.</i>

269
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,851
<i>The tears of a sinner.</i>

270
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:19,648
All ingredients to give me
the power I have now.

271
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,652
I used what connections I had
to push things where they needed to be.

272
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,197
I suppose this benefactor of yours
had you test out your powers

273
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,366
by blowing up all those locations.

274
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,243
You're as sharp as they say.

275
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,996
Your friend at the parlor, he was a bonus.

276
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,382
Nuno.

277
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,759
Hey, little Trese.

278
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,428
Can't have you hurting my familiar.

279
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,180
That sneaky little shit.

280
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,266
Straight up,
I'm just going to kill him.

281
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,436
I know, I know.
Hurts not to see things coming.

282
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,480
We had an understanding, Nuno.

283
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:05,902
Only way a guy like me really thrives
is if nobody talks to each other.

284
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,989
The accords were bad for business.

285
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:13,743
And I was granted the power
to raze this country to the ground

286
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,079
and rebuild it back up again.

287
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,082
A mutually beneficial partnership.

288
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:24,588
The same partnership I once offered
to your father and the Council.

289
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,715
I could have lived with a "no."

290
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,261
All of them just have to laugh.

291
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,974
It's nothing personal, <i>Lakan,</i>
just revenge.

292
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,269
You hurt Hank. You made it personal.

293
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,152
This ammo's not going to last.

294
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,787
See, girls, that's the look
I was talking about.

295
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:53,134
A righteous man has no weakness to show.

296
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,236
Hard to get
a clean shot, <i>bossing</i>.

297
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,854
Can't we just blow them up?

298
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,607
<i>Gago,</i> they will
just put up their shields again.

299
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,529
You're both right.
Come around from behind, boys.

300
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,364
Make sure you distract the Mayor

301
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,908
and make those <i>Laman Lupa</i>
put up those shields.

302
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,786
I'm on Nuno.
And whatever you do, don't stop firing.

303
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,663
What are you going to do?

304
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,581
Call in my last favor.

305
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,094
Give up this useless struggle.

306
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:39,973
Yeah, this guy's practically impenetrable.

307
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,603
That's what I'm counting on.

308
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,166
Close call, <i>bossing.</i>

309
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,543
They're all close ones.

310
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,686
No telling who else the Mayor and Nuno
roped into their scheme.

311
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,314
- We have...
- <i>Bossing</i>, we just won.

312
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,483
Can't we have a drink and call it a day?

313
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,988
Okay, but you two are buying.

314
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,698
We start first thing tomorrow.

315
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,867
I don't think you'll need
to wait any longer.

316
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,126
Nuno and the Mayor
have served their purpose,

317
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,003
as have you all.

318
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,214
I commend you, little Trese.

319
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,883
I didn't think you'd make it this far.

320
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:01,137
It has been amusing watching you struggle,

321
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:05,392
but it is time for you
to face your true destiny.

322
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,831
