1
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,800
Ow!

2
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,431
What do you want? Money?

3
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,432
I got money.

4
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,515
My dad's got money!

5
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,978
That's the problem with you men.

6
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,980
You always think it's about money.

7
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,983
But it's about power.

8
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,404
And the power I'm looking for,
you can't give me.

9
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,489
Wait...

10
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,630
Busy night, Sergeant Guerrero.

11
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,383
You're telling me. Damn bloodbath.

12
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,261
But only the bodyguards
have their hearts cut out.

13
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,974
And it turns out they're all ex-military,
all from the same unit.

14
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,686
The Skeleton Crew.

15
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,897
We recognize the tattoos, boss.

16
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,691
Used to be deployed down south.

17
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,569
Crazy bunch with an even crazier CO.

18
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,782
Heard he was honorably discharged
after an operation went sideways.

19
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,410
See if your contacts in the military
can track him down for us.

20
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,412
We should pay him a visit.

21
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,580
Copy that, boss.

22
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,457
We'll get the info to you once we get it.

23
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,378
You think the bodyguards were the target?

24
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,505
We'll see.

25
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,804
Can I do it, Papa?

26
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,273
<i>Sa mata ng iba, mga lihim magpapakita.</i>

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,660
Our prime suspect.

28
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,248
Does she look familiar?

29
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,209
I can check our files,
but it'll take time.

30
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,961
Bantay, Puti.

31
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,756
Scent's still strong.

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,258
We'll track her down.

33
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,099
I think I need a drink.

34
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,896
Colonel Hidalgo.

35
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,395
Are you all right?

36
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,406
Colonel.

37
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,784
We think that someone
is murdering soldiers from your unit.

38
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,202
They're gone.

39
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,746
If your life is in danger...

40
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,540
My wife and family are gone.

41
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,713
People will say they left me,
but I know the truth.

42
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,757
It was Ramona.

43
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,800
You mean this woman?

44
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,014
The face of the devil herself.

45
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,186
Her band of rebels had been murdering
my men for months

46
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,438
before we tracked her to their camp.

47
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,484
But like all rebels,
they had their superstitions.

48
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,821
Believe they could call
on the powers of war itself.

49
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,865
A blood ritual.

50
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,451
A <i>death</i> ritual.

51
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,329
So you made her into a trophy.

52
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,958
A sick prize for men possessed,

53
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,545
possessed by blood, by lust, by war.

54
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,591
We didn't know what we had done until we...

55
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,054
She was a prisoner.

56
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,431
That doesn't make you soldiers.

57
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,058
That makes you cowards.

58
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,227
You don't understand!

59
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,481
The power of the ritual
had poisoned our minds,

60
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,025
taken control of our will.

61
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,654
By the time we came
to our senses, she'd escaped.

62
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,614
Colonel, your men are dead.

63
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,494
Killed by a woman
who wants retribution for your actions.

64
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,871
If she is coming for you...

65
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,206
Then let her come!

66
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,711
I killed her men and she killed mine.

67
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,089
But death comes for all of us.

68
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,216
Eventually, it will come for you.

69
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,510
The both of you.

70
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,220
Papa?

71
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,724
Don't worry, Alex, we're done here.

72
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,855
Watch his head.

73
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,704
Alexandra, thank you for coming.

74
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,249
I'm happy to oblige, Captain.

75
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,877
But a car crash has little to do
with my field of expertise.

76
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,674
Third drag race this month
to end in a car crash.

77
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,217
And it's also the third time

78
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,554
where the winning car
disappears to thin air.

79
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:16,853
Nothing picked up by checkpoints,
patrol cars, like he just vanished.

80
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,522
I didn't think drag races
were still a thing around here.

81
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,149
I wish they weren't.

82
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,192
And so does my <i>tito.</i>

83
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,737
Alexandra. This is my nephew, Marco.

84
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,323
From the Philippine
Fifth Infantry Division.

85
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,994
He's old friends
with the victim, JP Llorca.

86
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,288
It just doesn't make sense.

87
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,665
JP's been racing cars since he was a kid.

88
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,917
He wouldn't just wipe out like that.

89
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,470
Hoofprints.

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,474
Huh?

91
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,858
Looks like he had a passenger, a girl.

92
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,069
JP went everywhere
with his girlfriend, Coreen.

93
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,989
I've tried calling her,
but it's like she vanished, too.

94
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,284
Witnesses placed the victim
with a girl before the race.

95
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:17,872
Coreen would never leave JP,
especially not before a race.

96
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,749
No trace, no body.

97
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,543
She could have been kidnapped.

98
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,175
Boys, this isn't the time
to be mingling with the locals.

99
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,886
They're not just <i>any</i> locals, <i>bossing</i>.

100
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,387
They're witnesses.

101
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,472
I'm Hannah.

102
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,349
And I'm Amie.

103
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,103
You're wind people.

104
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,480
Yeah.

105
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:46,609
We're big fans of races.
The faster the car, the better.

106
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,530
We are especially fond
of that bright blue racer.

107
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,074
- You saw the other driver?
- Mm-hm.

108
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:57,328
Tall, dark, mysterious type,
full of bestial energy.

109
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,830
Had some real horsepower,
if you catch our drift.

110
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,003
I think I know where to start looking
for our missing girl.

111
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,441
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I think you have the wrong floor.

112
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,569
This is reserved for executives.

113
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,612
We're here to see Señor Armanaz.

114
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,115
- Do you have an appointment?
- It's urgent.

115
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,035
All matters of the Señor are urgent.

116
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,372
So unless you have
an appointment, security will be...

117
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,963
Señor Armanaz will see you now.

118
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,755
Thank you.

119
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,217
Only you, ma'am.

120
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:57,573
Señor Armanaz, Great Stallion,
and Lord of the <i>Tikbalang,</i>

121
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,534
I thank you for granting me an audience.

122
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,330
You are a strong-minded one,
little Trese.

123
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,165
Much like your father.

124
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:11,629
I only hope that the matter you bring
to me today is worthy of my time...

125
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,506
for your sake.

126
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,344
I beg your forgiveness, Señor,
but I have reason to believe

127
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,389
that one of your tribesmen
may have taken a trophy,

128
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,848
a young girl.

129
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,267
I need only to see her return to safety.

130
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,230
If whom you seek
is truly from my tribe,

131
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,774
then I shall take care of it myself.

132
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:39,073
If human trophies are indeed being taken,
then it would only upset the balance

133
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,283
between the human world
and the Underworld.

134
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,788
I have ruled
over these lands for millennia past...

135
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,750
...and you dare lecture me?

136
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,420
I meant no offense, Your Greatness,

137
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,005
but just as you watch over
the good of your tribe,

138
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,133
I too watch over mine.

139
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,970
Your father would be proud to see you

140
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,681
walking in his footsteps,
little Alexandra.

141
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,436
It's unfortunate that I cannot say
the same for my son, Maliksi.

142
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,564
He has gone missing these past weeks.

143
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,609
You shall return him to me, yes?

144
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,362
I promise you, Señor,

145
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,866
when I find the girl,
I shall return your son to safety.

146
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,620
<i>Guerrero called again.</i>

147
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,122
<i>Busy night, bossing.</i>

148
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,624
<i>I feel like
the Underworld is testing me.</i>

149
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,173
Captain Guerrero, we weren't expecting
to see you so soon.

150
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,552
Yeah, we got a call about a repairman
getting struck by lightning

151
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,471
while working on an electric pole.

152
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,308
It's nothing out of the ordinary
until you take a look at this.

153
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,604
Four individual incidents
of electrocution.

154
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,773
All accidents, all in four months.

155
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,067
Right here in the same village.

156
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,154
Sounds like too much of a coincidence.

157
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,993
<i>Tabi-tabi po.</i>

158
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,582
I knew you'd be snooping around here

159
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,458
sooner or later, little Trese.

160
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,044
Nuno, the accidents here in Livewell...

161
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,215
Aren't all a case of cross circuits,
if you ask me.

162
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,467
Been hearing ramblings
about the folks here

163
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,595
being extra prayerful lately.

164
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,389
I don't mean church either.

165
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,517
Trying to keep their happy lives
here and live

166
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,144
while still chug-chug-chugging along.

167
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,854
Then who are they praying to?

168
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:39,902
Let us just say they are still looking
to the heavens for answers.

169
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,240
So you might need a bit of magic
to part the clouds, so to speak.

170
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,327
Don't wander too far, Nuno,
in case I call on you again.

171
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,332
I never do.

172
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,009
<i>Mga dating nakakubli, ngayo'y ibunyag.</i>

173
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,554
Was this on any

174
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,810
of the other victims, Captain?

175
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,146
That wasn't in the coroner's report.

176
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,606
I can ask.

177
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,066
Don't bother.

178
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,986
I've always been meaning to complain
about our electricity bill.

179
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:31,287
Alexandra Trese,
surprised to see you here so late.

180
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:36,625
But then again, your line of work
does tend to keep you up at night.

181
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,211
Not any more than you, Bagyon Lektro.

182
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:43,632
Especially after finding your son's sigil
on a dead body in Livewell Village.

183
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,595
I don't quite like
what you're implying, Ms. Trese.

184
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,264
I know the rules.

185
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:54,852
Our family does not deal
in the trafficking of souls.

186
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,146
Not even if they were sacrificed
in your name?

187
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,608
I know how your family operates,
Bagyon Lektro.

188
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,771
You don't have free rein
over the lives of this city.

189
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,818
Not while I'm here.

190
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:09,074
Don't mistake me
for some lived-old horseman, Alexandra.

191
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,869
That balance
you and your father have tried

192
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,289
so desperately to maintain is at its end.

193
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,893
Is that why
you and your son have returned

194
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,960
to soliciting sacrifices
after all these years?

195
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:28,636
My son, my tribe, my family
is none of your business.

196
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,347
Then stay well away from mine

197
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,934
or the next dead body
with your son's sigil will be his.

198
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,898
You're treading
on very thin ice, little Trese.

199
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,818
Your father would have respected
my authority.

200
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,404
Meanwhile, you're letting
the foal of Armanaz

201
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,865
run wild in the streets of Manila.

202
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,084
- Whoa! Yeah!
- Yeah!

203
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,115
Are you sure
he's gonna be here?

204
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,233
As long as there's a worthy competition...

205
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,318
He'll never miss a race.

206
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,070
Just make sure you don't forget our deal.

207
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,030
Don't worry about us.

208
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,573
Just keep your eye on the road.

209
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,952
And make sure to have our prize
at the finish line.

210
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,961
Eh, you up for a race?

211
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,213
It depends.

212
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,798
You up for a challenge?

213
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,842
Haven't turned one down yet.

214
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,052
Winner gets a trophy.

215
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,931
Haven't heard that in a while.

216
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,808
You'll have to win first.

217
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,439
Ready, set...

218
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,257
Anytime you're ready, girls.

219
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,260
Then you better hold on to your hairdo.

220
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,638
'Cause once we go,
there's no turning back.

221
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,972
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

222
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,224
Now!

223
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:29,983
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

224
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,616
You cheated!

225
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,410
You use magic, I use magic.

226
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,037
Sounds like a fair race to me.

227
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,499
I do not lose to inferior humans!

228
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,961
But you still lost,
which means you still owe me a trophy.

229
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,632
I am Maliksi, prince of the <i>Tikbalang.</i>

230
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,552
I owe you nothing.

231
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,638
And I was mistaken to think
that a prince of the <i>Tikbalang</i>

232
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,515
would still honor the code of the race.

233
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,767
Your father would be disappointed.

234
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,231
If only for the code of my people.

235
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,733
You may take your trophy.

236
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,444
She's nothing but a trinket to me.

237
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,537
<i>Boys, Lektro called.</i>

238
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,497
<i>He says he wants to make a deal.</i>

239
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,167
<i>We'll pay him a visit
after we drop off Coreen.</i>

240
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,465
You don't remember a thing, do you?

241
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,050
Nothing.

242
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,180
Not after JP agreed to race that blue car.

243
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,349
And then, well, that's when you showed up.

244
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,644
I don't know. It's like...

245
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,938
Someone cast a spell on you?

246
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,941
Something like that, yeah.

247
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,112
Is my boyfriend going to be okay?

248
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,949
The hospital says
he'll recover soon enough.

249
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,243
You can visit him after we take you home.

250
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,510
Find out anything good, <i>bossing</i>?

251
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,222
Yeah, we've been itching
for some action back here.

252
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,307
Bagyon Lektro wasn't there.

253
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,018
If he thinks I'm playing his game,
he's got another thing coming.

254
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,065
Looks like he's already
making his move, <i>bossing</i>.

255
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,865
Oh, not the car.

256
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,023
Alexandra Trese,
you dare challenge my father, my family?

257
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,317
Bagyon Kulimlim.

258
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,444
Still the spoiled brat
you've always been, I see.

259
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,908
The only thing spoiled
will be your burned carcass, Trese.

260
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,338
It's over, Alexandra.

261
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,717
Your father isn't here to protect you.

262
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,522
How are you, little Trese?

263
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,525
Sorry, I'm late. Traffic and all that.

264
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,819
Better late than never, Nuno.

265
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,457
Ground him!

266
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,394
Thanks for the assist, Nuno.

267
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,146
You know me.

268
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,524
I never miss a chance
to stick it to them big boys.

269
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,902
But you got to be careful who you trip up.

270
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,572
Can't be too sure
about the Underworld these days.

271
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,243
Anyone got spare change?

272
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,579
'Cause it looks like
we're taking the train.

273
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,422
Coffee, <i>bossing</i>?

274
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,175
Thanks, Hank.

275
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,181
Good morning, girls.
Did you enjoy your prize?

276
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,642
Um...

277
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,103
- Yeah.
- I guess you could say that.

278
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:20,232
Wait a minute, we were the prize
for winning the race?

279
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,025
I feel objectified.

280
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,612
Speaking of prizes,
that Marco guy sends his regards.

281
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,366
Wanted to thank you for getting
his friend's girlfriend back.

282
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,452
Even asked for your number
to thank you personally.

283
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,372
Oh, sounds like
he has a crush on you, <i>bossing</i>.

284
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,970
I told you to stay out
of my affairs, Alexandra.

285
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,139
Good morning, Bagyon Lektro.

286
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,849
You could have used the front door.

287
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,185
You extended the courtesy
to the <i>Tikbalang,</i>

288
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,771
but not to me, not to my son?

289
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,273
Courtesy went out the door

290
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,567
when Bagyon Kulimlim
attacked me in the open.

291
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,697
Then you will pay
for your transgressions, Alexandra Trese.

292
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,158
There is a storm coming.

293
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:15,745
And when it does,
don't expect help from my tribe.

294
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,502
Not counting on it, Lektro.

295
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,879
Whatever the storm,

296
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,006
we'll be ready.
