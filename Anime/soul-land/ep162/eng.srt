The Hanhai Soul Arena really is different.

57
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,690
I wonder how much
the ocean soul masters' fighting styles

58
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,890
differ from ours.

59
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,460

60
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,930
You brought us here
to fight against ocean soul masters.

61
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,060
But why are only Fatty and Xiang competing?

62
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,430
Fatty keeps showing off.

63
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,990
If we all compete together,

64
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,690
it might attract attention
from the Martial Soul Hall.

65
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,390
Fatty and Xiang are participating

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,660
in the level 50 competition.

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,260
Within the same level,

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,190
Fatty is definitely one of the best.

69
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,760
More importantly,

70
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,130
they can both fly

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,690
and won't be at a disadvantage
because of the water stage.

72
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,360

73
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,190

81
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,390
Be careful of what you say,

82
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,230
especially in front of Xiang.

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,730

martial soul fusion skills.

The water hurricane is only half as big.

186

He still couldn't break
their martial soul fusion skill.

187
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,830
Fatty might actually lose.

188
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,760
But that's strange.

189
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,060
Why do the Haipo Brothers

190
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,190
look like they still haven't recovered?

191
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,130
How are you feeling?

192
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,760
Don't be too obsessed with me.

193
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,490
I am but a legend.

194
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,530
Break!

195
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,830
You broke the Water Hurricane!

196
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,590
I even gave everyone a free hot shower.

197
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
The Haipo Brothers

198
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:19,970
actually...

199
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,660
actually lost?

200
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,890
They were clearly at an advantage!

201
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,160
How did they win?

202
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,560
I don't know either.

203
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,530
But I know for sure

204
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,860
that it wasn't because of luck.

205
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,330
Let's go down and see.

206
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,060
Host?

207
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,290
Where is the host?

208
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,830
Announce the result.

209
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,830
They're already unconscious.

210
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,560
We won.

211
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,990
Right, that's right!

212
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,190
The match is over.

213
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,530
Team Feng Xiang wins!

214
00:13:52,730 --> 00:14:03,090
Team Feng Xiang!

215
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,290
Wait.

216
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,090
I'm the only one that can heal their wounds.

217
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,790
So sorry, both of you.

218
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,290
I merely had a good strategy.

219
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,160
We deserved to lose.

220
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,090
Are those your friends?

221
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,360
I'm not as competent as you are. See you.

222
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,360
Good job, Fatty.

223
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,730
You even won this match.

224
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,790
Thanks to Xiang's help at the right time.

225
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,660
I think you both worked together well.

226
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,060
Rong Rong, you...!

227
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,590
Hey, Fatty.

228
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,890
Tell me.

229
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,160
How did you win today?

230
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,690
Actually,

231
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,130
when I first flew through their water screen,

232
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,760
I set off two beams of fire energy

233
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,790
using my right soul bone

234
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,090
under the cover of the water screen
and the Flying Phoenix.

235
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,130
No wonder the Haipo Brothers looked so red

236
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,130
and didn't recover.

237
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,330
The fire energy entered their bodies

238
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,790
and hurt their blood vessels and nerves.

239
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,260
When they used their martial soul fusion skill,

240
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,790
this gust of energy exploded as well.

241
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,090
I truly couldn't withstand
their fusion skill in the end,

242
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,530
but

243
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,060
they also couldn't keep using
their fusion skill.

244
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,630
That's how I won.

245
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,160
I saw you attacking head-on

246
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,460
and even said you were stupid.

247
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,360
But I misunderstood.

248
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,430
Not really.

249
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,060
I only did so to look more handsome.

250
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,130
Setting off the energy beams

251
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,190
was just on the way.

252
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,830
Then from now on,

253
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,330
you can be on the way more.

254
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,630
During today's match,
if Xiang and I couldn't fly,

255
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,290
we definitely would've lost.

256
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,460
If we meet ocean soul beasts out at sea,

257
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,130
what should those of us
who don't know how to fly

258
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,430
do instead?

259
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,730
It looks like

260
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,560
we need to go to the auction site.

261
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,590
Brother Dai.

262
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,030
You take Fatty back to rest.

263
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:38,960
Rong Rong,

264
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,410
Ao.

265
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,890
Why don't we go

266
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,090
and take a look at the auction?

267
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,190
Welcome to Deep Sea Auction!

268
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,990
Any higher bidding price?

269

Deal.
