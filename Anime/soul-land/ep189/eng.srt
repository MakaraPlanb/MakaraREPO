If it weren't for Grand Seahorse Master,

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,330
countless lives would have been lost.

35
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,830
So you forced me to use the Ninth Skill

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,430
in order to drain my soul power

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,130
so that Oscar can have
more advantages in his test.

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,430
The news that we lost Gengxin Town
will quickly spread across the continent.

39
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,660
Pain is an excellent teacher.

40

Third Skill, Shadow of the Lance!

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,660
(That's fast!)

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,260
Good, you are strong enough to take my tests.

Jiubao Boosts!
First, Strength! Second, Speed! Third, Soul!

48
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,390
Good.

49
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
This skill...

50
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,460
His true form is combined with a tool soul.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,290
The man and the sword are becoming one.

52
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,060
(He can combine himself with his tool soul
just like the Grand Sword Master.)

53
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,390
(One can never overestimate it.
Watch out, Boss Dai!)

54
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,330
Fourth Skill,

55
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,360
White Tiger Meteor Strike!

56
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,490
(That's weird.)

(It's like I am attacking
some invulnerable metals.)

58
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,460
(Doing no damage but only defending.)

59
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,030
(Something is off.)

60
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,230
(Boss Dai, switch to defense!)

61
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,030

Martial Soul Form!

64
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,730
This is his Eighth Skill.

65
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,930
His lance can block your attacks
with the Martial Soul Form,

66
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,860
or even absorb your attacks
before deflecting back.

67
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,290
Can you hold it, Boss Dai?

68
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,130
No problem.

69
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,130
We are lucky that we chose to back off
instead of comforting them.

70
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,690
Judging from your defenses and attacks,
you guys seem to know my skills well.

71
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,360
You're half right,
we do have a mastermind behind us.

72
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,630
But we are more than that.

73
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,460
Ridiculous.

74
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,190
Guidance from a mastermind won't make up
the gap of soul power between us.

75
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,930
You are about to witness my true strength.

76
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,460
Wait, why is the lance shooting itself?

77
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,360
Hold your fire, this is unknown.

78
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,360
This is... Intrinsic Domain!

79
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,190
I didn't think he could have a domain too.

80
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,530
Boss Dai, he is absorbing energy from the ocean!

81
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,430
Attack now!

82
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,590
Second Skill, White Tiger Intense Light Wave!

83
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,860
Six, Advance!

84
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,930
Looks like

85
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,730

are having more advantages now.

86

This massive attack, Boss Dai...

108
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,530
The Grand Sea Lance Master's
Ninth Skill is a solo attack.

109
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,090
Once you are locked, you won't be able to dodge it.

110
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,160
How come...

111
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,690
You fellow has been severely damaged by me

112
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,490
and so have I by him.

113
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,090
I admit that this has been a draw fight.

114
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:30,760
Wait a second.

115
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,290
What!

116
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,930
My apologies.

117
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,390
It was my clone attacking you
on the Sacred Totem Platform.

118
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,230
(I immediately detached from it
and jumped into the ocean.)

119
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,590
You...

120
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,630
Dai Mu Bai did it in good timing, nice.

121
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,960
I was so worried about him.

and copied your Ghost Shadow Doppelganger.

123

Your attacks were strong, indeed.

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,360
The only one on Haishen Island that can take it

125
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,430
is probably the Grand Ocean Master, Bo Sai Xi.

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,390
It's you.

Devil White Shark,

129
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,660
you are their mastermind?

130
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,460
Don't you know you are not allowed to guide them
during the God of the Ocean tests?

131
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,030
It's not her.

132
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,230
She only provided guidance before the tests.

133
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,690
It was me who predicted every move of yours.

134
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,290
How?

135
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,790
You will understand later.

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,430
That is to say,
it was you two fighting me on the surface,

137
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,030
but actually there were others?

138
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,830
In your final attack,

139
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,060
why did the Tiger Wiping Kill suddenly change

140
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,760
from attacking the front to the side?

141
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,830
Who was behind that?

142
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,660
Senior, there was no one else.

143
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,830
It was my Space of Illusion, it fools people.

144
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,590
The pressure of my final attack

145
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,190
switched direction under the effects
of Space of Illusion.

146
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,030
(Therefore, the pressure of my attacks
was separated from my actual offense.)

147
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,630
(I see.)

148
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,890

from the battles with other Grand Ocean Masters.

150
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,430

This feels familiar.

182
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,560
It's the Light of the God of the Ocean.
He can finally control it!

183
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,660
Fifth Skill, Blue Silver Emperor Tyrant Spear!

184
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,930
Senior, about what you asked me before,

185
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,160
I think you must have the answer now.

186
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,830
I have a skull with spirit power.

187
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,360
The light you are seeing right now is more than
the Light of the God of the Ocean.

188
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,330
It is also the spirit power, visualized by
the Light of the God of the Ocean.

189
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
I used this spirit power

190
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,930
to predict every move of yours in our fight.

191
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,290
The Light of the God of the Ocean. No wonder I lost.

192
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,660
(Tang San, you have passed
the Grand Sea Lance Sacred Totem Test.)

193
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,230
If the God of the Ocean has approved you,

194
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,630
then I have nothing to say, just leave.

195
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,590
It seems

196
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,430
that only Grand Sea Delusion Master,
the man who craves battle,

197
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,690
can defeat you.

198
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,790
Angel's Wing Skill which is provided by
Angel's Right Arm Soul Bone

199
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,760
not only has strong defensive pow
but can also deflect the damage.

200
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,290
But it also costs a massive amount of soul power.

201
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,560
Xue, I don't think you have much soul power left.

202
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,360
You still want to go on?

203
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,830
(Will I still lose this time?)

204
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,660
(I was careless. I can't move now.)

205
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,690
(No, if I stop here, I will never be able to defeat him.)

206
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,080
(Since I have come this far,)

207
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,590
(I will never give up!)

he would die in reality too.
