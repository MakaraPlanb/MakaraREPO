If we can't communicate with Xing Luo Empire,

64
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,050

Although the three board members

come from Martial Soul Empire,

81
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:30,283
they've chosen to stay in Tian Dou.

To prevent future problems,

83
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:33,850

that even the Grand Sea Dragon Master
won't easily challenge him.

00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:41,850
This Soft Bone Rabbit

191
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:44,550
chose a more dominant way.

192
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:46,383
Is Sister Wu

193
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:49,917
really worth it?

194
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,083
Goodbye,

195
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,783
my love.

196
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,983
No!

197
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,383
Enough!

198
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:11,817
(Wu,)

199
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,783
(I said that I would use my life to protect you.)

200
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,783
Everyone, look!

201
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,717
(My domain was clearly in full control
of their emotions.)

202
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,650
(But Tang San broke through)

203
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,850
(and even managed to make a strong
spiritual attack on me.)

204
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,950
I rarely see San so discomposed.

205
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:09,350
What exactly did they

206
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,417
experience in there?

207
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:12,917
Illusion type skills,

208
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,017
such as Rong Rong's Space of Illusion,

209
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:16,550
are best

210
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,883
at confusing the enemy's spirit.

211
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:20,383
(But based on San's injuries,)

212
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,283
(the Grand Sea Delusion Master's Innate Domain)

213
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,317
(is clearly different from normal illusions.)

214
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,717
(It's as if he's created a real world.)

215
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:29,883
(Once the enemy is lost within it)

216
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:31,783
(and sustains life-threatening injuries,)

217
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:34,517
they will likely die in real life as well.

218
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,183
You shouldn't have used that scene
to infuriate me

219
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:45,817
and hurt Wu.

220
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,050
Finding my enemy's most painful memory

221
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,317
and enhancing the pain

222
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:51,850
is my domain's specialty.

223
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:53,883
You should

224
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:56,017
blame yourself for not being powerful enough

225
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:57,483
to protect your loved one.

226
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,550
You...!

227
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:06,117
Brother,

228
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,117
don't be rash.

229
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:08,617
I'm alright now.

230
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:10,817
Wu.

231
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:12,683
I won't let go of anyone

232
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,117
who has hurt you.

233
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:19,117
Did I stab at where it hurt most?

234
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,783
So what if you tried your best
to kill the enemies in the illusion?

235
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,817
It only proved the incapacity
you once had in the past.
