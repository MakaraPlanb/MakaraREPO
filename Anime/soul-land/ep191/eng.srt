But every time I see you get hurt,

69
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,830
it brings me back to
that most painful moment.

70
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,590
I will never leave you again.

71
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,730

to not lose control like this anymore.

Okay?

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,830
Now that I think about it,

74
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,860
after the Grand Sea Delusion Master
was spiritually attacked once,

75
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,830
he didn't stall for time for his spirit
to recover and activate his domain again.

76
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,690
Instead, he kept taunting me
so that I would explode.

77
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,830
If you need to blame someone,

78
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,960
blame yourself for not
being able to protect your loved one.

79
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,530
Senior is provoking me on purpose.

80
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,260
Under extreme emotions, you will exhibit
unimaginable power.

81
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,190
But you will also lose self-control.

83
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,890
Your power is indisputable,

84
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,360
but your temperament
still needs maturing.

92

In order to truly win
the Angel's approval,

101
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,290
you need to become stronger.

102
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,560
The strong need to be extremely talented,

103
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,230
but more importantly, you need to have
a calm and strong heart.

104

how will you face failure

107
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,490
I'm asking you in the name of the angel guardian.

108
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,360
Can you really undertake the future of the angels?

109
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,390

so I only focused on becoming stronger.

111

But this persistence

112
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,490
made me impatient
and made it hard to achieve my goals.

113

What the angel gods need is 
a pure conviction without doubts.

is no weaker than the Grand Sea Lance Master.

Even though he is
slightly worse at combat,

119
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,630
his ability to control the mind and soul
is quite terrifying.

120
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,030

121

157
