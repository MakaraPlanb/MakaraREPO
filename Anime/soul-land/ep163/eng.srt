[Previous episode]

32
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,900
The first match will be between Team Feng Xiang

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,930
and the Haipo Brothers!

34
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,460
Who knew the cost of acting cool
would be this high?

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,330
What is Xiang doing?

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
She's covering for me

37
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,500
so that I can regain strength.

38
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,230
Martial Soul Fusion Skill!

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,730
Am I that unlucky?

Fatty!

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,630
Stop holding out!

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,660
Let's admit defeat.

43
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,260
Break!

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,800
If Xiang and I both didn't know how to fly,

45
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,500
we definitely would've lost.

46
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,400
It looks like we need to go to the auction site.

47
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,220
[Episode 163]

48
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,500
This next auction item

49
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,900
is

50
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,260
a treasure

51
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,730
that every navigator desires.

52
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,200
Don't soul guiding tools have set shapes?

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,200
They can change?

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,030
Yes.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,160
Although the art of creating and making

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,560
soul guiding tools was lost long ago,

57
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,160
I heard

58
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,900
that transformative soul guiding tools exist

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,230
and are easier to carry.

60
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,060
The Dragon Boat

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,060
is an ancient treasure.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,960
It can withstand soul skill attacks
from Century Soul Beasts.

63
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,360
Its body is transparent

64
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,960
and you can observe the ocean
from every angle within.

65
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,630
It can sail

66
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,830
and also act as a submarine,

67
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,130
traveling back and forth freely

68
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,900
and not afraid of anything.

69
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,030
I heard that the power of an ocean soul beast

70
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,700
is a few times scarier than a land soul beast

71
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,860
of the same level.

72
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,860
If the Vast Sea and Universe Shield

73
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,660
can still keep us hidden in the water,

74
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,400
then along with the Dragon Boat...

75
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,500
Yes.

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,330
Ocean soul masters are very good
at using their advantage.

77
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,060
With water as a medium,

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,800
they can save a lot of soul power.

79
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,430
Fatty is right.

80
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,630
The power of water

81
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,130
can increase an ocean soul master's power

82
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,430
multiple times.

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,830
When we set sail,

84
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,100
we need to be extra careful.

85
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,530
Did we get anything from the auction?

86
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,130
But...

87
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,430
We still need to test it.

88
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,360
Let's leave tomorrow.

89
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,760

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,900
We'll need to trouble you.

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,930
Over our ten-day trip,

92
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,260
we need you to keep watch in the air
for at least six hours a day.

93
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,780
Okay.

94
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,100

In case of battle,

97
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,700
the three of us will be a group.

98
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,200
I will use Blue Silver Emperor
to aid your attacks.

99
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,360
Alright.

100
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,130
Fatty.

101
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,830
Phoenix Flame can effectively
control ocean water.

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,530
When battling, try conserving your soul power

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,360
to make a more powerful attack.

104
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,230

106
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,060

Ao.

108
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,930
Have Flight Mushroom Sausages
prepared at all times.

109
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,160
No problem.

110
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,160
Also,

111
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,360
we're not used to the water,

112
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,660
so we need to rent a boat

113
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,300
to get familiar with it.

114
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,300
Fresh fish!

115
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,260
Here, come over and take a look!

116
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,530
I heard that this is where trade both starts

117
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,930
and ends by the water.

118
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,660
This is very delicious.

119
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,500
It really wasn't just a rumor.

120
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,730
The alkali flats next to the water
aren't fit for farming,

121
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,630
so the pier is Hanhai City's
biggest place for profit.

122
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Although the ocean is filled
with dangerous soul beasts,

123
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
it's also full of unlimited riches.

124
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,960
What about that one?

125
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a good size

126
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,360
and covered by iron shields.

127
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,230
Its defenses look strong.

128
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,930
Let's go and take a look.

129

Besides me,

141
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,900

143
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
We're ready.

144
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Pull up the anchor.

145
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,680
Release the sails.

146
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,600

Wu, stop eating snacks.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Haishen Island,

150
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,230
we're coming.

151
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Don't worry.

152
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,560
You'll get used to it after throwing up
a few more times.

153
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,850
Based on the location of the sun,

154
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,760
we're sailing in the right direction.

155
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,030
We're getting closer to Haishen Island.

156
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,060
Mr. Soul Master,

157
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,330
we have another eight days

158
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,930
before reaching the destination.

159
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:16,930
Captain.

160
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,100
If we meet powerful soul beasts,

161
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,160
what will you do?

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,760
The boat is covered in special medicine.

163
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
The soul beasts strongly dislike this scent.

164
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,260
They usually won't come close.

165
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,400
But if we really run into them,

166
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,130
then we can only consider ourselves unlucky.

167
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,330
After all,

168
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,930
no matter how tough the boat is,

169
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,430
it can't withstand those scary monsters.

170
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,960
But...

171
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,560
you can rest assured.

172
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,100
Captains who are brave enough to sail far

173
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,200
all have a map in their minds.

174
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,700
Based on this map,

175
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,660
we can usually guarantee the safety
of our passengers.

176
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,430
What map?

177
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,160
A map of where the powerful soul beasts
are located.

178
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,230
Ocean soul beasts are similar to the land ones.

179
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,260
They each have their own territories.

180
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:07,960
So

181
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,400
we just need to avoid these territories

182
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,360
in order to not alert them

183
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,600
and cause trouble.

184
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,400
It seems like

185
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,660
you're very familiar

186
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,660
with soul beasts.

187
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,400
We live on the ocean.

188
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,900
Of course we need to know a bit more.

189
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,230
Am I right?

190
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:10,690
[Soul Land]

191
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,330
Brother.

192
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,600
Let's go out and take a look.

193
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:36,900
Brother.

194
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,660
Come over here.

195
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,260
I'll just stay here and look at you.

196
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,760
Brother.

197
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,660
Do you know?

198
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,030
During the fives years that we were separated,

199
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
I would always look at the stars

200
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,730
whenever I missed you.

201
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,100
I really hoped that you would be by my side.

202
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:58,730
Stupid girl.

203
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,960
My wish is also to always be

204
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,330
by your side.

205
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,600
Brother.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,560
Actually,

207
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,430
as long as my soul

208
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,230
can meet you once every day,

209
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm already

210
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,100
satisfied.

211
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,130
But I'm not.

212
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,930
I want a complete Wu.

213
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,300
But the soul skills you worked so hard
to get will all be wasted.

214
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,500
Your soul power will also never exceed level 90.

215
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,730
I don't want you

216
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,130
to give up so much because of me.

217
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,900
I don't want all these things.

218
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,700
I just want to be with you forever.

219
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,660
Stupid girl.

220
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,160
Why can you sacrifice yourself for me,

221
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,930
but I can't make sacrifices for you?

222
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,100
I'm willing

223
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,530
to give my all to you.

224
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,560
Mr. Soul Master.

225
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,860
Today's breakfast includes black bread,

226
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,530
fish soup,

227
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,700
smoked salmon,

228
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,660
and caviar.

229
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,360
Please enjoy.

230
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,130
I'm full already.

231
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,100
I'm going to exercise on the deck.

232
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,260
Ao, Ao!

233
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,600
My distinguished guests.

234
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,630
Did you enjoy your breakfast?

235
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,830
It was great!

236
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,330
Especially the caviar.

237
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,860
Each roe was full

238
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,130
and tasty.

239
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,130
If you sell caviar on land,

240
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,100
it'll be worth even more than gold.

241
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,460
But

242
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,660
an even better feeling

243
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,760
is about to become.

244
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,430
Why... do I feel a bit dizzy?

245
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,100
Who cares if you're soul masters?

246
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,760
Out in the ocean,

247
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,700
this is our world.

248
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,430
Do it.

249
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,100
Tie them up first,

250
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,360
remove their limbs,

251
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,800
and get their soul guiding tools.

252
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,800
Why is there one still awake?

253
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,230
Because she doesn't know
how to pretend like us.

254
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,360
This is impossible.

255
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,500
My Rooster Crowing to Five Drums Potion

256
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,700
is enough to keep someone unconscious
for three days and nights.

257
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,930
You...

258
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
Poison like that

259
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,860
can be detoxified with a
Detoxifying Small Sausage.

260
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,360
When we first set sail,

261
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,100
I noticed that the crewmates

262
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,760
were all more agile

263
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,730
and stronger than normal people.

264
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,160
You were hiding your soul power

265
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,960
and wanted to kill and steal from us.

266
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,700
You must be pirates.

267
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,130
Who cares if you saw through us?

268
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,500
We're on the ocean.

269
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,800
You people from land will all die!

270
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,330
You really don't know who you're up against.

271
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,000
First Skill, Intertwine.

272
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,530
How could a Blue Silver Plant

273
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,400
be so...

274
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,200
The Century Millennium Soul Rings?

275
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,100
We can't just wait for death.

276
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,430
Wait!

277
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,830
Capsize the boat.

278
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,130
They don't know how to swim!

279
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
Even if they're soul emperors,

280
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,830
they'll die when they fall into the ocean!

281
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,330
Third Skill, Flipping Sea Snake!

282
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,600
No!
