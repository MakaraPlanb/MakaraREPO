00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,332
You have so much fighting experience.

71
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,132
I was surprised
that you suppressed water with fire.

72
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:57,965
That's certain.

but Grandpa was always worried

82
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,099
and kept me home.

83

Now you are one of us.

84
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:29,999

90
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,032
Is it a good idea to let Haider take the wheel?

00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,432
We aren't familiar with sailing on the sea.

92
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,932
Having him take us to Haishen Island
is the only way.

I'm here.

103
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:44,999
So many accidents have happened

104
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,598

105
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,965
San said he'd take the shift for tonight.

106
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,365
But we must stay alert.

107
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:56,299
San has his reason to keep Haider

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,332
yet we can't let down our guard

109
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,199

122
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:25,765
Deep down this sea area
is a submarine trench of a thousand meter deep.

In the trench

124
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,332

Although Magic Whales dominate the sea,

130
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,865
they were born lazy

136
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,132
It's too late.

137
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:13,265

The bomb just cast into the sea

140

has already irritated the Magic Whale.

141
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:10,465
It's said

142

that this thing is too powerful

143
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,632
