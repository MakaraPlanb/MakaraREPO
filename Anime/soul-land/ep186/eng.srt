has dared to invade the island.

188
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,560
I don't even have confidence

189
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,730
in challenging one Grand Sacred Totem Master
with my Mirror Copy Sausage.

190
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,660
But San has to challenge all seven
within 72 hours.

191
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,430
Maybe we can tweak the order that we challenge in.

192
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,830
Amongst the Grand Sacred Totem Masters,

193
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,560
we are only familiar
with the Grand Seahorse Master.

194
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,860
(Let's start with him.)

195
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,990
But even with this,

196
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,360
Brother San still has to defeat
all seven on his own.

197
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,690
I have a way

198
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,460
to increase our success rate.

199
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,190
But our rewards might be lessened.

200
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,060
Do you want to try?

201
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,530
Once I challenge and defeat
each of your Grand Masters,

202
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,630
you will challenge them after.

203
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,460
You will very likely pass.

204
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,530
Brother San.

205
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,130
Can't we also do the opposite?

206
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,460
We will challenge our own Grand Masters first

207
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,030
and you go after.

208
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,560
That way, it will be easier for you.

209
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,860
After all,

210
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,590
you have to challenge seven Grand Soul Masters.

211
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,360
But if I successfully pass,

212
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,590
I won't be able to help you all after.

213
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:50,960
San.

214
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,260
We relied on you for the Fourth Test.

215
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,790
For this test,

216
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,530
let us help you.

217
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,330
It will be hard for Ao to pass,

218
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,330
so he will need your help.

219
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,330
But

220
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,390
Zhu Qing, Fatty, and I

221
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,890
can pass on our own.

222
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,130
Especially Zhu Qing.

223
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,930
This is her last test.

224
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,530
Okay.

225
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,230
Take a few days to rest.

226
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,630
We will start training after.

227
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,390
Okay!

228
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,490
As the examiner for the Fifth Test,

229
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,190
you must not hold back.

230
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,530
Don't worry.

231
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,530
The fact that they've gotten this far

232
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,330
shows that they are truly talented.

233
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,330
If we hold back,

234
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,530
things might get difficult too.

235
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,030
Even if it's someone
chosen by the God of the Ocean,

236
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,060
as long as I open his heart,

237
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,060
he will taste extreme pain.
