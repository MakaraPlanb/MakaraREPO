We can't be rash.

145

Water from the Ice Fire Mouth Spring

164

this Double-Layered Jade Bottle

is scary beyond imagination.

As long as the timing is right,

171
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,890
it can burn through the thick skin
of the Demon Tiger Whales.

172
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,060
And then

173
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,030

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,790
The Demon Tiger Whale King
is crueler than I imagined.

176
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
It can even kill its clan without hesitation.

177
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,660
All of his insides are burnt to a crisp.

178
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,160
The crossbows are broken too.

179
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,660
This way, we won't leave any trace.

180
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,330
Demon Tiger Whales excel at searching.

181
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,890
But if they know the enemy is here
and can't trace them,

182
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,590
their spirit will be broken
more than ever before.

183
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,330
Find them.

184
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,190

who is causing trouble in my territory!

186
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,360
Your teleportation

187
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,360
is like being able to suddenly appear
within a given range.

188
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,490
Based on our test just now,

189
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,730
it creates almost no movement.

190
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,860
Besides,

191
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
the Demon Tiger Whales

192
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,760
are all distracted by the crossbows.

193
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,960
(I wonder how San is doing.)

194
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,290
Something's happening!

195
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,160
Everyone moves back 5 kilometers!

196
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,060
(The Devil White Sharks are so scared.)

197
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,760
(Is it the Demon Tiger Whale?)

198
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,890
(Will Brother San and Bai be hurt?)

199
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,660
Useless!

200
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,390
You can't even find the enemy!

201
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,060
(Tang San won't act rashly,)

202
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,130
(but will wait for when they get slack)

203
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:14,990
(and kill at once.)

204
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,390
(The fear of an unknown enemy)

205
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,560
(is spreading amongst the Demon Tiger Whales.)

206
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,160
(This is Tang San's goal.)

207
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,160
(More and more clansmen are dying.)

208
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,560
(We will fall into a passive position
if we stay here.)

209
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,160
They're running away.

210
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,790
If we chase after them,

211
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,790
we'll expose ourselves.

212
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,490
More than 70 whales are dead.

213
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,530
In order to stop his loss,
the Demon Tiger Whale King

214
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,030
will definitely command his clan
to escape in all directions.

215
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,060
We can't catch them all.

216
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,290
Let's stop killing in secret

217
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,330
and start our final attack.

Go die, Demon Tiger!
