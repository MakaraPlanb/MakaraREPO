are the most powerful

185
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,260
but the lowest in number.

186
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,130
Next is the Demon Tiger Whale.

187
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,890
Demon Tiger Whales love to kill.

188
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,760
The group led by the Demon Tiger Whale King

189
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,930
enslave other soul beasts
to kill without reason.

190
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,890
They even look down on the God of the Ocean's rules.

191
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,160
Grown Demon Tiger Whales are about
20 meters in length

192
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,260
and have very strong physiques and skills.

193
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,890
Each group has about 300 whales.

194
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,230
Demon Tiger Whales are our sworn enemy.

195
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,190
Every decade or so, the two kinds
will engage in a battle.

196
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,890
One Demon Tiger Whale

197
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,930
can face off against two of our grown-up kind.

198
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,130
We have always been at a disadvantage.

199
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:25,130
My brother was killed
by the Demon Tiger Whale King.

200
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,190
I hope that we will all return alive.
