Please forgive me

192
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,560
for arriving unannounced.

193

it can still overpower all poisons.

selected by the God of the Ocean.

I hope that in the future,

224
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,160
you will use the same resolve

225
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,030
to protect Haishen Island.

226
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,230
