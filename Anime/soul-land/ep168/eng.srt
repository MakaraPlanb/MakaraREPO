Boss.

35
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,780
You are going to Haishen Island?

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,780
We should get going.

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,880
I will send you off.

38
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,710
You have to come back alive!

39
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,150
There are decade millennium
ocean soul beasts up ahead!

40
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,780
The Vast Sea and Universe Shield
can also protect us against water!

41
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,180

[Episode 168]

43
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,580
That...

44
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,010
That is...

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,010
Devil White Shark.

46
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,680
I thought it saw us.

47
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,310
The Vast Sea and Universe Shield

48
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,480
even hides our breathing.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,880
It seems as if the Shield

50
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,050
is absorbing the ocean's energy.

51
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,750
What's even more magical

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,280
is that it's not my soul bone,

53
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,450
but the energy it absorbs
is flowing inside me.

54
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,880
What on earth is...

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,550
Look!

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,510
Haishen Island!

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,250
We're finally here!

58
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,080
The sky and ocean blend together,

59
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,850
and birds fly around in flocks...

Wu.

61
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,580
It is truly beautiful here.

62
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,580
After we're done with our mission,

63
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,580
let's bring my parents
and spend the rest of our days here,

64
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,380
alright?

65
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,110
Okay.

66
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,710
Someone's there.

67
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,080
Who dares to trespass on the Island?

68
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,080
We have heard much about Haishen Island,

69
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,510
and want to join you.

70
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,610
You are land soul masters, right?

71
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,880
He can tell?

72
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,550
Based on what Ji Xiang said,

73
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,510
the soul masters on Haishen Island,

74
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,450
from the lowest level to the highest,
are wearing white,

75
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,050
yellow, purple, black, and red clothes.

76
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,280
Rankings are determined
by the difficulty of the God of Ocean's test.

77
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,110
But it seems that even
the low-ranked soul masters in yellow

78
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,010
are still quite powerful.

79
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,010
Haishen Island does not welcome you.

80
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,310
Hurry and leave,

81
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,380
or else

82
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,850
don't blame us for being rude.

83
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,880
People can join Haishen Island
by taking the challenge, right?

84
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,150
Why don't you give us any chance at all, senior?

85
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,650
You won't be able to pass the challenge

86
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,180
that the God of the Ocean has
for land soul masters.

87
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,780
Young folks, if you keep acting rashly,

88
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,250
you'll lose your life soon.

89
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,650
You're right.

90
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,650
But if we lose our courage,

91
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,850
we no longer deserve to be soul masters.

92
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,810
Once you accept the challenge,

93
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,250
you can't quit halfway,

94
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,350
even if you die.

95
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,350
Are you absolutely sure?

96
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,650
We want to accept the challenge!

97
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,750
I hope you don't regret this.

98
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,310
Come with me.

99
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,480
Who knew that even on Haishen Island,

100
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,480
Blue Silver Plant still grows everywhere.

101
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,180
Blue Silver Domain.

102
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,510
There is a mystical force
protecting this forest,

103
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,810
stopping me from investigating.

104
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,580
Young folks.

105
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,180
This is Haishen Island.

106
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,610
Everything here is protected

107
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,910
by the God of the Ocean.

108
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,510
Even a yellow soul master

109
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,280
can detect my spirit power.

110
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,050
Then what kind of power
do the purple

111
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,110
and black soul masters,

112
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,080
along with Head Flamen, Bo Sai Xi,

113
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,610
actually have?

114
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,610
Welcome to the Sea Within a Sea.

115
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,150
The pool looks exactly like the sea!

116
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,710
The Seahorse Totem

117
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,950
is one of Haishen Island's Seven Sacred Totems.

118
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,310
The God of the Ocean uses
the Sacred Totems to send his messages.

119
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,650
You will receive your challenge here.

120
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,050
This is...

121
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,250
the scent of a Grand Soul Master!

122
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,980
Master Seahorse.

123
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,050
Some foreign land soul masters are here
to accept the challenge.

124
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,850
Land soul masters want to take
the God of the Ocean's challenge?

125
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,810
You will only be qualified to do that

126
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,510
if you go through the Sea Within a Sea

127
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,980
and stand in front of the Seahorse Totem.

128
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,850
Does that mean we have to accept the challenge

129
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,710
of a Grand Soul Master

130
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,280
before the God of the Ocean?

131
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,750
The challenge for a land soul master

132
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,210
is different from the one for ocean soul masters.

133
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,680
Master Seahorse

134
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
is acting on God of the Ocean's order.

135
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,010
Then

136
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,680
let me try first.

137
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,150
Third Soul Skill,

138
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,380

Mu Bai.

142
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,210
Brother Dai is protecting himself
with White Tiger Vajra Transformation

143
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,250
to walk through the sea.

144
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,080
The Sea Within a Sea is not deep.

145
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,480
With his skills,

146
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,750
walking in the sea
for a short period of time

147
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,510
is not a problem.

148
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,310
Passing my challenge with your third skill

149
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,010
and you're still at a young age.

150
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,980
To land soul masters,

151
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,980
you are one of the top among soul emperors.

152
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,110
Alright.

153
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,150
You are qualified to accept
the God of the Ocean's challenge.

154
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,010
Thank you.

155
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,610
Great!

156
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,950
Since Brother Dai has taken care of
most of the ocean soul beasts,

157
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,580
these waves are nothing to be afraid of.

158
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,880
Let's go together.

159
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,350
Jiubao, reinforced with Amber!

160
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,810

along with soul masters from
the Food, Keen Attack, and Agility Branches.

165
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,880
Such young geniuses...

166
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,350
Could it be...?

167
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,180
Since you have crossed the Sea Within a Sea,

168
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,750
you are all qualified to accept
the God of the Ocean's challenge.

169
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,880
But

170
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,910
if you're from the Martial Soul Hall,

171
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,150
please go back.

172
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,480
You are not welcome here.

173
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,280
Senior.

174
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,050
We are not from the Martial Soul Hall.

175
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,610
Rong Rong is from the Qibao Amber Tribe.

176
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,810
San is from the Hao Tian Tribe.

Xiang is a disciple of the Tribe of Agility.

179
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,080
Ao and Fatty are free soul masters.

180
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,850
Since you have different backgrounds
and come from different places,

181
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,050
how did you all get together?

182
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,210
Because we are all students of Shrek School.

183
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,950
As far as I know,

184
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,780
most of the powerful land soul masters

185
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,910
come from the Martial Soul Hall.

186
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,010
I've never heard of any Shrek School.

187
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,550
At least make up something convincing
if you're going to lie.

188
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,280
This...

189
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,180
Even though it's weak,

190
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,350
why is the God of the Ocean's energy
coming from him?

191
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,810
I can't defy orders from the God of the Ocean.

192
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,080
Everyone.

193
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,150
Please excuse me for my rudeness earlier.

194
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,280
We will start the God of the Ocean's challenge

195
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,510
right away.

196
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,650
His attitude changed so quickly.

197
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,410
Maybe the Vast Sea and Universe Shield

198
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,180
contains energy that he is scared of.

199
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,480
No matter what, at least
we can take the challenge now.

200
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,450
Who wants to go first?

201
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,050
Senior.

202
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,450
Please start the God of the Ocean's
challenge for me.

203
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,110
Follow me.

208
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,550
Black Level Six Tests?

209
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,880
Even two levels higher than what I used to have!

210
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,550
Senior.

211
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,550
What is that? Black Level Six Tests?

212
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,980
The God of the Ocean
will set different level tests

213
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,380
based on test takers' power and potential.

214
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,250
From low to high,

215
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,150
they are White Level One Test,

216
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,510
Yellow Level One Test,

217
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,880
Purple Level One to Three Tests,

218
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,380
Black Level Four to Six Tests,

219
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,280
and Red Top-tier Tests.

220
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,080
If you pass the White, Yellow,
and Purple Level tests,

221
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,110
you can become a soul master
of the corresponding level and guard the island.

222
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,950
The black level tests match the status
of the guardians of the Seven Sacred Totems.

223
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,950
Red level matches
the level of the heir of the Head Flamen.

224
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,180
Congratulations, Brother Dai!

225
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,950
But...

226
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,150
you definitely can't pass it
with your current power.

227
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,350
You will die for sure.

228
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,150
Why do you say that?

229
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,680
Over the past one hundred years,

230
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,510
the black level test
has been set 31 times.

231
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,280
But only seven people passed.

232
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Those seven became the guardians
of the Seven Sacred Totems.

233
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,850
I am one of them.

234
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,110
Land soul masters have to complete
one test in one year

235
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,080
while soul masters on Haishen Island
have ten years for each.

236
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,310
Even then,

237
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,810
my Black Level Four Tests
took almost 40 years

238
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,810
and I almost died multiple times.

239
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,280
Among the seven of us,

240
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,950
only Grand Sea Dragon Master
passed the Black Level Six Tests.

241
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,710
If you run out of time or try to run away,

242
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,550
then

243
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,850
the God of the Ocean's seal
on your forehead will explode.

244
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,250
It's not too late to leave.

245
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,910
Senior.

246
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,250
Even if we die, we won't give up.

247
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,150
God of the Ocean,
please give us the challenge!

248
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,710
God of the Ocean,
please give us the challenge!

249
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,480
In that case,

250
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,780
your destiny will be determined
by the God of the Ocean.
