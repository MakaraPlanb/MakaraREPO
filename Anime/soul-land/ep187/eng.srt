00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,800
[Previous episode]

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,630
The Demon Tiger Whale King's power
is extremely potent. Be careful.

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,360
I will never surrender to you!

34
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,260
I would rather die
than work with Martial Soul Empire!

35
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,390
On this continent,
only the Empire is legitimate.

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,390
If anyone rebels against the Empire,
this will be your fate.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,230
I know pretty well about the Grand Ocean Masters
of the Seven Sacred Totems.

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,730
The first thing you need to do
is to understand your opponent.

39
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,060
How about I help you train?

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,550
[Episode 187]

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,930
Little Bai, are you here
to help us train?

42
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,160
Then let's get started.

43
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,360
There's no rush.

44
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,760
Previously, you battled as a team.
This time, it's more about individual skills.

45
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,630
You need to first experience your shortcomings
in order to find a solution.

46
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,760
We've battled against many opponents,

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,430
but never ourselves.

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,890
Bai, what should we do?

49
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,760
Based on your different tests,

50
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,030
Oscar, Ma Hong Jun, Zhu Zhu Qing,
and Dai Mu Bai,

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,190
you will take turns fighting Tang San.

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,130
Rong Rong will support you.

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,690
Ever since Tang San received
his eighth soul ring,

54
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,060
his power is on par with a normal
Grand Soul Master.

55
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,430
You also understand each other well.

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,960
You can find each other's weaknesses

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,960
and problems more easily.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,230
Let's start.

59
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,530
Blue Silver Domain Skill,
Majestic Nature!

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,090
Jiubao Boosts!

61
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,730
Rong Rong's amplification almost
canceled out the Blue Silver Domain.

62
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,460
Let's see how they do.

63
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,360
I'll go first!

64
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,390
Teleport.

65
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,560
San, what are you going to do?

66
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,260
Tang San accurately found
Oscar's weakest moment

67
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,590
before he eats a Mirror Copy Sausage.

68
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,360
Next.

69
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,160
My turn. Brother San, be careful!

70
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,530
Invincible Golden Shield.

71
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,090
Vast Sea and Universe Shield!

72
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,430
As a Sensitivity Soul Master,
Zhu Zhu Qing's advantage is speed.

73
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,790
But she exposed her formations
to her opponent too early.

74
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,930
Fatty, your turn.

75
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,560
Brother San, don't go too hard on me.

76
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,390
Sixth Soul Skill,

77
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,890
Phoenix Piercing Strike!

78
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:37,930
Teleport.

79
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:39,990
Oh no!

80
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,560
I don't have time for the next attack!

81
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,360
As a Controlling Soul Master,

82
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,830
Tang San has strong control
over his own soul skills.

83
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,090
If you continuously attack in his domain,

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,430
you'll not only not break the domain,
but also expose yourself.

85
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,060
Brother Dai, come on.

86
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,890
It's San's Swallowing Gold Threads.

87
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,860
I can't let it suck out my soul power.
I need to break free fast.

88
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,430
Sixth Soul Skill,

89
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,960
Tiger Wiping Kill!

90
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,260
Demon Tiger's Left Leg Soul Bone Skill,

91
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,460
Tiger Whale Demon Axe!

92
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,760
It's Tang San's new soul bone skill.

93
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,260
In this head-on battle,

94
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,290
both of them must unleash
their strongest attacks.

95
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,690
Boss Dai's attacks are strong,

96
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,730
so I must use
my strongest limitation skills.

97
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,690
Eighth Soul Skill,
Blue Silver Demon Mirror Destruction!

98
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,430
This is my new Eighth Soul Skill.

99
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,430
It can use a vision to limit
my opponent's vision.

100
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,260
Who knew that Tang San's new skill
would be so overbearing?

101
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,660
Mu Bai.

102
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,030
If that was a real battle,

103
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,490
you would've all been heavily wounded.

104
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,930
If you first made clones of yourself
and then ate the sausage,

105
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,130
Tan Sang wouldn't have been able
to control you right away.

106
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,890
That's right.

107
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,890
Zhu Qing also made a mistake too.

108
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,590
A Sensitivity Soul Master's biggest advantage
is their attack and speed,

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,860
but defense is a weakness.

110
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,790
When you are against a strong opponent,
you shouldn't pause.

111
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,760
The moment your opponent
sees your form, you'll be in danger.

112
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,060
And you two.

113
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,630
Attacking your opponent head on
within their domain isn't beneficial.

114
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,930
Sometimes you need to retreat
in order to advance.

115
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,530
As for Tang San, your power and skills
are unquestionable.

116
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,890
But the one-against-seven fight
has a time limit.

117
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,790
You need to try even harder.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,890
Thank you for your guidance, Bai.

119
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,030
Don't be discouraged, everyone.
With our skills now,

120
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,560
as long as we overcome
our own shortcomings,

121
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,360
we still have a big chance to pass.

122
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,630
-Okay!
-Okay!

123
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,430
Your Majesty!

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
We lost Gengxin Town!

125
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,130
[Martial Soul Empire]

126
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,330
That darn Martial Soul Empire

127
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,570
almost killed the entire
Ironsmiths Society!

128
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:09,960
Si Long.

129
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,230
Old Gorilla.

130
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,960
No news might be good news.

131
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,590
At least there's a possibility
that he's still alive.

132
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,490
I already sent someone to investigate.

133
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,590
As long as he's alive,
we will definitely bring him back.

134
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:06,970
[Soul Land]

135
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,990
Next, I will simulate battle
with each of you,

136
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,030
and help you get used
to the Grand Masters' skills through battle.

137
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,160
-Okay!
-Okay!

138
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,860
Who wants to go first?

139
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,160
Allow me.

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,260
It seems like they've already
found a solution.

141
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,790
Who would've expected such progress
in such a short amount of time?

142
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,130
Their ideas are good,

143
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,860
but there is still a big difference
between simulation and reality.

144
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,390
How much further can they get?

145
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,090
After these simulation battles,

146
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,760
they were able to overcome themselves
in such a short amount of time.

147
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,330
You've all worked hard lately.

148
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,430
There's nothing more I can teach you.

149
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,260
Go attempt the test tomorrow.

150
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,030
That's great!

151
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,760
After three years, you've all
gotten much more powerful.

152
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,060
Are you here today for the Fifth Test?

153
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,830
Yes. Senior, please enlighten us.

154
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,030
Once the test starts,

155
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,660
you must defeat us
Seven Grand Ocean Masters

156
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,090
one by one within 72 hours.

157
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,860
During the test, we won't use
the power of the Totems.

158
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,790
We will only test you with our own power.

159
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,490
Thank you, Senior.

160
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,330
These flames represent your time limit.

161
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,960
When they all go out,
your 72 hours are up.

162
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,790
Please.

163
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,160
He got two more Century Millennium
Soul Rings again in the past three years.

164
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,760
Senior, be careful.

165
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,530
God Killer Domain, Demon Hell!

166
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,990
Besides your soul skills, Tang San
and Fatty have domains.

167
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,730
With the support of Rong Rong,

168
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,960
everyone else will also have domain skills.

169
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,690
Remember to use this to your advantage.

170
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Amongst the Seven Grand Ocean Masters,

171
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,130
only the Grand Sea Delusion Master
and Grand Sea Dragon Master have this skill.

172
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,460
Bai, thank you for your advice.

173
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,330
We are going to challenge
Grand Seahorse Master first.

174
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,530
Do you have any suggestions?

175
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,790
Even though you are very familiar
with the Grand Seahorse Master,

176
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,730
his power far exceeds your expectations.

177
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,930
Especially pay attention
to his Ninth Soul Skill.

178
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,960
If you can, don't let him use it.

179
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,760
I need to do everything to stop the Grand
Seahorse Master from using his Ninth Soul Skill.

180
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,560
Starting with a domain to limit me.

181
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,060
Tang San, this is a good idea.

182
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,090
But your power is nowhere near enough.

183
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,460
Sixth Soul Skill,

184
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,160
Sky and Ocean Crazy Blue Shield!

185
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,530
Oh no, Demon Hell
is completely neutralized.

186
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,930
He managed to suppress San's power
even without a domain.

187
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,960
The Grand Seahorse Master
really is powerful.

188
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,390
Fifth Soul Skill,

189
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,560
Furious Ocean Wave Punch!

190
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,360
You won't be able to escape.

191
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,830
I need to conserve soul power
and not attack head-on.

192
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,160
Teleport.

193
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,090
It's a Soul Skill Lockdown.

194
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,090
An ineffective attack. My soul power
is clearly above his,

195
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,660
but I didn't gain any advantage.

196
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,630
It's Invincible Golden Shield.

197
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,730
I need to accumulate more soul power.

198
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,690
Blue Silver Domain, Majestic Nature!

199
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,460
It's that move?

200
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,330
Brother San's soul power
is quickly increasing.

201
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,230
I can't let him accumulate anymore

202
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,490
or else I'll be at a severe disadvantage.

203
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,890
He can even absorb this?

204
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,530
Amazing!

205
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,060
As long as Brother San
keeps up his domain,

206
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,060
he'll eventually absorb all of
the Grand Seahorse Master's soul power.

207
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,930
He'll win by default.

208
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,760
Tang San, I promised Master Bo Sai Xi
to not go easy on you.

209
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,530
Don't blame me.

210
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,330
Ninth Soul Skill!

211
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,760
Oh no!
