27 days to finish the challenge.

35
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,750
It's almost been a month.

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,380
Go join your friends.

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,110
But I will decide

38
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,580
my own destiny.

39
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,010
The pain of skipping levels to absorb a soul ring

40
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,850
is not bearable by most,

41
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,350
much less the careless Fatty.

42
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,610
I will appear again when the next person

43
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,710
is stuck.

44
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,780
Let's strike while the iron is hot
and keep cultivating.

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,750
Cultivating on and off

46
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,580
has the best effect.

[Episode 173]

48
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,750
San's method indeed works.

49
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,150
Everyone passed level 50 in just a month.

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,750

51
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,610
growing from level 20 to 53

52
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,480
and improving at the speed of light.

53
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,080
San, don't be so humble.

54
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,650
You're already at level 80,

55
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,050
truly a weirdo.

56
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Xiang, I knew you could do it!

57
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,510
Why are you blushing?

58
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,810
It has nothing to do with you!

59
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,350
Xiang, congratulations
on passing the challenge.

60
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,480
We're going to cultivate in the Light of
the God of the Ocean until the deadline.

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,910
Do you want to climb with us?

62
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:42,550
Can...

63
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,450
Can I?

64
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,010
But I didn't get the same challenge you did.

65
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,880
That doesn't mean you can't try.

66
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,880
Even though the Light creates high pressure,

67
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,480
it is also very beneficial to
increasing soul power.

68
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,480
Don't give up on this opportunity.

69
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,350
Okay.

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,380
Tang San.

71
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,910
I hope you can grow quickly

72
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,980
and not disappoint the God of the Ocean.

73
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,180
Your opponent won't be waiting
for you to grow stronger.

74
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,710
Body of light and heart like a sword.

75
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,780
The descendant of the angel
brings the challenge with her.

76
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,250
(Soul power really does increase quickly
when we cultivate in the Light.)

77
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,850
(In just two months,)

78
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,350
(my soul power surpassed level 69.)

79
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,750
(But level 70...)

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,980
(After two months, my soul power
is finally at level 50.)

81
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,450
(I'm still far from everyone else,)

82
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,380
(but I won't give up on cultivating.)

83
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,250

84
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,280
-San!
-Brother San!

85
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,710
I passed it!

86
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,050
You have reached level 70.

87
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,050
I will now give you the God-given Soul Ring.

88
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,980
Last time, I used all my effort
for a Four Decade Millennium Soul Ring.

89
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,050
Who knows where Brother San's limit is?

90
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,450

(The quality of the seventh soul ring)

94
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,750
(directly affects the power of the Innate Domain.)

95
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,150
(The level of the God-given Soul Ring
depends on how much the receiver can handle.)

96
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,250
(I need to give it my all)

97
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,780
(to find my limit.)

98
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,350
No wonder you were chosen by the God of the Ocean.

99
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,117
You started with your full power

100
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,650
and began the challenge
at a higher starting point.

101
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,650
Not only will you not waste any soul power,

102
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,650
your body's tenacity and healing

103
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,610
will all increase with the soul bone.

104

Brother San!

105
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,410
Believe in San.

106
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,480
He's continuously about to collapse,

107
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,310
but he perseveres every time.

108
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,210
What kind of power is sustaining him?

109
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,850

He's alright.

113
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,650
He will wake up after some time.

114
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,910
(San already broke through his upper limit.)

115
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,210
(But where are our limits?)

116
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,950
Look at this.

117

Here, over here.

118
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,780
Okay, carefully now.

119
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,280
(We're now able to mass-produce
basic hidden weapons.)

120
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,580
(If Lou Gao can create top-tier hidden weapons,)

121
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,250
