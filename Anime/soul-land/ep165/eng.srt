00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,030
Something's wrong.

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,430
You said to get there as soon as possible,

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,030
so I kept going straight at full speed.

35
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,890
But now we're in the Magic Whales' territory!

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,730
Are you crazy?

37
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,130
Do you want to die?

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,560
They say

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,830
that the Magic Whale is too strong,

40
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,760
so the Ocean Master blinded his left eye.

41
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,260

transforming into a dragon

00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,760
and broke the ten-thousand-year limit,

74
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,790

passed out on the beach yesterday,

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,090

I don't know if the others still are.

132

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,230
Get some rest first.

145
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,960
after absorbing power from the
Magic Whale King of the Deep Sea,

148
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,460
It's creating a huge burden for my body.

149
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,030
I need to quickly finish absorbing it
and go find the others.

150
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,330
Even the strongest ocean soul beasts

151
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,460
might not be able to recover like him.

152

Please save my brother.

158
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,060
What should I do?

159
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,430
I don't have any soul power.

160
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,030
I can't insert the needle deep enough

161
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,430
to fully seal his vessels.

162
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,430
Let me try.

163
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,460

please move aside.

167
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,790
Let him try.

168
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,230
Amazing!

169
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,690

Even though he has no soul power,

171
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,060
every needle he's inserted is fast and sharp.

172
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,790
Seems that silver needle

173
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,460
should be his martial soul.

174
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,160

00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,060

then bring some medicine for me
when you're back next time.

179
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,290
Of course.

180
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,090

181
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,190
My apologies for earlier.

182
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,690
I'll treat you to a drink next time.

183
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,230
Sure.

184
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,760
Thank you for earlier.

185
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,930
It was easy. No trouble at all.

186
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm really ashamed.

187
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,460
They call me a magic doctor,

188
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,060
but I can't even seal a blood vessel.

189
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,030
I'm really just an incompetent doctor.

190
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,960
Then do you

191
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,390
want to learn the method I used
to seal his vessel just now?

192
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,730
I can't.

193
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,460
Your method requires soul power,

194
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,090
but I was born with none.

195
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,960
No matter what martial soul I have,

196
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,490
I can't increase my soul power with cultivation.

197
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,130
What if

198
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,690
I could increase your soul power?

199
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:41,790
You...

200
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,460
