49

Rong Rong, thank you for being with me
these past few days.

50
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,983
You gave it your all

51
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,683

53
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,517
Back then, Brother Dai gave all his effort
to absorb the God-given Soul Ring for Zhu Qing.

54
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,250
I was very touched.

55
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,983
He told me before

56
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:47,150
that he was willing
to lay down his life for Zhu Qing.

00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:49,883
Even if I can't pass
the clan test later on,

58
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,583
I will rescue her

59
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,250
even if I die.

60
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:55,450
That's right.

61
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:57,483
Since I was little,

62
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,150
there's only been one person in my heart.

63
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,917
But compared to Ao,

64
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,450
I'm still not as good.

65
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:12,583
Are they flattering each other?

66
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,583
They're really shameless.

00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,817
You...You've really told Ao that?

68
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,017
The longer we are together,

together with you.

90
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:42,883
We've taken enough of a break.

91
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,883
It's time to begin the second test.

92
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,217
We first need to figure out what
ocean soul beasts exist in the Round Ocean.

93
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:59,750
You guys stay on the shore,
I'll go down and take a look.

94
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,550
San.

95
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:03,017
(Something's wrong. My support is weakened.)

96
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,583
(Something's wrong. There is a special
power stopping me in the water,)

97
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,550
(and increasing my soul power usage.)

98
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,383
(Arrow Fish Ocean Beast.)

99
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:21,817
This is so unfair.

100
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:24,550
Brother San doesn't have
an attack advantage in the water,

101
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,683
and we can't kill any ocean soul beasts
in this test.

102
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:30,883
What will Brother San do?

103
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,517
(I've only gone 20 meters into the Round Ocean.)

104
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:48,483
(These Arrow Fish are definitely
not the only challenge.)

105
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,683
(I need to finish them quickly.)

106
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:25,917
(These Arrow Fish are not scary.)

107
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:28,983
(The Round Ocean is what's
exhausting my soul power.)

108
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,383
(It's time to stop playing.)

109
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,483
(Hao Tian Nine Extremes.)

[Shock]

111
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:51,483
(Shock Form!)

112
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,550
(They are too scared to attack again.)

113
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,383
(What's going on?
There's a weird surge happening.)

114
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,017
(Why did I teleport such little distance?)

115
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:24,617
San!

116
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:25,450
Brother San!

117
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:29,850
San! Are you alright?

118
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,583
I'm fine.

119
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,717
But the ocean is too restricting.
I can usually teleport 100 meters,

120
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,117
yet then I could only teleport 5 meters.

121
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:39,583
Also, the ocean soul beast
at the end was shockingly fast.

122
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:41,583
I didn't even see it clearly.

123
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:45,417
We managed to see it. It was a white shark.

124
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,250
It appeared and disappeared
in the blink of an eye.

125
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:50,950
You were thrown out after.

126
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:53,050
A white shark?

127
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:57,083
Its large volume didn't affect
its agility at all.

128
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:02,750
It looked a lot like the Devil White Shark
Purple Pearl and Ji Xiang mentioned before.

129
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:05,550
Rong Rong gave her full support just now,

130
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,550
but you were still thrown out by it
with one wave.

131
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,283
It can't just be
a normal Devil White Shark.

132
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:13,350
Could it be

133
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,317
a Protection Beast,
the Devil White Shark King?

134
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:21,183
But it guards the outer border
of Haishen Island.

135
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,550
How did it get into the Round Ocean?

136
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,650
Since there are multiple inner oceans
on the island,

137
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:30,283
there must be tunnels
connecting the outer ocean underneath.

138
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,150
But it didn't seem to intend to hurt us,

139
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:34,817
it's only stopping us from crossing the ocean.

140
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:36,617
If it launches lethal attacks,

141
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:38,617
we won't be able to get out unharmed.

142
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,417
With the Devil White Shark King
guarding the Round Ocean,

143
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,417
the second test is very difficult.

144
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:48,050
But we just need to break out
of the barrier, not overpower it.

145
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:52,050
Maybe this is a good chance
to increase our battle experience.

146
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,450
Brother San, do you actually want us to fight that?

147
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,450
Is there any better training

148
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,250
than fighting a century
millennium soul beast

149
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,117
that won't hurt us

150
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:05,950
in highly restrictive waters?

151
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,517
Right! It's like the first test.

152
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:10,083
This is a fantastic cultivation opportunity.

153
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,783
We'll get to learn how to swim.
