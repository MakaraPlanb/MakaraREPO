[Previous episode]

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,830
I am entrusting
my only dear granddaughter to you.

33
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,490
From now on, I will forever
be by your side.

34
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,960
They're heavily poisoned

35
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,760
and their consciousness
is almost completely gone.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,230
We need to trust them.

37
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,330
We need to activate
all of my Phoenix Power in order to win.

38
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,360
Is this all the power you have?

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,830
Senior, please begin.

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,830
Senior, we took a shortcut.

41
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,690
You are indeed powerful.
You have passed.

42
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,830
I will do my best
to protect Haishen Island.

[Episode 193]

44
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,890
I have never forgotten
your recognition of my abilities.

45
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,360
The current situation calls for us
to stay even more united

46
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,330
to defeat the enemy.

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,560
I came this time

48
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,930
to work together with
the Tian Dou Imperial School.

49
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,920
Mr. Qin,

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,130
His Majesty values Shrek School
the most now.

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,590
You are not lacking resources or talent.

52
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,760
Why work together with us?

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,060
There are many free soul masters
in the Continent

54
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,790
that rejected
Martial Soul Empire's invitation

55
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,460
and are revolting against their brutality.

56
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,460
His Majesty is planning
to work with all powers

57
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,960
and create a few highly trained team
of soul masters.

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
However,

59
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,090
many free soul masters
are not used to fighting in a team,

60
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,430
much less in an army.

61
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,560
Even if Master can create a creative strategy,

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,330
how we convince the soul masters
to study and familiarize themselves with it

63
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,230
is still a big problem.

64
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,930
And that is what we're good at.

65
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,920
That's right. We highly value

66
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Tian Dou Imperial School's teaching staff.

67
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,830
With your teachings,

68
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,860
we can definitely
train a team of strong soldiers.

69
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,130
-Sir, we also want to fight Martial Soul Empire!
-Sir, we also want to fight Martial Soul Empire!

70
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,790
Very good!

71
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,260
If His Majesty and Master both trust us,

72
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,030
there's nothing left holding us back.

73
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,260
This is a worthy way for us

74
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,490
to be involved in the revolt.

75
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,290
Senior, please.

76
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,690
I am Tang San,

77
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,490
coming to challenge you in this Fifth Test

78
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,660
of the God of the Ocean's Nine Tests.

79
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,760
Even though Wu's soul and body

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,430
can combine for four hours,

81
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,160
she already used up half the time
in the previous battles.

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,530
We still need to face the strongest
Grand Sea Dragon Master after.

83
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,890
We must finish this battle
as quickly as possible.

84
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,730
Seventh Soul Skill,

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,760
Martial Soul Form!

86
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,660
So many tentacles! How is this a sea star?

87
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,930
This is a sea monster!

88
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,730
He must have realized how powerful we were

89
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,090
from the previous battles,

90
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,190
and went on the offensive.

91
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,430
The Grand Sea Star Master
is also a controlling soul master.

92
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,560
The best way to defeat a high level
controlling soul master

93
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,130
is to control his control.

94
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,760
Three Century Millennium Soul Rings?

95
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,990
Swallow?

96
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,290
The tentacles have suckers on them.

97
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,390
Not only are they sucking onto
my Blue Silver Emperor,

98
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,960
they are also swallowing my soul power.

99
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,130
Seventh Soul Skill,

100
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,630
Blue Silver Form!

101
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,730
God Killer Attack!

102
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,760
I'm slowly losing soul power.
We can't remain at a standstill like this.

103
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,060
Fifth Soul Skill,
Blue Silver Emperor Tyrant Spear!

104
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,520
Trying to conserve your power?
That's useless!

105
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,290
Out of all of my solo attack skills,

106
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,260
only the Blue Silver Emperor Tyrant Spear
will focus on attacking one point.

107
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,930
With the same amount of power,

108
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,130
its attack is the strongest.

109
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,730
Great!

110
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,630
Don't be too happy just yet.

111
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,060
Fifth Soul Skill, Regeneration!

112
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,090
He can regenerate?

113
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
If he can regenerate, it won't matter
how many tentacles I cut off.

114
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,560
Oh, no.

115
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,230
The mucus on his tentacles
has a numbing effect.

116
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,830
I can't remain at a standstill.

117
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,560
Majestic Nature!

118
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,660
Swallowing Gold Threads!

119
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,990
Majestic Nature is the Blue Silver Domain's
evolved domain.

120
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,030
As an innate domain,

121
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,930
it can greatly amplify
the martial soul form.

122
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,060
Let's see whose swallowing power
is stronger.

123
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,830
He really is a Grand Soul Master

124
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,760
and has stronger swallowing power than me.

125
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,690
Don't be dumb, Tang San.
Haven't you noticed?

126
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,390
The more contact I have,

127
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,360
the stronger my swallowing power is.

128
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,790
As the God of the Ocean's heir,
you really disappointed me.

129
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,460
Let me end this farce.

130
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,590
Ninth Soul Skill, Tidal Wave Gravity!

131
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,490
Where is this?

132
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,460
My body feels so light.
There's nothing around here.

133
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,060
The loss of my soul power sped up over ten times.

134
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,060
Brother San was swallowed by a tentacle!

135
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,660
Oh, no.

136
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,030
The strong gravity
of the Grand Sea Star Master's Ninth Soul Skill

137
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,360
can also affect someone's spirit.

138
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,990
Tang San won't feel the changes in his body.

139
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,360
If his spirit can't break free from control,

140
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,560
Tang San will never come out again.

141
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,830
-San!
-Brother San!

142
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,560
Brother!

143
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,590
It's everyone's voice.

144
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,860
This place is like a maze
and I can't see the exit.

145
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,960
I will have to try.

146
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,690
I'm losing soul power continuously
and can't use my soul skills.

147
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,260
My body is getting weaker.

148
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,890
No matter where this is,
I have to get out.

149
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,520
That is?

150
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:14,730
[Soul Land]

151
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,630
Tang San is losing soul power
at a slower rate than before.

152
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,330
Come out!

153
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,090
You found me this quickly?

154
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,990
I made marks within the maze.

155
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,690
Do you think it'll help if you find me?

156
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,230
Fourth Soul Skill, Violent Roar!

157
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,490
What is that sound? My ears hurt!

158
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,020
Tang San, you can't defeat me.

159
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,490
Wu!

160
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,460
Brother, I'm here to help you.

161
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,530
You need to be careful too.

162
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,390
You work very well together,
but it's all for nothing.

163
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,060
You thought I left the marks to find you?

164
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,890
Out of all the tentacles, one is unmarked

165
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,430
and hasn't attacked me at all.

166
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,230
Oh, no!

167
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,660
That is his weakest spot.

168
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,560
Oh no, I have no more soul power.

169
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,890
Brother!

170
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,160
Wu, teleport me there.

171
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,630
Teleport!

172
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,790
What a last-ditch effort.

173
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,590
Eighth Soul Skill, Fusion!

174
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,060
Sixth Soul Skill, Instant Destruction!

175
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,460
Invincible Golden Shield!

176
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,530
Oh no.

177
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,590
What is this?

178
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,360
After numerous evolutions,
the Eight Spider Bone's power

179
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,130
is no less than
a century millennium soul bone.

180
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,290
Brother, you got this!

181
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,160
My soul power!

182
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,220
Good job, Brother San!

183
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,460
Give him a taste of his own medicine!

184
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,890
Senior, admit defeat.

185
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,290
I can clearly feel your heartbeat.

186
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,230
If you continue,
you'll be heavily injured.

187
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,430
I admit defeat.

188
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,790
Thank you. I will transfer back
the vitality I absorbed.

189
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,830
This is your attached soul bone?

190
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,360
What an attached soul bone.

191
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,760
Who knew that even my proudest
Swallow Skill would lose to you?

192
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,160
You won.

193
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,430
Tang San has passed
the Sea Star Totem's Test.

194
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,860
Wu passes as accompaniment.

195
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,160
Brother, this is great!

196
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,430
Thank you, Senior.

197
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,190
What is that? A mermaid?

198
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,830
So beautiful!

199
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,330
This battle is Zhu Qing's last test.

200
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,430
Zhu Qing,

201
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,730
don't force yourself during the test.

202
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,330
If you can't win, then save your energy
and admit defeat.

203
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,330
Once I defeat the Grad Sea Enchantress,

204
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,660
you can try again

205
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,930
to win the battle.

206
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,930
Zhu Qing.

207
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,660
Thank you, Brother San.

208
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,790
But I believe that I will win.

209
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,260
You already did so much for us
during the earlier tests.

210
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,530
It's my turn to repay you.

211
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,560
Don't forget, besides you and Mu Bai,

212
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,360
I have the highest soul power.

213
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,890
Zhu Qing indeed never admits defeat easily.

214
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,260
We win all of our battles

215
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,730
for the same reason.

216
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,990
As always.

217
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,130
You're right, Zhu Qing.

218
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,190
-Shrek will win!
-Shrek will win!

219
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,960

that is not even known by Yu Xiao Gang.

You'll pass if you listen
to the entire song.
