187
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,560
we have to leave now.

188
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,160
Good luck with everything.

189
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,790
We are here.

190
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,390
Grand Sea Lance Master has been waiting for you.

191
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:04,700
This way, please.

192
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,830
Thanks.

193
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,330
It's harder

194
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,760
for a tool soul master
to become a Grand Soul Master

195
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,790
than a beast soul master.

196
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,660
Therefore,

197
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,930
a Grand Tool Soul Master

198
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,190
is usually more powerful than
a Grand Beast Soul Master.

199
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,830
That's why Grand Sea Lance Master

200
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,490
is just less strong than
Grand Sea Dragon Master.

201
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,130
Brother Dai,

202
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,690
Rong Rong,

203
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,730
please be careful.

204
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,730
-You can do it!
-You got this!

205
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,790
We'll get going now.

206
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,060
I need to save as much time as possible for San.

207
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,030
Little Bai,

208
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,060
why are you here?

209
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,760
I want to witness the fight of the strong ones.

210
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,330
Do you have any advice

211
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,330
for fighting with Grand Sea Lance Master?

212
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,960
Grand Sea Lance Master is a tool soul master,
which is rare among Seven Grand Ocean Masters.

213
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,430
His martial soul is Nanuke Lance.

214
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,130
This kind of lance was firstly used for hunting
whales under the ice in the far north.

215
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,930
Later on, it was blessed by the God of the Ocean,

216
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,360
and became a tool soul that is rare
among ocean soul masters.

The Grand Sea Lance Master's
Ninth Skill is a single attack.

253
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,330
Once you are locked,

254
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,460
you won't be able to dodge it.

255
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,260
The only one on Haishen Island
that can take it,

256
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,030
is probably the Grand Ocean Master, Bo Sai Xi.

you must have the answer now.
