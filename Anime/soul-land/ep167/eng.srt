32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,190
I can teach you a cultivating method

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,430
that might help you become a soul master.

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,830
You're brave to be making trouble
for my Purple Pearl Pirates!

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,590
Let go of Wu.

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,660
The strongest is the leader, Purple Pearl.

38
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,790
She is a level 68 soul emperor,

39
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,390
and has about 40 ships.

40
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,390
Teacher, don't kill her!

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,160
We were attacked by the Chill Poison.

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,190
Even my Phoenix Flames couldn't melt it.

43
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,960
Leader Pearl rescued us after.

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,430

You want to catch me
without using soul skills?

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,160
Fine, I'll take that bet.

00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,890
Wait!

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
We can do whatever we want with you!

Excuse me, excuse me.

53
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,360
Teacher, you're finally back.

54
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,730
San, where is Purple Pearl?

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,630
He didn't capture our leader, so he lost!

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,490
Young man, don't be too arrogant.

57
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,790
The entire ocean is ours.
Do you think you are that powerful?

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,460
Go!

59
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,390
Let me out!

60
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,090
It's our leader!

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,660
You conniving villain!

Let me out if you dare!

64
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,030

71
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,230
So what if I lost? I admit it!

72
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,130
You are my boss from now on.

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,660
Boss...

74
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,590
Everyone, go back and rest.

75
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,730
Boss.

76
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,690
Our island is full of natural produce.

77
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,090
You can ask for whatever you want.

78
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,600

79
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,280
Your disciple is pretty good.

80
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,390
I was able to survive this time

81
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,360
all thanks to him.

82
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,090
After you guys recover,

83
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,690
we will continue towards Haishen Island.

84
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,590
You are going to Haishen Island?

85
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:03,560
Yes.

86
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,390
Actually, I came from Haishen Island.

87
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,230
Ji Xiang,

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,760
you said earlier

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,860
that you came from Haishen Island?

90
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,730
Yes.

91
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,590
In order to stay on the island,

92
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,930
you have to pass
the God of the Ocean's test.

93
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,460
I was born without soul power

94
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,130
and wouldn't have passed,

95
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,060
so my parents sent me here

96
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,030
under the care of Leader Purple Pearl.

97
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,260
Teacher,

98
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,290
you shouldn't go.

99
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,690
Haishen Island is a sacred place where
ocean soul masters worship the God of the Ocean.

100
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,490
Lots of foreign ocean soul masters
have died during the test.

101
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,460
Much less land soul masters.

102
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,360
Even if you pass,

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,560
you have to stay and serve the God of the Ocean

104
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,730
for the rest of your life.

105
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,030
God of the Ocean?

106
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,690
(God of the Ocean.)

107
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,690
The God of the Ocean rules the entire ocean.

108
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Ocean soul masters can control the immense
power of the sea with his blessing.

109
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,690
In the hearts of all ocean soul masters,

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,460
the God of the Ocean is their single and only faith.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,990
There are really

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,030
gods

113
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,590
in this world?

114
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,930
Yes! The God of the Ocean really exists.

115
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,460
Many ocean soul masters have seen
the presence of the God of the Ocean before.

116
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,260
Does he test

117
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,590
by showing his presence?

118
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,030
No.

119
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,160
The God of the Ocean gives prophecies
to the Head Flamen to conduct his tests.

120
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,090
So the test

121
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,190
still comes from a person.

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,530
It's hard to describe.

123
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,590
Only those who go through it

124
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,390
understand.

125
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,660
This...

126
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,930
The Head Flamen is the messenger
for the God of the Ocean,

127
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,490
and leads the strongest ocean soul masters

128
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,460
with his power.

129
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,660
(The Head Flamen...)

130
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,290
(It must be Bo Sai Xi,
the Grand Ocean Master uncle mentioned.)

131
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,960
She can control the power
of the ocean for her own use.

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,190
Unless you're at level 100,

133
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,330
you won't be able to defeat her.

134
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,990
(Even the level 99 Grand Soul Land Master,)

135
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,390
(Tang Chen, lost to her.)

136
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,560
(How likely is it)

137
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,430
(that we win against her?)

138
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,130
(But...)

139
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,090
Ji Xiang,

140
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,790
I understand your intentions.

141
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,430
But for us,

142
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,230
passing the God of the Ocean's test
is our challenge.

143
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,530
How we leave Haishen Island
with our powers

144
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,160
is also a challenge.

145
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,830
I believe that the God of the Ocean does exist.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,930
When someone's power is more
than anyone else's,

147
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,430
they can be called a god.

148
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,460
This God of the Ocean is likely

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,460
an ocean soul master that broke the limit,

150
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
who can control all power in the world

151
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,890
and is more powerful than anyone...

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,190
As a soul master,

153
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,060
this is also our goal.

154
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:13,830
Yes.

155
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:16,460
Yes.

156
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,560
That's right, boss!

157
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Let me take you.

158
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,030
The Purple Pearl is truly great,

159
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,890
much faster than the Sea Devil.

160
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,860
Of course, this is my ship.

161
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,460
But I can only take you here.

162
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,190
Any closer, and I will upset
the God of the Ocean.

163
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,690
I have to think about my brothers too.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,130
I understand.

165
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,130
Boss.

166
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,390
There are many strong ocean soul beasts
near the island,

167
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,860
and several hundred Devil White Sharks.

168
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,690
You will definitely be attacked
if you approach by ship.

169
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,690
What are you going to do?

170
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,430
Devil White Sharks?

171
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:42,600
[Soul Land]

172
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Devil White Sharks are the fiercest
ocean soul beast.

173
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,130
Even if only a millennium old,

174
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,560
they can fight against decade millennium
ocean soul beasts.

175
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,690
The king of the Devil White Sharks

176
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,130
used to be the God of the Ocean's own mount,

177
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,130
a century millennium Protection Beast.

178
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,390
Even though the Protection Beast is not as big
as the Magic Whale King of the Deep Sea,

179
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,290
it's much faster.

180
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,590
No one can escape

181
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,830
its attack.

182
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,430
Then how will we get there?

183
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,160
Devil White Sharks sometimes go out
to hunt together.

184
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,190
But no one knows its habits.

185
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,190
We don't know if they happen
to be out hunting today.

186
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,130
We can't only rely on luck.

187
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,890
But we can try this.

188
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,230
Boss, if you really run into
Devil White Sharks,

189
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,960
never hurt any of them,

190
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,890
or else you will be attacked
by all of them.

191
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,060
Okay.

192
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,260
We're almost there.

193
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,760
We should get going.

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,990
Leader Purple Pearl.

195
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,490
You don't need to take our bet seriously.

196
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,060
Thank you for your hospitality
these past few days.

197
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,730
I have already passed Tang's Clan's
secret skills to Ji Xiang.

198
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,460
Please continue taking care of him.

199
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,590
Don't worry!

200
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,990
Teacher...

201
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,490
Become a real soul master.

202
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,730
Boss! I accept that I lost!

203
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,930
Since I accepted you as my boss,

204
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,830
you will be my boss forever!

205
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,730
You have to come back alive!

206
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,430
Ji Xiang,

207
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,460
they will come back alive,

208
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,360
right?

209
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:28,960
Yes.

210
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,690
Retract the anchor, set sail!

211
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,190
What is this?

212
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,160
Oh, no,

213
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,990
there are decade millennium
ocean soul beasts up ahead!

214
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,690
Even though the Dragon Boat
is surprisingly quick,

215
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,230
it can't stand up to a decade millennium
ocean soul beast.

216
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,160
We have to use the Vast Sea
and Universe Shield's invisibility

217
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,790
to try and avoid a fight.

218
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,260
Vast Sea and Universe Shield, First Skill,

219
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,760
Vast Sea Protection!

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,630
Shush.

221
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,890
Who knew that the Shield
also protects against water?

222
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,990
There's no way for the Dragon Boat
to keep moving forward.

223
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:27,690
Look.

224
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,860
Let's walk along the ocean floor.
