1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,200
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,510
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,790
Asta and the other Black Bulls headed
to the beach town of Raquey

5
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,340
in order to go to the Underwater Temple
that lay deep beneath the water there.

6
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,810
Asta and the other Black
Bulls received an order

7
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,760
to retrieve the magic stone in the temple

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,210
so they can stop the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

9
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,000
who want to separate from the
Clover Kingdom and create their own country.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,950
But...

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,950
Why are you all playing around?!

12
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,250
And you're not?

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,830
C-Captain Yami...

14
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,380
All right, gather round, you idiots.

15
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,130
Apparently the Underwater Temple
really is at the bottom of the ocean.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,260
But the mana kicks up the
ocean currents so much that,

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,600
ordinarily, even a first-class
mage can't get near it.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,390
But on the night of the full moon,

19
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,110
the mana becomes weaker.
We might be able to get in then.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,520
Like the name suggests, the Underwater
Temple is on the ocean floor.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,370
We can't just walk to it.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,590
So Noelle...

23
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,870
Take us there with your water magic.

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,830
Give us a ride there.

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,330
B-But I'd need incredible magic
control in order to do that.

26
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,960
I can't!

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,520
You do it.

28
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,170
The next full moon is a week away.

29
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,970
Learn to control it by then.

30
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,930
Surpass your limits.

31
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,710
The Water Girl Grows Up

32
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,860
Where are you going?

33
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,890
Oh, I just thought I'd let in some fresh air.

34
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,950
I see. So...

35
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,320
What's your foot doing there?

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,950
Hey, now, how did that get there?

37
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,040
This foot is so rude.

38
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,060
You were planning to forget your work
and go out to play, weren't you?

39
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,470
What? Now, why would I go out to play?

40
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,360
I just wanted to go observe some magic—

41
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,890
You don't have time for that!

42
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,080
Please do your work for once!

43
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,740
Hurry up and shut that window!

44
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,620
Right...

45
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,980
Honestly... We haven't even resolved the
incident with the Eye of the Midnight Sun yet.

46
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,180
Don't be so angry, Marx.

47
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,590
You're gonna die young.

48
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,070
And whose fault is that?!

49
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,170
The Eye of the Midnight Sun, eh?

50
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,940
I hope Yami and the others are doing well.

51
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,240
I just hope they aren't fooling around.

52
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,790
I wish I could've gone to
the Underwater Temple.

53
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,460
I feel sick from drinking too much...

54
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,650
I'll be the sun that'll make you shine.

55
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,150
You bastard! How dare you eat my pudding?!

56
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,550
It was yummy!

57
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,900
I wrote my name on it!

58
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,600
Other people's food always tastes better!

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,100
You bastard!

60
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,600
Goodnight, my angel.

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,570
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

62
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,280
Seconds, please!

63
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,780
Knock it off, you assholes!

64
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,770
We're not here to play!
I can't concentrate like this!

65
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,820
I'll kill you all!

66
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,290
Sorry!

67
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,960
What a beautiful voice.
I wonder if she's from Raquey.

68
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,790
It's so beautiful and ethereal...

69
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,120
Are these bubbles magic?

70
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,040
Whoa, is she a water spirit?

71
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,970
Eek! You heard that?

72
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,180
How embarrassing!

73
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,050
Eek!

74
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,610
Oh. She's not like what I'd imagined.

75
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,060
Well, now that you've heard me,
there's no way around it. Let's be friends!

76
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,560
La-dee-dah!

77
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,060
Friends?

78
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,060
I'm Kahono. What are your names?

79
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,880
I'm Noelle. The meathead is Stupidsta.

80
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,140
Who are you calling
"Stupidsta the meathead"?!

81
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,070
Ah, so Noelle and Stupidsta the meathead.

82
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,610
What a strange name.

83
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,580
Wait, don't believe her!
How naïve are you?!

84
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,470
Huh?

85
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,690
That's totally a nickname,
and she's making fun of me!

86
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,310
It's Asta! My name's Asta!

87
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,580
I see. Nice to meet you, Asta!

88
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,460
So what were you doing out here, Kahono?

89
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,810
I was singing.

90
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,170
Well, yeah, I could see that.

91
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,760
I was doing vocal training.

92
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,740
I love singing at this spot.

93
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,090
Training?

94
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,100
Yup! I have a dream!

95
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,730
I want to be a singing,
dancing, magic-using...

96
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,400
idol!

97
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,950
What's an idol?

98
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,400
What?!

99
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,010
You don't know?!

100
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,190
Nope.

101
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,100
They're all the rage in the Common Realm
and Noble Realm right now!

102
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,400
Oh...

103
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,490
Well, you see... So, you see... Well...

104
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,890
Idols are popular people who
can sing, dance, and use magic!

105
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,010
Huh...

106
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,590
I'm going to become a famous
idol and get super rich!

107
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,680
So you're after money?

108
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,760
What's so great about money, anyway?

109
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,630
If you do have it, it's just in the way.

110
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,080
It's not in the way! Money's important!

111
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,180
You've never had to worry about not
having money, so you wouldn't understand.

112
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,430
But money's really important!

113
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,590
You can't eat tatoes without any money!

114
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,690
If you don't have any tatoes,
why don't you just eat steak?

115
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,440
Damned royalty!

116
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,280
Yeah! Money's really important.

117
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,530
I totally understand what Stupidsta's saying!

118
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,600
Seriously, who are you calling "Stupidsta"?!

119
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,680
Was it Kasta?

120
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,370
I told you, it's Asta!

121
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,370
Oh, right. As—Oh?

122
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,040
What?

123
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,790
Stupidsta, your body's weakened.

124
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,170
It's Asta, damn it!

125
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,060
Huh?

126
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,860
What?

127
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,170
Your muscles are pretty fatigued.

128
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,320
Are they?

129
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,300
Do you ache when you move?

130
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,430
Wait, how can you tell?

131
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,890
That's my power.

132
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,250
Power?

133
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,100
Don't worry. You'll feel better in a sec.

134
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,110
Song Recovery Magic: Healing Lullaby.

135
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,610
This is...

136
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,120
She pinpointed each individual spot.
What precise magic use.

137
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,510
H-How do you feel?

138
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,120
Well, I feel...

139
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,880
This is awesome! I don't
hurt anywhere anymore!

140
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,840
My body feels so light!

141
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,950
My muscles aren't fatigued anymore!

142
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,720
Thank you, Kahono! You're amazing!

143
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,240
I've never seen song recovery magic before.

144
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,730
Great!

145
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,870
Okay, that'll be 100 yuls per session.

146
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,450
You're charging me?!

147
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,650
Just kidding!

148
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,020
Good...

149
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,630
Or not!

150
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,700
You're really charging me?!

151
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,070
Money's important, right?

152
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,450
Here...

153
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,330
One hundred.

154
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,520
Thank you kindly.

155
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,090
Just let me know when you
want me to sing for you again.

156
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,930
My hundred yuls...

157
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,210
That's just spare change.

158
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,650
How is that spare change?!

159
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,400
I can buy at least ten tatoes with that!

160
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,840
See? It is change.

161
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,090
Damned royalty!

162
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,670
You're both really funny.

163
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,090
How old are you?

164
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,160
Fifteen...

165
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,100
Same here.

166
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,260
Really? I'm fifteen, too!

167
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,100
We're the same!

168
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,680
Really?

169
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,940
Hey, let's be friends!

170
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,020
Sure, count me in. You're pretty funny.

171
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,720
A girl my age... who's a friend?

172
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,930
This is my first one.

173
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,930
W-Well, if you insist,
I guess I don't mind.

174
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,090
I'm willing to be your friend.

175
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,830
Yay!

176
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,830
Oh, sorry. I'm so happy, I couldn't help myself.

177
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,200
Really?

178
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,130
I see. So you're both Magic Knights.

179
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,330
That's amazing!

180
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,220
I-It's no big deal.

181
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,620
It's to be expected for me. I'm royalty.

182
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm a peasant, though.

183
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,690
So, what brings you to Raquey?
Taking a vacation?

184
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,130
We're on an important mission.

185
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,280
We're actually trying to get
to the Underwater Tem—

186
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,280
Stupidsta!

187
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,380
The Underwater Temple?

188
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,450
Sorry, but this mission's a secret.

189
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,320
Well, whatever.

190
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,660
So, what were you two up to at this hour?

191
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,670
Could it be... Eek!

192
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,420
Wh-What are you talking about? Of course not!

193
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,380
The moonlight is so romantic, isn't it?

194
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,830
The sound of the splashing waves
also heightens the mood and... Eek!

195
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,090
I told you, that's not it!

196
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,010
I was training, too! Magic training!

197
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,480
Magic training?

198
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,790
Y-Yeah. I can't give you the details,

199
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,020
but I need to learn how to control my magic
within the week before the next full moon.

200
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,900
Otherwise, this important mission—

201
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,210
I see.

202
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,110
So you want to control your magic...

203
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,010
Hey, Noelle. Show me your magic real quick.

204
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,050
Huh?

205
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,910
You can do it, Noelle!

206
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,110
Wow! That's amazing!

207
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,350
I see. Good work, Noelle.

208
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,580
Now that we're friends,
I have some advice for you.

209
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,380
Huh?

210
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,930
I think you're trying to hold in

211
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,860
your mana too much when
you try to control your magic.

212
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,110
Huh?

213
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,210
Listen closely.

214
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,590
Can you hear it?

215
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,650
I listen to the sound of
the waves to calm myself

216
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,630
so I can use my magic exactly how I want to.

217
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,630
Exactly how you want to?

218
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:08,600
It might just be me, but I think that true
concentration comes from a calm heart.

219
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,630
From a calm heart?

220
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,890
I get it!

221
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,240
I also feel like my best swings happen when
I'm not thinking about anything at all!

222
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,730
Would you shut up?

223
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,980
You don't even use magic, and you're
never thinking about anything, anyway.

224
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,240
What's the kindest memory you have
that brings you the most peace?

225
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,210
My kindest... memory?

226
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,740
Yeah. Maybe your family?

227
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,860
My family...

228
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,510
To think that the last thing the
one they called the Steel Princess

229
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,950
gave this world would be
someone as useless as you.

230
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,520
I'll never accept a failure
like you as family.

231
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,530
Solid...

232
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,300
Are you seriously Mother's child?

233
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,780
The House of Silva doesn't
need someone like you.

234
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,030
Nebra...

235
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,780
Um, Nozel...

236
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:18,250
Why did Mother have to die to
give birth to someone like you?

237
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,520
You killed our mother.

238
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,430
Thanks for the advice, Kahono.
I'll try practicing a bit more.

239
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,470
Let me know if you get tired.

240
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,250
It'll only be a hundred... No, it'll only
be a thousand yuls, since you're a royal.

241
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,850
A kind memory...

242
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,490
Sister, how are you doing?

243
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,660
You're shining under my sun!

244
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,730
Are you stupid?

245
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,880
Not yet!

246
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,500
Keep it up!

247
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,700
You're truly a goddess.
My little sister, Marie...

248
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,720
What the heck is that?

249
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,140
Are they having some kind of contest?

250
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,740
Not yet!

251
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,170
Thanks, Kahono.

252
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,990
You can just pay me later.

253
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,200
Of course.

254
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,060
Not yet...

255
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,500
I can't drink any more...

256
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,020
Not yet!

257
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,010
Noelle!

258
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,520
Everyone left me...
Won't someone come get me?

259
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,490
The full moon is tomorrow...
Tonight's my last chance.

260
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,910
Don't worry! You've almost got it, Noelle!

261
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,330
There's no time... I still
can't control it at all.

262
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,670
At this rate, the mission will be...

263
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,170
I just got a great idea!

264
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,550
Asta?!

265
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,300
Noelle! Stop thinking,
and set all of your magic free!

266
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,360
Huh?

267
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,890
I just remembered!

268
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,440
That thing from the first time you lost control
would probably go underwater the best.

269
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,520
Remember what Kahono said earlier?
That you were holding your magic back?

270
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,920
If that's the case, maybe it'll work
if you just let everything loose.

271
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,550
A-Are you crazy?

272
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,530
If it doesn't work—

273
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,700
I told you! If that happens,
I'll use my sword to save you!

274
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,450
So don't worry and just go!

275
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,960
Fine! Don't blame me if something happens!

276
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,710
I'm releasing...

277
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,210
all my magic!

278
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,720
Amazing!

279
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,730
I knew it! This isn't going to work at all!

280
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,330
How am I supposed to relax in this situation?

281
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,690
Noelle!

282
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,700
Noelle!

283
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,720
I guess I really can't do it.

284
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,800
I mean...

285
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,640
I don't have any... kind memories at all...

286
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,900
Noelle!

287
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,890
You can do it!

288
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,680
You're always talking big,
so what the hell is that?

289
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,560
And you call yourself a Black Bull?!

290
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,260
All that awesome magic is going to waste.

291
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,590
Hurry and learn how to control it
so you can fight me!

292
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,470
It'll be fine! Even if you mess up,
you won't die or anything!

293
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,820
Just take it easy!

294
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,970
You must be hungry!

295
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,570
Hurry up and finish so you can eat this!

296
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,200
Even if you fall, I'll catch you gently!

297
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,330
If you fall, I'm kicking you back
up there, so make this work.

298
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,330
Grey Disguised as Magna

299
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,330
Just get it done, damn it!

300
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,450
Noelle! You can do this!

301
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,130
I had some...

302
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,030
Some kind memories within me.

303
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,360
So you're Nozel's little sister.

304
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,850
Your big bro mentioned that you're some
loser who can't even control her magic.

305
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,130
And that you wouldn't be able to pass
the Entrance Exam even if you tried.

306
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,120
I've never seen a royal fail before.

307
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,870
If you'll excuse me...

308
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,130
Well, if you feel like fighting,
why don't you come join my team?

309
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,220
Huh?

310
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,430
The absolute worst Magic
Knights squad, the Black Bulls.

311
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,630
We're all nothing but losers.

312
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,050
Meaning we're perfect for you.

313
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:29,110
I was with my family for years, but I didn't
have a single pleasant memory of them.

314
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,400
It's only been a few months since
I joined the Black Bulls, but...

315
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,400
I have so many memories!

316
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,280
So many kind memories.

317
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,120
And...

318
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,340
They all acknowledged me
and gave me a mission.

319
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,590
I want to help them!

320
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,300
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!

321
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,060
I... I did it!

322
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,060
All right!

323
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,070
The Sea Dragon's Cradle...

324
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,040
I did it! I really did it!

325
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,770
Don't get distracted!

326
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,660
I'll protect the food!

327
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,330
This feels great after
being in the sun all day!

328
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,510
Hey, it's my turn!

329
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,550
I'll be right there!

330
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,550
Hup!

331
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,800
Asta! That was my job!

332
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,540
S-Stupidsta...

333
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,410
You did it, Noelle!

334
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,060
Huh?

335
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,690
Could you not touch me so casually?!

336
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,310
What?!

337
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,320
Who the hell are you?

338
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,040
Thank goodness everything ended well.

339
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,570
Now, let's drink up.

340
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,890
Kahono! I did it—

341
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,250
Huh? Kahono?

342
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,880
All right! Time to celebrate!

343
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,330
Yeah! Let's celebrate!

344
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,570
Here we go!

345
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,910
You did it, Noelle.
You surpassed your limits.

346
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,740
Well, guess we should get going

347
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,570
to the Underwater Temple.

348
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,300
You've got some great friends!

349
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,990
They're the ones who should be
cheering for you in the end!

350
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,770
Good for you!

351
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,340
Well, I'll be waiting for you, Noelle!

352
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,730
Inside the temple! Okay?

353
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,370
Petit Clover

354
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,410
Petit Clover!

355
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,870
Song Recovery Magic!

356
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,670
Song Recovery Magic!

357
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,680
Song recovery magic?! That's amazing!

358
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,590
Sing for me!

359
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,600
