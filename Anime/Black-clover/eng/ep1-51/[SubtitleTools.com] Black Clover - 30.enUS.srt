1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,650
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,170
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,610
He's so strong...

5
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,160
What the hell was that magic?

6
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,480
So, how would you like to die?

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,880
P-Please spare us! We'll never
attack the village again!

8
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,010
I won't kill you this time.

9
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,040
Huh?

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,670
Because today is...

11
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,590
Marie's birthday.

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Huh?

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,730
Come on. Celebrate Marie's birthday with me.

14
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,060
Who the heck is that?!

15
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,970
Rejoice greatly, rejoice
with all your might,

16
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,170
and then die.

17
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,620
I'm going to die anyway?!

18
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,800
The Mirror Mage

19
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,080
Village in the Boonies: Hage

20
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,750
Father!

21
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,000
They sent money again this month.

22
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,500
Great!

23
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,310
Are they doing well?

24
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,690
We'll be able to eat lots of tatoes again.

25
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,010
Yay!

26
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:32,020
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
1st Class Junior Magic Knight
2nd Class Junior Magic Knight
3rd Class Junior Magic Knight
4th Class Junior Magic Knight
5th Class Junior Magic Knight

27
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,220
Apparently Yuno became a
first-class junior Magic Knight.

28
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,020
That's awesome! It's only been
two months since he joined!

29
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,070
Yuno is the hope of Hage!

30
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,130
What about Asta?

31
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,100
I'm sure he's trying too hard
and being a burden to everyone.

32
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,280
Asta, you can come home at any time!

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,990
Let's see... "Hello, Sister Lily,
brats at the church, and Mayor."

34
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,540
What about me?!

35
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,290
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
1st Class Junior Magic Knight
2nd Class Junior Magic Knight
3rd Class Junior Magic Knight
4th Class Junior Magic Knight
5th Class Junior Magic Knight

36
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,290
Asta's also become a
third-class junior Magic Knight?!

37
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,170
What?!

38
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,420
I see... I guess Asta's working hard, too.

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,180
To think our Asta is finally...

40
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,510
Both of you stay healthy, and do your best!

41
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,520
The Golden Dawn's Headquarters

42
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,650
Yuno.

43
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,410
I heard you moved up to
first-class junior Magic Knight.

44
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,780
Congratulations.

45
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,900
It's no big deal.

46
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,030
Exactly.

47
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,470
We wouldn't want you to get too cocky.

48
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,030
I still far surpass you in
both rank and experience.

49
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,430
Klaus?

50
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,500
Take this.

51
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,510
A little gift from your senior
in honor of your promotion.

52
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,050
You sent all of your pay
back home, didn't you?

53
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,020
Klaus is so shy.

54
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,700
He was so happy when he heard
you had been promoted

55
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,770
that his glasses were sparkling with joy.

56
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,020
It's a bit smothering.

57
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,700
Black Bulls' Base

58
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,080
All right, all eyes up here.

59
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,080
We just got paid, so no work today.

60
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,710
Yeah!

61
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,710
All right! I'm gonna train real hard!

62
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,510
Thanks, Mr. Yami!

63
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,130
Awesome decision, sir!

64
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,910
Let's drink! The night's still young.

65
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,250
Time for second breakfast!

66
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,850
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

67
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,840
I'm gonna hit on all the girls!

68
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,450
Ocean girls? Mountain girls?

69
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,860
All the girls meet... me!

70
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,740
By the way, Gauche, good job
handling that many guys yesterday.

71
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,040
Today's my sister's birthday, so could I have
the next year off, until her next birthday?

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,980
No.

73
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,490
I'm so bored! I wonder if anyone
will attack the royal capital again.

74
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,680
Hey! Maybe I'll attack it!

75
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,130
That's a bigger no.

76
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,380
Your luck with money goes
up if you polish gold.

77
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,860
None of these guys intend to work at all...

78
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,230
Cotton Creation Magic: Sheep Cooks!

79
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,900
Time to eat!

80
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,980
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

81
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,980
You've got tatoes!

82
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,140
I procured the local specialty from my
meal-saving prince's hometown, Hage Village!

83
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,500
Dig in, everyone!

84
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,750
Thanks! So good!

85
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,780
It's so dry. Must be full of fiber.

86
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,010
It's so flaky.

87
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,470
It completely dried out my mouth.

88
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,610
So dry...

89
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,490
Munchy, munchy...

90
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,570
My love for my meal-saving prince
provides the best seasoning!

91
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,570
I wonder what I should get my
goddess Marie for her birthday.

92
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,760
All right! I'm gonna get all the cuties—

93
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,580
Hold it.

94
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,390
Oh, right...

95
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,970
You want to do some gambling, so you
want me to take you into town again?

96
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,420
No, before that...

97
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,170
Not sure if it's the fiber working,
but I'm about to hit my limit right now.

98
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,680
That is the one limit you may not hit!

99
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,340
Evil, begone!

100
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,770
Honestly...

101
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,370
How am I supposed to find anything to do
when we get a day off on such short notice?

102
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,850
Magna!

103
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,370
If you have some time,

104
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,610
I was wondering if you could drop me off
somewhere on your super-awesome broom!

105
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,360
I can't say no to my cute little underling.
Where do you wanna go?

106
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
To Nean!

107
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,870
I-Isn't that...

108
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,710
The place where those guys had the mixer?

109
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,420
And what are you gonna do there?

110
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,820
Well...

111
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,000
Well?

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
I'll tell you on the way!

113
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,660
What the heck?!

114
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,730
I-It's not like I care what he does.

115
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,760
A-And I have absolutely no interest
in who he's going to see!

116
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,930
Get on. Let's get going.

117
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,290
Huh? Right now?

118
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,010
Otherwise, we're not going.

119
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,050
Let's go!

120
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,330
Hold on tight!

121
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,220
O-Okay, so I do want to know!

122
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,750
City in the Common Realm: Nean

123
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,750
To my dear, beloved little sister Marie...

124
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,260
I just arrived in the city you live in.

125
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,410
My job as a Magic Knight is rough, but if
it's for you, it's not really rough at all.

126
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,520
I can even buy you presents with my pay.

127
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,610
A former convict like myself is
only able to live a proper life

128
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,590
for the sake of your angelic cuteness,
Marie. It's all thanks to you.

129
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,890
Ah, already, my nose won't stop bleeding.

130
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,790
Lord Gauche!

131
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,790
We've been waiting for you!

132
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,300
Come in! We've got plenty of birthday
presents for you to choose from!

133
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,200
Hurry up and show me around.

134
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,820
Right away!

135
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,610
First up, we have these!

136
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,150
All little girls love plushies,
and plushies love little girls!

137
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,810
I'm sure her delight will
show in her angelic smile.

138
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,320
Thank you, Brother!

139
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,060
I-I'll take them all...

140
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,070
Thank you, sir!

141
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,470
Next, we have this.

142
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,790
I'm sure the little darling will enjoy
her days playing house as she fantasizes

143
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,530
about living in a mansion like
this with her beloved brother.

144
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,590
Brother!

145
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,090
Welcome home!

146
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,850
I'll take that, too.

147
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,930
Thank you, sir!

148
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,810
Lastly, we have this! With this outfit,
your little sister can be a real angel!

149
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,860
Brother...

150
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,940
I love you!

151
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,570
Give me everything in the shop.

152
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,980
Thank you, sir!

153
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,830
What?! You're going to see a
chick you met at the mixer?!

154
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,290
Yup! I promised Rebecca that I would
play with her little siblings.

155
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,460
M-Man, you're already meeting
her family? Way to go!

156
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,800
Don't mess this up.

157
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,520
Got it!

158
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,060
There it is!

159
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,370
All right! I'm going to play
with all the strength I've got!

160
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,770
Don't get too crazy!

161
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,530
To my dear, beloved little sister Marie...

162
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,570
Please forgive your brother for
being late due to his anemia.

163
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,210
I bought you lots of birthday
presents. Please be happy!

164
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,300
I used up all of my pay, but no
price is too high for Marie.

165
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,590
I will be able to see my
little angel Marie soon...

166
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,340
I'll be able to see her smile...
Oh, my beloved Marie.

167
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,100
Marie... Marie... Ma—

168
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,600
How do you like that, Marie?

169
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,170
This is fun! You're so strong, Asta!

170
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,730
Me, too!

171
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,820
And me!

172
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,220
All right! Are you read—

173
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,000
Huh? What?

174
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,570
Get away from her this instant, you trash!

175
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,870
Hey, you're my senior with the sister complex
who's always getting nosebleeds!

176
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,370
Don't call me a guy with a sister complex
and nosebleeds, meathead runt!

177
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,710
I'll stomp you to death!

178
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,630
I train hard, so you'll have
to try harder than that!

179
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,180
He's so annoying.

180
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,140
I'm only able to see my sister,
who lives at the church, once a month!

181
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,250
Today is the one day that I get
to release my pent-up feelings,

182
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,570
worship the heck out of my sister,
and do all kinds of things with her,

183
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,570
so why are you worshiping her first, huh?!

184
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,400
See? You do have a sister
complex and a nosebleed!

185
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,910
So wait, she's your sister?

186
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,930
Don't you dare point at my angel.

187
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,110
I showed you her picture before!

188
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,460
Did you?

189
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,610
I was just visiting Rebecca,
and she just happened to be here.

190
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,710
Hi...

191
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,850
That guy is scary.

192
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,130
What does he mean by "all kinds of things"?

193
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,140
Shh!

194
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,470
Man, Marie sure is cute.

195
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,230
Of course she is! More importantly, why
do you have your eye on my little sister?

196
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,440
Stop!

197
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,030
Please don't be so mean, Brother!

198
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,730
I'm going to marry him!

199
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,980
I'm going to marry him... I'm going to
marry him... I'm going to marry him....

200
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,380
Marry him?!

201
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,000
I ended up following him because I was
curious, but what the heck's going on?!

202
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,000
Um... May I ask for the fare now?

203
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,570
Will this do?

204
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,460
That's too much!

205
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,760
I'll kill you... I'll kill you... I'll kill you...

206
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,760
Huh? What was that?

207
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,340
I'll kill you... I'll kill you... I'll kill you...

208
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,850
I'll kill you!

209
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,210
Mirror Magic:

210
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,710
Reflect Ray!

211
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,820
Wh-What the heck's up with that spell?!

212
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,740
I'll kill you!

213
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,030
Brother, stop!

214
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,740
It sure is noisy out here.

215
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,210
Marie, it's time. We must
go back to the church.

216
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,480
Sister!

217
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,330
Tch.

218
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,410
Oh, so you came, Gauche.

219
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,500
You old hag!

220
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,470
It's not "old hag," it's "Sister."

221
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,660
Marie's about to go on a date with me.

222
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,680
Go back to the church by
yourself, Sister Old Hag.

223
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,040
Not happening. It's time.

224
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,480
You go home, you sister complex punk.

225
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,980
In any case, it's not good for Marie
to spend time with a guy like you.

226
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,990
Your attitude's always terrible. You have
mean eyes and a filthy mouth.

227
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,810
What did you say, you shitty old hag?

228
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,770
See? Filthy.

229
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,990
Shut up. Die.

230
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,060
You've got some nerve,
saying that to an old lady

231
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,180
who's not long for this world, you fool.

232
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,580
Yeah, right, dumbass.
Says the old she-demon who'll

233
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,040
probably live another hundred years.

234
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,170
Don't talk to people like
they're monsters, you thug!

235
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,960
Shut up, gangster hag!

236
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,110
Gauche!

237
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,530
How can you talk to your elders like that?!

238
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,650
You shouldn't!

239
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,350
You stay out of this!

240
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,120
Anyway, go on home.

241
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,450
Let's go, Marie.

242
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,580
Brother, Asta! See you later!

243
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,280
M-Marie!

244
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,110
See ya!

245
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,740
See you later!

246
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,950
You okay, sister complex guy?

247
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,500
M-Ma... Ma... Ma...

248
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,500
What a weirdo.

249
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,370
Why don't you come in and have dinner at
our place while you wait for him to wake up?

250
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,820
You're welcome to spend
the night... if you want.

251
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,060
Really?!

252
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,860
Yeah!

253
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,880
Yeah, come over!

254
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,470
S-S-Spend the night?!

255
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,310
He's going to spend the night at the home
of a girl he just met?! Is he stupid?!

256
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,970
How stupid can he be?!

257
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,580
And Asta is so funny!

258
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,400
That really loud boy?

259
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,550
Yeah!

260
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,280
S...

261
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,780
So good!

262
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,350
Isn't it?

263
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,300
This is so good!

264
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,050
Would you like some moguro fruit?

265
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,620
So fast!

266
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,130
All these dishes are so good
that I can't put my spoon down!

267
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,410
Really? I'm glad to hear it!

268
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,710
You'll be a great wife one day, Rebecca!

269
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,310
It's no big deal...

270
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,640
What are you talking about?! There's more to
being a good wife than just being a good cook!

271
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,690
Sissy, are you going to marry Asta?

272
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,450
N-No, Marco!

273
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,010
Of course she's not!

274
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,960
You should totally jump him tonight, Sis!

275
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,120
You idiot! What are you saying, Luca?!

276
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,920
Goo goo.

277
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,140
Y-You too, Pem?! Do you even
know what you're saying?!

278
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,650
J-Jump him? No, you dummy, dummy, dummy!

279
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,160
What's going on? What is this?

280
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,660
It's not even winter! Why is it so cold?

281
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,160
Huh?

282
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,700
You should totally jump him tonight!

283
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,720
Goo goo.

284
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,960
Y-You too, Pem?!

285
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,390
You dummy! Dummy, dummy, dummy!

286
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,210
I-I would never do anything like that!

287
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:40,430
I-I'm just going to check and see if
Luca and Marco are actually asleep...

288
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,540
Asta...

289
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,570
Die, Asta.

290
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,900
Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray.

291
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,590
Hot!

292
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,740
G-Gauche?!

293
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,970
Die, Asta.

294
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,140
Why? Wait, what? What's going on?

295
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,190
Huh? What?!

296
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,980
I won't allow you to marry Marie. I'll make
sure it doesn't happen by killing you.

297
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,480
What?!

298
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,320
Kids say stuff like that all the time!

299
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,990
Only cowards attack people in their sleep!

300
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,030
I don't care if it's cowardly or not,
as long as I can kill you.

301
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,250
Mirror Magic:

302
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,950
Real Double.

303
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,270
Now there are two Gauches?!

304
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,590
First he shoots beams out of a mirror,
and now this? What's up with his magic?

305
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,590
Your crime...

306
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,430
is the fact that you met my little sister.

307
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,680
Wouldn't that make most people criminals?!

308
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,180
Shut up. Die.

309
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,270
That's not even your house!

310
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,520
S-Snow? When did it pile up so much?

311
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,080
It's not even the season for that yet.

312
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,390
I don't care about that. Just die.

313
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,210
Hey! What do you two think you're doing?!

314
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,090
Rebecca! I'm so sorry!

315
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,200
Now's not the time for that!

316
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,300
The kids are gone!

317
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,670
Huh?

318
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,550
Urian, where are you?

319
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,060
Chris!

320
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,890
Hey!

321
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,060
Von is gone!

322
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,330
Starting today,

323
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,570
you're all my friends.

324
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:57,350
Petit Clover

325
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,660
Petit Clover!

326
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,850
Double Gauche

327
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,330
Double Gauche.

328
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,980
Brother!

329
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,550
Spin me around like Asta did!

330
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,740
I'll... kill him!!

331
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,740
Spin... Marie around?!

332
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,740
Brother?!

333
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,700
I can't disappoint Marie...
I'll have to rely on my clone...

334
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,500
Mirror Magic: Real Double!

335
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,690
Spin her around...

336
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,210
I can't put Marie in danger.

337
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,760
That's true!

338
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,880
Then I'll just have to do it for her.

339
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,910
See? We're spinning!

340
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,050
You're not doing it right.

341
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,970
What? The ABCs of cooking?

342
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,770
All will Bow down before my Cooking!

343
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,980
Black Clover, Page 31:
"Pursuit Over the Snow."

344
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:54,250
Page 31
Pursuit Over the Snow

345
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,740
But now's not the time for that!
The kids are in trouble!
