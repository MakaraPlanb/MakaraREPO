1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,200
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,510
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,870
The Eye of the Midnight Sun
is led by a man named Licht,

5
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,530
who owns a four-leaf grimoire.

6
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,680
They are a terrorist group he formed
six years ago, and they hold

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,800
a grudge against the Clover Kingdom.

8
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,320
They have about fifty mages who are members.

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,200
Among them are their leader, Licht,

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,010
as well as the three they call the
Third Eye: Raia, Vetto, and Fana.

11
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,030
They are much stronger
than the other members.

12
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,470
They all hold a strong grudge
against the Clover Kingdom,

13
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,050
and they use that to justify
their terrorist attacks.

14
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,960
Their endgame is to have an
independent country of their own.

15
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,300
That about covers everything, doesn't it?

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,200
Yes.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,680
And this is the most important
bit of information...

18
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,300
I've learned that there
is a traitor among you

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,560
who is working with the
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

20
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,230
What?! Among the c-c-captains?!

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,900
I knew it.

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
Who could it be?

23
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,410
Because of you, Captain Fuegoleon was...

24
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,920
Why?! Why would you betray us?!

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,850
Three-Leaf Salute

26
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,150
Now, would you kindly tell me

27
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,930
which one of these captains is the traitor
who aided the Eye of the Midnight Sun?

28
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,520
Tell me their name.

29
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,160
It's...

30
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,740
The captain of the Purple Orcas,

31
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,010
Gueldre Poizot.

32
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,280
Impossible! What are you talking about?

33
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,560
Th-They're terrorists that
attacked our beloved nation!

34
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,700
You'd actually believe what they're saying?

35
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,170
As if I would ever betray the Clover Kingdom!

36
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,090
I'd rather not say this,

37
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,650
but I've heard a few dark rumors about you.

38
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,430
It's not just a few. We've heard many.

39
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,390
Wh-What? Really?

40
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,540
Come to think of it, I've heard
plenty of rumors like that.

41
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,210
Apparently, they weren't all false.

42
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,650
I knew you were probably up to
something sketchy, but this is just...

43
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,280
Don't be ridiculous! Th-This
must be some kind of mistake!

44
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,790
I know! They're trying
to frame me as a traitor!

45
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,960
They're only telling me what
they know, plain and simple.

46
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,780
Information obtained with
my memory exchange magic

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,670
is absolute.

48
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,260
You heard him, Hard Ham.

49
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,970
I'm not hard!

50
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,120
Just calm down.

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,390
Why not just let the guy with the
bowl cut look at your memories?

52
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,400
If you're really a clean ham, that is.

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,490
I agree with everything other
than what you called me.

54
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,490
If you're truly innocent, you should.

55
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,780
W-Well, I...

56
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,040
What? Are you embarrassed?

57
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,730
You a teenage boy or something?

58
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,490
You're behaving shamefully, Gueldre.

59
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,620
You will pay for betraying
the kingdom with your death.

60
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,300
So it really is you.

61
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,420
Because of you, Captain Fuegoleon was...

62
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,420
No! This is some sort of trap!

63
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,090
I'll clear my name!
This is a strategic retreat!

64
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,520
Transparency Creation Magic:
Invisible Great Mage!

65
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,270
He disappeared?

66
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,390
He's actually trying to get away?

67
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,530
Well, this just got real.

68
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,570
This isn't good. His transparency magic

69
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,200
makes him vanish for a set amount of time,
and all spells will go right through him.

70
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,500
Meaning while he's invisible,
our attacks won't do a thing.

71
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,210
What?! But that makes him invincible!

72
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,590
Transparency Creation Magic:
Invisible Troops.

73
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,340
Hold them back for me!

74
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,100
We can't just let him get away!

75
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,880
Dorothy, this is no time to be sleeping!

76
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,200
What are we going to do? We can't
catch him if we can't see him.

77
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,410
Yami.

78
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,460
There's nothing to worry about.

79
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,350
I'm not going to get caught
by the likes of you!

80
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,410
My magic is invincible!

81
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,510
I used this power to claw my way up to
the position of Magic Knights Captain!

82
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,800
Then I accumulated a fortune through
business and became a wealthy merchant.

83
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,340
I am a great mage who has
both wealth and power!

84
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,480
I won't let it end here!

85
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,760
I will rise again and again with this
magic and my business talent!

86
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,910
You're right there!

87
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,250
Wh-What?!

88
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,240
Y-You shouldn't have been able to see me!

89
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,760
How?! How were you able to attack me?!

90
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:35,210
Hard Ham is able to hide his
magical powers, but not his ki.

91
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,270
And since the anti-magic sword
isn't magical, it'll work against him.

92
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:47,020
Looks like an anti-magic kid who can read
ki ended up being his natural enemy.

93
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,830
Don't mock me! I'm a captain!

94
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,410
You magicless peasant!

95
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,970
You look better when you're
groveling on the ground!

96
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,130
Not yet!

97
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,300
I'm not letting you get away!

98
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,030
The Magic Knights Captains
that I admire so much

99
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,230
wouldn't run away over something like this!

100
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,480
Very well. If you want to die that badly...

101
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,110
I shall grant your wish for you!

102
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,480
Mr. Poizot.

103
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,070
Hold still a sec.

104
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,140
Picture Magic: Spring of Restriction.

105
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:09,080
Ah, yes, Mr. Poizot, you're
a picture-perfect fellow.

106
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,110
I think I'll call this...

107
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
The Drowning Captain.

108
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,360
What do you think?

109
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,900
What is this magic?

110
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,120
Rill, how dare you go easy on him?

111
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,710
Well, I mean, if I hadn't done that,

112
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,120
this building would've been destroyed.

113
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,780
His magic allows all magic
to pass through him.

114
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,920
In that case, we can simply
attack using physical objects.

115
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,430
We'll just have some commoners
rebuild the building.

116
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,430
I lost the chance to let loose on a captain.

117
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,440
The guy resembles a ham exactly,
so he would've been perfect to slice up.

118
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,970
We're Magic Knight Captains.
We can't just sit around and space out.

119
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,180
We have to at least strike a pose.

120
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,700
Are you still asleep?!

121
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,930
Actually, you still managed to keep up...

122
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,180
You sure are reliable for
someone who's always asleep!

123
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,340
Running away, even though
you're a man. How pathetic.

124
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,090
Even if you weren't a traitor,
you'd still be a failure as a captain.

125
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,230
Wh-Why is Yami only paying
attention to Dorothy?

126
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,590
Does he like women like her?

127
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,600
Friends, I believe that's enough.

128
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,850
Someone may be controlling him with magic.

129
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,480
Wow, I'm glad I said that
when everyone was here.

130
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
I can't tone down my magic, after all.

131
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,170
These people are insane!

132
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,990
These are the best Magic Knights...
the best in the country?!

133
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,990
Hey! You were amazing earlier!

134
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,560
How did you know where Mr. Poizot was?

135
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,620
How'd you undo his transparency magic?!

136
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,410
U-Um...

137
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,130
Well, whatever. I'm Rill,
and I'm nineteen! Who are you?

138
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,290
I-I'm Asta, and I'm fifteen.
Wait, you're nineteen and a captain?!

139
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,090
Ah, so you're younger than me!
Hey, Asta, be my friend!

140
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,890
Wait, with a captain? Uh...

141
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,100
Well, sure! Okay!

142
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,380
Yay! Just between you and me,

143
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,100
everyone here's way older than me, so it's
been rough having to tiptoe around them!

144
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,200
I see! And they're all weirdos, too!

145
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,440
Hey, you jerks. I can hear you.

146
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,450
Also, you're the weirdos here.

147
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,870
Now, then...

148
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,950
I have some questions for you,

149
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,870
Gueldre.

150
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,880
Gueldre, everything you've
said so far is true?

151
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,340
Yes.

152
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,680
Man, that's quite the list.

153
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,960
Abusing his own squad members,

154
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,480
embezzling funds, selling national
treasure-class magic items

155
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,750
on the black market...

156
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,670
And smuggling dangerous magic
potions from other countries.

157
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,070
He's already pitch-black
before even being a traitor.

158
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,330
He might be a good fit for the Black Bulls.

159
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,670
Actually, becoming a burnt-black
ham sounds better for him.

160
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,700
What are you even going on about?

161
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,080
So this is why he didn't want
his memory read with magic.

162
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,870
Most important of all...
Kidnapping barrier mages.

163
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,210
That's direct cooperation with
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

164
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,080
That's solid proof of how they managed
to infiltrate the royal capital.

165
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,140
He was dazzled by rare magic items and
made a deal with those terrorists.

166
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,390
What a fool.

167
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,230
Well, unfortunately,
he's always been like that.

168
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,730
The Eye of the Midnight Sun has probably
killed the kidnapped barrier mages already.

169
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,490
This is an unparalleled blunder.

170
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,760
He was a Magic Knight,
charged with protecting our citizens,

171
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,990
yet he sold them out instead.

172
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,930
In order to keep the citizens
from growing uneasy,

173
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,370
we won't make this a public matter.

174
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,670
But to ensure that this never happens again,

175
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,160
check all of your squad members to make
sure no one has ties to the enemy.

176
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,340
Yes, sir!

177
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,470
Well, well...

178
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,370
I'm a pretty decent actor.

179
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,110
No one can see through my
copy transformation magic.

180
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,570
So which one of them was actually me?

181
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,490
Now nobody's going to be
suspicious for a while.

182
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,170
I'm sorry for making you two stay behind.

183
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,150
It's sad... being betrayed by
comrades who fought alongside me.

184
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,650
I sprinted at full speed to get where I am,

185
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,910
but as a result, I may have
made a lot of mistakes.

186
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,180
If that's the reason you had us stay behind,

187
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,020
you picked the wrong guys, Julius.

188
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,940
To tell you the truth,
when we were interrogating

189
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,760
the two Eye of the Midnight Sun members,

190
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,990
they told us one more thing.

191
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,780
Asta, do you remember the stone
tablet back at their hideout

192
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,160
when you were taken by them?

193
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,740
That thing...

194
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,170
They call the stones that were
set into it "magic stones."

195
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,670
They believe that if they
collect all of them,

196
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,750
they will be reborn into their true forms,

197
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,970
which are linked closely to mana,
and gain enormous power.

198
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,170
Apparently they also went after Fuegoleon

199
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,470
because they wanted the
magic stone that he had.

200
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,360
Reborn, eh?

201
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,480
You sure they didn't just read
one too many fantasy novels?

202
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,310
We don't know whether that's true or not,
but their obsession with it is real.

203
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,120
We must not let them get the stones.

204
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,830
Oh, and?

205
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,870
There are three magic stones left.

206
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,820
They know the location of one of them.

207
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,870
Yeah? And where's that?

208
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,130
In a strong magic region...

209
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,540
The Underwater Temple.

210
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,950
A... strong magic region?

211
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,880
What's that?

212
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm pretty sure you don't
need this head anymore.

213
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,180
Stop! I won't say any more! Please spare me!

214
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,660
Perfect. Let me crush it for you.

215
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,780
Strong magic regions are, as the name
suggests, regions with strong magic,

216
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,140
where all sorts of magical phenomena
occur to prevent people from entering.

217
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,230
Of all the regions with strong magic,
the Underwater Temple

218
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,750
is said to be especially dangerous.

219
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,020
The dungeon you recently
conquered could be considered

220
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,240
a beginner's course in comparison.

221
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,790
There's a place that's even
more amazing than that?

222
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,080
So you want us to get there before
the Eye of the Midnight Sun does

223
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,290
and snatch the magic stone or whatever?

224
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,410
That's right.

225
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,540
This is an important mission.
The best squad for the job

226
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,570
is the one with lots of members who aren't
restricted by familial or social status...

227
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,800
Which means your Black Bulls, Yami.

228
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,270
There may still be traitors
among the Magic Knights.

229
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,670
Will you do it?

230
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,270
You're the Wizard King. If that's
what you think, just give the order.

231
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,430
As a captain, you're definitely right that
I don't have anything holding me back.

232
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,760
I hear he's not from this kingdom.

233
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,030
Apparently he's a castaway from some foreign
country who lives on the coast by himself.

234
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,290
He looks kinda dangerous.

235
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,530
I wish he'd just leave the country.

236
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,610
You can't be serious! Why does a
foreigner like him get a grimoire?

237
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,470
I bet his magic's worthless.

238
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,520
Let's get rid of him with our magic later.

239
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,310
What's that magic?

240
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,950
Scary...

241
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,310
How creepy.

242
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:06,890
Yeah... Just because I got a grimoire, that
doesn't change the fact that I'm a foreigner.

243
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,610
I don't have anything tying me down,
but that also means I'll always be alone.

244
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,230
Or so I thought...

245
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,340
Wow! That's dark magic, isn't it?!

246
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,730
That's amazing! I've never seen that before!

247
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,390
Hey, hey, hey! Let me
get a better look at it!

248
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
No. Who the heck are you, old man?

249
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,520
Old...? Oh, but I'm not suspicious at all!

250
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,260
I'm just a Magic Knights Captain who
was wandering around in disguise.

251
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,890
What's a Magic Knight?

252
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,830
Huh? You don't know?!

253
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,450
Hmm...

254
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,620
Well, why not come see for yourself?

255
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,340
I'm sure you've got potential.

256
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,140
Nope.

257
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,860
Oh, come on! Don't be like that!

258
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,660
Nope.

259
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,880
I'll treat you to dinner.

260
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,830
Okay, I'll go.

261
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,710
I see. I guess that's not enough...

262
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,290
Wait. You'll come?

263
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,030
I'll go if you buy me dinner.
I'll definitely go.

264
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,670
You sure are interesting!

265
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,970
I guess I've been stuck with you ever since.

266
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,690
I'm just going to use my power
to prove it, that's all.

267
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,950
To prove that you've made no mistakes.

268
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,080
Yami's actually saluting.

269
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,230
I'm counting on you, Yami.

270
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,780
And you, Asta...

271
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,130
Y-Yes, sir!

272
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,270
It's a strange coincidence
that you joined Yami's squad.

273
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,800
Strong magic regions have
strong mana force fields

274
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,140
around them that prevent
outsiders from getting in.

275
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,600
I doubt anyone would be able to
get in without your anti-magic.

276
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,280
And your experience fighting
with the Eye of the Midnight Sun

277
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,650
is bound to be very useful.

278
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,610
I'm counting on you.

279
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,430
Yes, sir!

280
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,390
I got too excited and
knocked the air out of myself!

281
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,550
I've never seen someone
self-destruct from saluting.

282
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,170
I can definitely tell that you chose him,
considering how interesting he is.

283
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,270
You were stiff as a board back there.

284
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,690
I guess clowns can get nervous, too.

285
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,420
Who are you calling a clown, sir?

286
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:24,160
It's just... I've never had someone who I
thought was amazing, like the Wizard King,

287
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,680
expect anything from me before.

288
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,190
Joining the Magic Knights when
you can't even use magic?

289
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,190
There's no way!

290
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,670
Actually, no one's ever really expected
anything from me to begin with.

291
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Ouch!

292
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,810
I let you join the Black Bulls
because I thought you could do it.

293
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,830
Work your butt off.

294
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,410
Yes, sir!

295
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,010
All right!

296
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,220
The beach!

297
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,580
Men bring to mind the beach!
The beach brings to mind men!

298
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,640
I'm getting all excited for no good reason!

299
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,140
Yeah! Come to think of it, I've
never even seen the ocean before!

300
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,890
I haven't either, Shrimpsta!

301
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:37,110
Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach!

302
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:15,170
There's nothing better than enjoying
a cold one under the blazing sun!

303
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,560
Shake, shake, let's shake!

304
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,220
I'll make some original drinks and flirt
with some hotties in swimsuits on the beach!

305
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,200
S-Swimsuits?!

306
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,860
Does that mean...

307
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,550
If I go to the beach, I-I-I-I'll
have to wear a swimsuit, too?!

308
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,490
Mr. Shrimp, Mr. Crab, and all the
many other varieties of seafood,

309
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,110
I can't wait to grill you
all up on the beach...

310
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,800
I hope we all get to put sunscreen
on each other at the beach.

311
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,670
Captain!

312
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,100
Captain, what should I get for Marie?

313
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,650
Hey, sharks are strong, right?

314
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,520
I hope the sharks eat you both.

315
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,510
S-Swimsuit... Swimsuit...

316
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,440
If you don't have one,
you can borrow one of mine.

317
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,270
Beach! Beach! Bea—

318
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,280
Shut up!

319
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,830
We're not going for leisure!
We're going for work!

320
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,620
Yes, sir...

321
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,150
The Underwater Temple, huh?

322
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,290
I wonder what it's like...

323
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,430
Petit Clover

324
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,970
Petit Clover!

325
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,940
Game Tournament

326
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,410
Game Tournament.

327
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,190
This is so cool!

328
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:07,030
To think your magic can let us play games
like this... You're amazing, Mr. Bowlcut!

329
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,150
This is called memory amusement magic,

330
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,510
and it allows you to battle with characters

331
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,200
you've created from your memory.

332
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,450
And my name is Marx—

333
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,080
Whoa! The captain was super
strong when he was young!

334
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,250
How nostalgic. It's Yami
when I first met him.

335
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,590
You're no match for me, kid.

336
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,600
Not yet! I'm not done yet!

337
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,420
Go right! Right! Counterattack!

338
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,350
Now left!

339
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,470
You bastard...

340
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,680
Why don't we have a real battle
instead of one in a game?

341
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,680
I'll die!

342
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,950
It'll seriously be game over!

343
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,540
Wh-What should I do? If we're going
to the beach, I'll need a swimsuit.

344
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,270
