1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,940
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,390
Th-There's an emergency!

5
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,120
Th-The capital!

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,250
The capital is under attack!

7
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,300
The Clover Kingdom fell under attack
while the Wizard King was absent.

8
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,890
The royal capital was in flames,
and people fled from the dead.

9
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,530
You're stronger than me, right? Right?!

10
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,540
Get out here, Magic Knights!

11
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,620
I get it! There are people
out there who need our help!

12
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,310
I'm gonna go!

13
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,330
Asta!

14
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,940
Where do you plan to go?

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,380
We don't even know the full situation yet,
and you can't sense magic at all!

16
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,130
I'm going to where it's noisiest!

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,260
D-Do you think you're
an animal or something?!

18
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,610
Interesting!

19
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,890
Let's see what you've got!

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,480
Wait for me, Asta, my rival!

21
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,980
I'm sure you'd rather not take orders
from me, but listen well, Magic Knights!

22
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,630
I'll go after Leo and that Black Bulls boy,

23
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,570
and after I've joined them,
we'll head to the north district.

24
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,140
Silver Eagles, I ask that you
head to the central district,

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,070
where the magic is strongest.

26
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,520
Blue Roses, head to the east district!

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,870
I'd rather not take orders from a man,
but I suppose I don't have a choice.

28
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,750
Golden Dawn, split into two teams and head
to the west and northwest districts!

29
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,100
Let us go.

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,010
I guess we'll just have
to save dessert for later.

31
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,480
If we fail to protect the royal capital,
we'll bring shame upon the Magic Knights!

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,260
Do not let the enemy escape, no matter what!

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,760
Right!

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,570
Little girl... Do you
like the Clover Kingdom?

35
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,970
I-I love it!

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,860
So please... stop this.

37
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,330
Well, I hate it!

38
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,880
So the town... the people...

39
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
And you, too, little girl...

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,260
I'll destroy you all!

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,970
The members of the Magic Knights moved out,

42
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,350
and when Asta arrived...

43
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,430
Then I'll protect them!

44
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,750
I would always close my eyes

45
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,090
And cower at reality

46
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,770
I can't stand the idea

47
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,140
Of just making excuses to give up

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,240
Stand right there

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,400
I don't want to be near you

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,540
Any minute now

51
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,940
Just wait right there

52
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,940
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

53
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,020
Black and blue

54
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,940
I'll give up on giving up

55
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,450
And get the world on my side

56
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

57
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,330
Every time somewhere under this sky

58
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,180
Break through the tearful nights

59
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,470
And head where the light shines

60
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,300
I want to keep my promise

61
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,850
I'll deliver it to you

62
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,820
shape of love

63
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,590
Wild Magic Dance

64
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,780
Wh-What's going on?

65
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,550
North District

66
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,850
Someone finally shows up,
and it's a Black Bull.

67
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,270
And a little kid to boot.

68
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,440
Get away from her, you crazy bastard!

69
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:09,390
You fool! You won't be able to stop
my army with that rusty sword!

70
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,460
What...?

71
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,620
I was so scared!

72
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,790
You really acted fast!

73
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,870
It's dangerous, so stand back.

74
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,840
Okay!

75
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,680
Ah, I see. You're the one
with the anti-magic.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,280
You've heard of me?

77
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,730
Man, gimme a break!

78
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,670
No one asked the bottom-ranked Black Bulls

79
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,020
or a piece of trash like you with no magic

80
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,270
to show up here!

81
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,780
Do it!

82
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,370
Central District

83
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,410
Don't think you're going to get away with...

84
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,820
What? What do you want?

85
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,250
I'll give it to you, just—

86
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,390
It's the Silver Eagles!

87
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,390
Captain of the Silver Eagles
Nozel Silva

88
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,770
Member of the Silver Eagles
Solid Silva

89
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,770
The Magic Knights have come to save us!

90
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,560
The captain is here! We're saved!

91
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,250
Member of the Silver Eagles
Nebra Silva

92
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,320
Lord Nozel! Lord Solid!

93
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,900
Lady Nebra!

94
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,650
Citizens, fall behind us.

95
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,660
West District

96
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,720
What are these things?

97
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,690
Every time we knock them down,
they get up again!

98
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:49,930
I was planning to have dessert when we
got back, but I think I've lost my appetite.

99
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,930
East District

100
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,000
Whoa, these things are gross, Sis!

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,310
Indeed. I feel nauseous just looking at them.

102
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,310
Also, be mindful of your tone.

103
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,820
Oh, I'll be more careful!

104
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,710
Stay away from me!

105
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,330
Northwest District

106
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,550
There are so many!

107
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,950
Not a chance...

108
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,920
Do they have some kind of weakness?

109
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,300
It matters not. There's no point
in wasting time trying to find it.

110
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,300
North District

111
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,070
They're disgusting...

112
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,810
Is my rival safe?

113
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,540
We can look for the
Black Bulls boy later, Leo.

114
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:46,440
These things possess magic,
but they aren't alive.

115
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,850
In that case...

116
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,950
We'll just have to crush them
until they can't get back up!

117
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,320
See if you can take my magic!

118
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,340
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

119
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,210
Flame Magic: Sol Linea!

120
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,630
A-Amazing...

121
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,640
Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

122
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,780
Goodness, you fight in such a vulgar manner.

123
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,530
You should at least

124
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,730
die in elegance and beauty!

125
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,280
Glass Creation Magic: Verre Fleur!

126
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,980
Shatter before my magic!

127
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,120
Sand Creation Magic:
Sand-Armored Heavy Guard!

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,150
Wind Magic: Towering Tornado!

129
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,550
If you're hurt, please come see me!

130
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,560
I will heal you with my
Dream-Healing Flower Cradle.

131
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,930
Filthy creatures, stay away from me.

132
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,810
Quit grossing my Sis out!

133
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,450
Earth Creation Magic: Raging Mother Goddess!

134
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,300
Call me "Captain."

135
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,060
I will not allow anyone to touch me.

136
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,450
Briar Creation Magic:
Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees!

137
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,520
You're all eyesores!

138
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,970
Water Creation Magic: Slashing Sea Serpent!

139
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,990
Mist Magic: Solid Mist Clones!

140
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,340
Oh, dear. They weren't much fun.

141
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,410
Accept your punishment.

142
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,990
Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver.

143
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,330
Punishment for the crime of
daring to threaten the people

144
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,210
of this country.

145
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,170
Flame Creation Magic: Leo Rugiens!

146
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,430
Burn to ashes!

147
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,140
Th-They're amazing!

148
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,180
The Magic Knights!

149
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,570
They're so powerful!

150
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,090
They're too amazing!

151
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,340
How'd you like that?

152
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,370
That voice!

153
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,580
He...

154
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,120
Don't tell me he managed to mow down
that many of them with just a sword!

155
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,320
He's so strong!

156
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,460
What a stupidly straightforward
way of fighting!

157
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,730
He's just too interesting!

158
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,820
This is why he's my perfect rival!

159
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,010
My magic runs my own mana through corpses,

160
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,020
making them move in any way
I want. It's wraith magic.

161
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:23,450
That guy's attacks instantly cut through
the mana in the corpses and erases it!

162
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,270
I guess that's all of them.

163
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,620
Th-Thank you, mister.

164
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,590
It's too early to thank me.

165
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,880
Why are you attacking
innocent people, you jerk?!

166
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,180
I'm going to defeat you, no matter what!

167
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,940
Number Four, Jimmy...

168
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,450
"Innocent"?

169
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,780
Everyone who doesn't understand my magic...

170
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,610
is a sinner!

171
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,300
Why are you attacking
innocent people, you jerk?!

172
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,600
I'm going to defeat you, no matter what!

173
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,370
Number Four, Jimmy...

174
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,870
"Innocent"?

175
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,210
Everyone who doesn't understand my magic...

176
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,050
is a sinner!

177
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,250
They keep coming, one after another...

178
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,230
But they're no match for me.

179
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,150
Just a few more...

180
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,780
You're okay now.

181
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,580
One after another...

182
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,500
Are you all right?

183
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,550
Goodness, you saved me.
I'll treat you to some gelato later.

184
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,970
Take that, and that, and that, and that!

185
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,270
Every rose has its thorns.

186
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,650
Mist Spider's Threads.

187
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,520
Water Creation Magic: Holy Water Bullet!

188
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,370
That brat's your prey this time, Jimmy!

189
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,540
Hey! You just keep bringing out these
creepy things one after another!

190
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,250
No fair, you jerk!

191
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,050
My wound opened up even more?

192
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,820
Jimmy got you with one of his
specially made curse shells.

193
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,890
It's loaded with curse power.

194
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,290
Even scratches won't stop bleeding.

195
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,490
I'd be real careful if I were you.

196
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,450
Jimmy!

197
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,440
I won't be able to swing
my big sword fast enough!

198
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,600
You sure are a pain for a brat
that doesn't have any magic.

199
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,200
But Jimmy's still got
lots of curse power left.

200
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,330
Oh, but before we deal with you...

201
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,260
Jimmy, finish off that eyesore
of a brat back there first!

202
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,850
Who are you aiming at?!

203
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,900
Oh, right. I guess you Magic Knights
protect the people.

204
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,200
Just abandon her already!

205
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,580
Uh-oh. There's no point in getting hurt
just to protect others, is there?

206
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,040
Mister...

207
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:47,750
What do you gain from protecting a little
brat like that, you hypocritical loser?!

208
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,380
I'll protect her, even if I
don't gain anything from it!

209
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,170
Will you? I see. Then stay right there

210
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,690
and swing your sword around until
you bleed to death, you moron!

211
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,820
Asta!

212
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,200
I have to help him.

213
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,660
You can't even control your magic.
You're such an embarrassment.

214
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,810
You've basically been exiled
from the Silva family.

215
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,260
I'm surprised you had the nerve
to return to the Noble Realm.

216
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,760
You do not belong here.

217
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,140
Begone,

218
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,730
failure that killed our mother.

219
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,110
I-I can't... Someone...

220
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,690
Someone... Please, someone help Asta...

221
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,830
Thank y—

222
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,830
Focus!

223
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,830
Ow! What was that for?!

224
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,740
Black Bulls girl,

225
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,470
you're not letting what your
siblings said get to you, are you?

226
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,260
There's no time for that on the battlefield!

227
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,550
One wrong decision and a life could be lost!

228
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,730
You're standing here right now
as a member of the Magic Knights!

229
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,930
If you joined the Magic Knights
of your own free will,

230
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,670
then steel yourself and get stronger!

231
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,200
Steel myself?

232
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,870
Being weak is nothing to be ashamed of.

233
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,870
However, staying weak is!

234
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,050
He's right...

235
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,100
He's the one who proved that to me!

236
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,310
If he can do it, I can also...

237
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,100
become stronger!

238
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,780
Mister!

239
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,190
The weak will always die weak!

240
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,500
Crap!

241
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,460
I won't make it in time!

242
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,710
Who the hell are you?

243
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,840
Noelle!

244
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,100
What are you doing, Stupidsta?

245
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,460
I can't bear to just sit and watch this.

246
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,440
I'll help you, so you'd better be grateful!

247
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,270
Got it!

248
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,470
There's no way he can stop
you if you can move freely.

249
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,580
Go!

250
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,440
Looks like you're back to normal.

251
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,860
I was never feeling down!

252
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,910
You stupid brats!

253
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,870
Don't get so full of yourselves!

254
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,660
I shall assist you, my rival!

255
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,220
Get that bastard good!
Show me your true power!

256
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,140
Uh... Thank you very much!

257
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,850
There's no need to thank me!

258
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,550
And I was going to do that anyway!

259
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,120
Not yet! I'm not done yet!

260
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,120
Whoops...

261
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,340
You did it!

262
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,960
Mister!

263
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,420
You don't fight like any other mage!
You're just too interesting!

264
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,620
Huh?

265
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,690
Don't let that ridiculous
attack get to you, Jimmy!

266
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,660
Hey, Jimmy!

267
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,240
Stop blabbering.

268
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,240
Come at me yourself!

269
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,940
Wha? Don't get cocky, you little brat!

270
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,100
Come forth, Alfred.

271
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,760
Number Two, Alfred.

272
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,710
Go, Alfred!

273
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,580
Asta...

274
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

275
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,570
And push me forward

276
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,610
(I can't find a place to go)

277
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

278
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,390
And change the flow of time

279
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,810
(I will keep believing in you)

280
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,690
In this ever-vivid place

281
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,630
(Break free yourself)

282
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

283
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,190
If there is a path that I should choose

284
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

285
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,160
Wherever it may lead us

286
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,650
Until my life comes to an end

287
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

288
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

289
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

290
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

291
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

292
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,340
Petit Clover

293
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,340
Petit Clover!

294
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,840
Ra

295
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,500
Ra!

296
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,170
Hello.

297
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,410
Hello.

298
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,180
I'm Asta. Nice to meet you.

299
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,110
So, you haven't actually said
your name in the show yet.

300
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,190
Could you tell us what it is?

301
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,940
Yes, my name is Rades.

302
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,940
(Hai, ore no namae wa Radesu desu.)

303
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,450
Radesdes? I see.

304
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,700
So where did you come from, Radesdes?

305
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,940
No, it's not Radesdes.
You don't need the "des."

306
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,840
We don't need the des?
So your name is just Ra?

307
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,970
Who're you calling Ra?

308
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,520
Well, you said there was no "des."

309
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,500
It's Rades! I just mean
you don't need the "des."

310
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,460
It's Radesdes, but you don't need the "des"...

311
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,150
So if you take out all the "des,"

312
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,100
It's just Ra?

313
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,510
I'm telling you that's not right!
I'm Rades! Rades!

314
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:37,990
You better remember that, you useless brats!

315
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,020
The Magic Knights are no match for me!

316
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,770
I, Rades, am the strongest of them all!

317
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,860
Black Clover, Page 23:
"The Crimson Lion King."

318
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:55,000
Page 23
The Crimson Lion King

319
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,740
Controlling corpses is my magic!
