1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,450
The Eye of the Midnight Sun considers
the Clover Kingdom their enemy.

5
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,930
Their goal is to defeat the Clover Kingdom
and create their own independent nation.

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,640
They believe that once they
gather all the magic stones,

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,860
they will transform into their true
forms and inherit great power.

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,280
But in order for them to
attain their true forms,

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,530
they need three more magic stones.

10
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,460
It was discovered that one of those
stones lies in the Underwater Temple,

11
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,890
within a strong magic region.

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,540
I'm counting on you, Yami.

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,750
And you, Asta...

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,620
A Black Beach Story

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,790
We were able to complete our
mission yet again today.

16
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,540
I'm sure our great Captain
Vangeance will praise us.

17
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,610
Yes.

18
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,590
But Yuno...

19
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,390
Yes?

20
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,400
Sylph, was it? Your spirit
magic is indeed powerful.

21
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,440
But you need to stop fighting on your own.

22
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,490
We are a team!

23
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,660
Yuno is ignoring him brilliantly.

24
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:11,240
Got it? Next time, don't ignore my orders
and defeat all of the enemies instantly!

25
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,880
We will do things according to my plan!

26
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,360
Are you listening to me, Yuno?

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,750
I am.

28
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,050
Excellent.

29
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,420
That scream...

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,860
I think it came from over there.

31
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,180
I wonder if there's an incident.

32
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,260
Let's go!

33
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,920
Give it up!

34
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,240
No, wait!

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,100
That voice...

36
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,940
A robbery?!

37
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,690
Noelle?

38
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,650
What's going on?

39
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,560
Th-That's my line!

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,870
Swimsuits?

41
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,400
Yes, little Golden Dawn boy.

42
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,200
Little boy?

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,180
We're going to the ocean tomorrow.

44
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,200
Noelle doesn't have a swimsuit,
so I was helping her pick one out.

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,690
I even told her she could borrow one
of mine, but she doesn't want to.

46
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,340
It was just strings!

47
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,180
How could I possibly wear that?

48
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,950
I-I see.

49
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,180
Then that scream earlier...

50
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,970
That's because Vanessa
suddenly took off my clothes!

51
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,680
Well, it makes no sense to try on
swimsuits while still wearing clothes.

52
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,190
It's your own fault for
taking forever to undress.

53
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,260
Right?

54
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,320
Not a chance.

55
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,200
What about this one, Noelle?

56
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,140
I told you, there's no way I could wear that!

57
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,580
All this fuss over nothing.

58
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,900
Picking out swimsuits to go to the beach?

59
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,880
Are you lot just fooling
around instead of working again?

60
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,160
How rude! This is for a mission.

61
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,310
A mission?

62
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,570
Yes.

63
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,720
An s-e-c-r-e-t one...

64
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,430
Want to come along, little boy?

65
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,390
How adorable.

66
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,850
We don't have any spare time
on our hands, so I'll pass.

67
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:02,860
I'd love to go to the beach, but we
also have another mission tomorrow.

68
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,110
I see. That's too bad.

69
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,740
I-It's my Meal-Saving Prince!

70
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,350
I would've loved to see you
in a swimsuit, Noelle.

71
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,070
Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?!

72
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,000
I wonder what he'll say if
he sees me in my swimsuit...

73
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll send you pics later.

74
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,500
Glance...

75
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,170
She's so sexy! She looks...

76
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,970
so delicious!

77
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,730
I-I'm flattered!

78
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,470
Devour me—

79
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,180
Hurgh!

80
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,220
Owie...

81
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,020
Huh? Where's my Meal-Saving Prince?

82
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,010
The Golden Dawn kids already left.

83
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,900
La...

84
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,370
I guess you've already
picked out your swimsuit.

85
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,860
Now we just need you to hurry
up and pick one, Noelle.

86
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,570
What about this one?

87
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,410
I told you, I can't wear that one!

88
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,450
Then how about this one over here?

89
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,750
Over where?

90
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,540
It's a little expensive, though.

91
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,740
The price doesn't matter.
It's pretty and cute.

92
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,580
But... it doesn't seem to cover very much.

93
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,390
Also, what's all that flashy decoration for?

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,470
All eyes will be on you at the beach.

95
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,020
Eyes...

96
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,980
I wonder if Stupidsta will notice me.

97
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,790
Maybe he'll at least
compliment me if I wear this...

98
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,860
Like I care if he notices me or not!

99
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,650
Um... What would you like to do?

100
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,280
I'll buy it, okay?!

101
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,920
Keep the change.

102
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,860
What?!

103
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,750
Are you ready, you bastards?!

104
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,420
My goddess Marie... I wanted
to take you to the beach.

105
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,340
I wonder if whales are stronger than sharks.

106
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,260
Sharks have very rough skin.
Did you know that?

107
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,020
Why are you two on my Crazy Cyclone,
totally expecting a ride from me?!

108
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,690
Well... I can't fly on a broom, so...

109
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,560
The same goes for me. Did you already forget?

110
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,570
How stupid are you?

111
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,120
Who do you think you are?!

112
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,660
Why don't you guys ride
on someone else's broom?!

113
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,560
You have royalty like me
offering to ride with you.

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,200
You should be thankful, you peasant.

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,460
Seriously, who do you think you are?!

116
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,170
Is Captain Yami still asleep?

117
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,680
He said he wanted to check
something out and left earlier.

118
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,590
Really? It's pretty unusual for
him to actually do some work.

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,180
That's Mr. Yami for you!

120
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,930
All right! Let's go!

121
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,940
Crazy Cyclone, blast off!

122
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,530
The place where Asta and the others are
headed is an oceanfront town called Raquey.

123
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,510
Raquey has very strong mana,
causing it to be hot year-round.

124
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,000
This makes it a popular resort getaway
for royalty, nobles, and Magic Knights.

125
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,250
Why didn't you just use your spatial
magic to get there, Finral?

126
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,070
I've never been to Raquey before.

127
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,760
I can't use my spatial magic to go
to places I haven't been to before.

128
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,710
Tch. You're so useless!

129
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,890
Now we have to fly over.

130
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,140
Seriously, I have seniority over you!

131
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,210
I'm surprised you've never
been there before, Finral.

132
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,040
I figured you were flirting with
all the girls on the beach there.

133
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,680
It's always better to save
the best things for last.

134
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,990
That's why I haven't gone yet.

135
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,240
I'm so excited to go to Raquey!
Wait for me, girls!

136
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,290
Hey, wait. The guy who's always
awkwardly exhaling steam isn't here.

137
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,290
Huh?

138
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,530
I'm right here!

139
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,840
So wait, that was Grey?

140
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,140
Then where's the real Gordon?!

141
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,230
Huh? Guys? Are you still asleep?

142
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,310
Isn't it time to leave soon?

143
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,940
Wait... Did they already leave?

144
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,680
We should be able to see it soon.

145
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,200
See what?

146
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,340
The ocean.

147
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,040
I can't wait! I've never seen it before!

148
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,290
Me, neither!

149
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,130
But I still don't see any sign of it.
Is Raquey still pretty far away?

150
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,840
No, it shouldn't be.

151
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,500
What are you talking about?

152
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,800
We've been looking at the
ocean for quite some time now.

153
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,410
Don't tell me...

154
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,270
Seriously?

155
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,150
It's so huge, I couldn't even tell!

156
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,520
It's beyond my wildest dreams!

157
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,770
So this is the ocean?!

158
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,440
This is amazing!

159
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,410
The ocean... It's so huge!

160
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,080
Awesome... This is so cool!

161
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,250
I wish I could show Yuno and
the other runts this view, too.

162
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,610
What about me?!

163
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,810
And someday, I'd love to
bring Sister Lily here, too.

164
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,550
Seriously, what about me?!

165
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,260
The sunset's so beautiful, Asta.

166
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,550
Yes... But Sister Lily...

167
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,270
You're even more beautiful.

168
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,310
Huh?

169
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,470
I became the Wizard King.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,650
So, Sister...

171
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,450
Whoosh! Open!

172
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,280
Marry me.

173
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,170
Of course!

174
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,040
Just kidding!

175
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,250
What's he smirking about?

176
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,840
He'd better not be remembering that k-k-kiss!

177
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,290
W-Wipe that smirk off your face!

178
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,140
I-I-It's not like I'd ever
kiss him or anything.

179
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,510
I'm going to show off this swimsuit
I bought yesterday in front of him!

180
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,920
D-Don't get the wrong idea!

181
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,030
I'm just going to show him that
I'm way better than Rebecca.

182
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,660
I'm so embarrassed!

183
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,530
But I want him to see me...
But this is still really embarrassing!

184
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,370
But...

185
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,630
Hey, Stupidsta! Wh-What do you
think about this swimsuit?

186
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,000
How do you like my awesome swimwear?!

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,060
Whoa! What the heck is that, Magna?!

188
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,520
Isn't it awesome?! This is something that
Mr. Yami also uses! It's called a loincloth!

189
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Dork.

190
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,960
Let's swim to our hearts' content in this
ocean that's as big as Mr. Yami's heart, Asta!

191
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,030
You got it, Magna!

192
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,530
Hey, you two.

193
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,330
What do you think of my swimsuit?
Doesn't it look great on me?

194
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,430
It's not that different from
how you usually dress.

195
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,350
Yeah.

196
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,880
I guess a virgin delinquent like you
can't understand adult charm.

197
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,140
Who are you calling a virgin delinquent?!

198
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,090
Wanna go for a run?

199
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,690
Man, you're on fire, Magna!

200
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,500
Shut up, you blasted fools!

201
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,230
What do you think, Marie?
I made it look just like you.

202
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,530
Yeah, thanks!

203
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,900
Hey, Brother, show me the ocean!

204
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Of course. With pleasure.

205
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,530
Look, Marie. This is the ocean.

206
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,030
That's amazing! It's so big and beautiful!

207
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,200
Next time, we can come here
together and splash around!

208
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,080
Hey, it's pretty cold...

209
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,840
Hey, it's Asta! I want to play
with Asta in the ocean someday!

210
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,210
H-Hey... What do you think?

211
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,890
I'm giving you permission to
look at me in my swimsuit.

212
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,300
Anyone who tries to tempt my Marie shall die!

213
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,640
Hey, Asta!

214
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,310
Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray!

215
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,990
Tch.

216
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,510
It's so salty!

217
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,610
Wait, huh?! I can't breathe!

218
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,860
Seriously, look at me already!

219
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,580
I can't swim!

220
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,030
There!

221
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,080
So, so many hot girls in swimsuits!

222
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,620
All right! Let's go flirting!

223
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,290
Grey! Transform into me!

224
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,960
Yeah! Check it out, yo!

225
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,500
Okay, Grey! We'll be twins, and our selling
point can be our snappy dialogue!

226
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,320
What time is it?

227
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,300
Leave it to me!

228
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,730
This goes hand-in-hand with the beach.

229
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,480
If it's food, I know it
like the back of my hand.

230
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,770
So good!

231
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,050
Nothing beats having drinks on the beach!

232
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,420
Charmy, you need to move more to the right!

233
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,280
Huh?

234
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,250
Weren't you helping Finral
pick up some girls?

235
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,950
Yeah, but I got bored, so I left him behind.

236
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,160
A little more to the left!

237
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,430
I told you, to the right!

238
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,700
The left!

239
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,940
I can tell... Just a little more...

240
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,300
Just... ten more steps!

241
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,070
I thought I was a goner!

242
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,230
Hey, Asta, my swimsuit...

243
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,560
You're right there!

244
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,220
Ouch!

245
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,670
What are you doing, Miz Charmy?!

246
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,370
If you had hit anyone else, they'd be dead!

247
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,730
Hey, watermelon juice.

248
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,640
You don't get it at all!

249
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,530
Hey! My swimsuit!

250
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,230
Hey, Asta. It only occurred to me after I
turned into you, but your muscles are gross.

251
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,540
You should use your transformation
spell for something more useful, Grey!

252
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,600
You're wasting it!

253
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,210
My swimsuit!

254
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,710
Oh, yeah...

255
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,050
Now what?!

256
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,790
It's just like I thought! Running on this
sand is excellent training for my legs!

257
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,910
Look at me in my swimsuit, you idiot!

258
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,230
You still can't control your magic?!

259
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,400
You saved my butt this time, but seriously!

260
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,400
Aw, it went out.

261
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,570
Hmph. All I can manage without a staff are
defense spells that remain stationary.

262
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,570
Why are you bragging about that?!

263
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,250
Ding!

264
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,790
Bah-ha!

265
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,130
So this is the famous Raquey Beach.

266
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,800
The ocean is calling my name!

267
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,280
Sekke, should we really be playing around?

268
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,350
Isn't that all we really do?

269
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,430
Well, I did such a good
job on that last mission...

270
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,680
that the Wizard King gave me a hundred stars!

271
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,960
Bah-ha!

272
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,890
Captain Jack praised me, too!

273
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,490
And most importantly, I saved all
the kids from those evildoers.

274
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,050
It wouldn't hurt for me
to spread my wings a bit.

275
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,740
Hey, beautiful ladies.

276
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,170
Bah-ha?

277
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,970
Where are you from?

278
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,920
Home.

279
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,300
Ah, I see. Want to come play with me?

280
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,540
Nope.

281
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,340
Huh?

282
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,960
W-W-W-W-Wait!

283
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,620
Wait a sec!

284
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,300
Look at that loser trying to pick up girls.

285
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,500
Go on, you two. Go pick up some girls.

286
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,260
Huh? What about you, Sekke?

287
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,710
You stupid bah-hastard!
I can't do something so vulgar.

288
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,020
I'll meet up with you guys after you
successfully pick up some girls.

289
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:50,480
This jerk! He's planning to show up
and act like he's doing us a favor!

290
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,640
The only reason you got to come here is
because of me, the Magic Knight, right?

291
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,620
I gave you a chance. Now, go on.

292
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,760
Oh, jeez...

293
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,160
Guess we don't have a choice.

294
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,880
Look, there are some ideal
babes right over there.

295
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,700
Bah-ha! Don't worry about me! Let's go!

296
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,220
You go...

297
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,140
Hey there, cuties!

298
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,020
Wanna come talk with us about
how awesome magical girls are?

299
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,010
Get lost, insects.

300
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,110
Bah-ha...

301
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,550
She's from the Black Bulls!

302
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,820
Wait, does that also mean...

303
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,080
Take this, damn it! Explosive Scattershot!

304
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,570
Watermelon!

305
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,160
Hup! Hup!

306
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,080
Die! Reflect Ray!

307
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,540
Bah-ha!

308
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,880
Bah-ha!

309
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,500
Oh, dear...

310
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,430
Did we just run something over?

311
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,230
Who knows?

312
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,000
I think we ran into something.

313
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,770
Nyom, nyom, nyom...

314
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,100
Wait! Hey! We came here to
look for the magic stone!

315
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Why are you all playing around?!

316
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,600
And you're not?

317
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,480
C-Captain Yami...

318
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,170
All right, gather round, you idiots.

319
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,740
I picked up some info while
you were messing around.

320
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,940
Huh?

321
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,080
Apparently the Underwater Temple
really is at the bottom of the ocean.

322
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,190
But the mana kicks up the
ocean currents so much that,

323
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,540
ordinarily, even a first-class
mage can't get near it.

324
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,370
But on the night of the full moon,

325
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,050
the mana becomes weaker.
We might be able to get in then.

326
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,220
C-Captain Yami is actually,
seriously doing his job!

327
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,600
I'm seriously going to murder all of you.

328
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,770
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

329
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,920
Like the name suggests, the Underwater
Temple is on the ocean floor.

330
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,000
We can't just walk to it.

331
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,920
So Noelle...

332
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,140
Take us there with your water magic.

333
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,050
Huh?

334
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,910
Give us a ride there.

335
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,660
B-But I'd need incredible magic
control in order to do that.

336
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,540
I can't! You should ask someone else.

337
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,550
I-I mean, if I fail...

338
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,630
You're right.

339
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,800
If you fail, the fierce currents will
take us all under, and we'll drown.

340
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,600
This is a top secret mission
entrusted to only the Black Bulls.

341
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,720
No one else can do it.

342
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,100
You do it.

343
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,100
The next full moon is a week away.

344
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,360
Learn to control it by then.

345
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,610
Surpass your limits.

346
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,970
Sea Dragon's Lair... Right now,
it's my only spell.

347
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,250
Developing it further should
be the quickest way.

348
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,210
But...

349
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:09,810
Vanessa taught me some magic control
tricks before, but none of them have worked.

350
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,440
Maybe I just don't have the
ability to control magic.

351
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,340
But even if I don't have talent,
I won't run or make excuses!

352
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,120
I'll just keep working...
until I figure it out!

353
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,890
This time for sure...

354
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,170
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

355
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,480
So you were training too, Asta?

356
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,590
And you too, Noelle?

357
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,930
A-As if a royal like me would train.

358
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,600
Let's train together, then.

359
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,590
Huh?

360
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,750
If you lose control again,
I'll be able to stop you.

361
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,060
H-Hmph! That won't happen again.

362
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,570
Training with just the two of us...

363
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:05,370
W-Well, if you insist,
I guess I wouldn't mind...

364
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,820
Um, Asta?

365
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,950
I hear something.

366
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:00,270
Petit Clover

367
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,330
Petit Clover!

368
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,770
Look at Me!

369
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,580
Look at Me!

370
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,450
Hey, Stupidsta. Look at me!

371
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,280
How do I look in this swimsuit?

372
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,040
You're all sparkly.

373
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,780
Isn't it heavy?

374
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,130
That'd probably work great
as part of a scarecrow.

375
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,010
You sort of look like a cow back in Hage...

376
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,800
Wh-What are you staring at?!

377
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,240
Crab!

378
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,800
Crab!

379
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,450
But you told me to look!

380
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,930
Ugh, I'm so embarrassed...

381
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,450
Crab...

382
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,920
Bah-ha! Did you all enjoy yet another
appearance by me, the great Sekke Bronzazza?

383
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,650
I'm even more bah-hawesome on the beach!

384
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,700
Black Clover, Page 41:
"The Water Girl Grows Up."

385
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,250
Page 41
The Water Girl Grows Up

386
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,700
One, two, three, bah-ha!
