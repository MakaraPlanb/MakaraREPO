1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,730
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,600
Asta and Yuno arrived at the royal
capital of the Clover Kingdom.

5
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,680
Everyone in the kingdom dreams
of becoming a Magic Knight.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,670
The Magic Knights Entrance Exam
was about to begin.

7
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,460
The Magic Knights Entrance Exam

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,730
Grey words can't make anything happen

9
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,430
I know, yeah I know

10
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,650
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

11
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,690
I dreamed it all my life

12
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,480
Step by step I go, though
it's a doubtful world 

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,540
Don't care how much I fall

14
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,010
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

15
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,330
To faraway future, I burst out running

16
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,790
Go beyond even the unseen fears

17
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,880
The vision I had, so I can be myself

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,140
Someday I will write the next page

19
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,640
You are my hope

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,390
Like that page from someday

21
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,730
I was able to meet you

22
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,690
I call this a miracle

23
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,300
The Clover Kingdom

24
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,080
Castle Town Kikka

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,630
Whoa, this is awesome!

26
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,470
Awesome!

27
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,730
They're fresh!

28
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,220
One sec. It's almost done roasting.

29
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,980
That looks so good!

30
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,230
Wow! They have so many different
kinds of staves and items!

31
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,810
But they're so expensive!

32
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,940
It's so different from our village.

33
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,870
Is that where the Wizard King is?

34
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,550
And probably the king, too.

35
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,170
So that means that'll be my castle someday.

36
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,920
You mean mine.

37
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,670
Don't worry. I'll let you live there, too.

38
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,210
That's my line.

39
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,860
There, there. Don't cry. Let's hurry
back and get ready to open up the shop.

40
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,270
Reminds me of everyone back at the church.

41
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm sure Sister and the others
are lonely now that I'm gone.

42
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,020
Not a chance.

43
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,290
Hey, Yuno!

44
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,330
Hey!

45
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,710
Ah, it's so nice and quiet.
What a relief to have Asta gone.

46
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,690
Oh, there you go again.

47
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,250
I-I really mean it!

48
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,950
They've probably reached
the royal capital by now.

49
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,380
I hope the Magic Knights Exam goes well.

50
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,610
Me, too.

51
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,010
Huh?

52
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,900
N-Nothing!

53
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,230
Asta, Yuno...

54
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,030
Do your best.

55
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,980
So where do they hold the
Entrance Exam, anyway?

56
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,370
Probably over there.

57
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,950
What is that?

58
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,180
Grilled purple snake. It was super cheap.

59
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,810
Anyone want some grilled purple snakes

60
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,830
that I just happened to
catch somewhere or other?

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,380
Want some?

62
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,410
No.

63
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,310
It's super nutritious and will
give you lots of energy!

64
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,890
Not a chance. Let's go. This way.

65
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,890
Do your best on the exam!

66
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,170
You are the Clover Kingdom's hope!

67
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,800
The future of the kingdom is in your hands!

68
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,680
Stay focused!

69
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,310
I'll do my best!

70
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,330
You don't know him...
You don't know him...

71
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,300
You're #163. All right, next.

72
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,300
I'm Yuno from Hage Village.

73
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,550
Yuno from Hage...
Could I see your grimoire?

74
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,390
A f-four-leaf clover...

75
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,980
So that's who everyone's talking about.

76
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,720
Hey, that grimoire...

77
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,380
Is it really a four-leaf clover?!

78
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,810
Wow...

79
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,820
You're #164. All right, next.

80
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,820
I'm Asta, also from Hage Village!
Here's my grimoire!

81
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,440
This is pretty filthy.

82
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,080
Is this really a grimoire?

83
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,860
Huh? Of course it is! Take a good look!

84
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,830
See? See?

85
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,140
All right, all right...

86
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,130
You're #165.

87
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,890
Got it!

88
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,010
All right!

89
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,030
Bah-ha! He must be a real go-getter if he
came here all the way from the boonies.

90
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,070
Man, I'm getting really nervous.

91
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,030
Hey, ow! What the heck are these birds?!

92
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,180
The infamous anti-birds of the exam venue.

93
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,360
Really? These things?

94
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,450
The weaker your magical powers,
the more these guys flock to you.

95
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,110
Little pests...

96
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,210
Hey, look at that guy.

97
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,420
None of the birds are going to him.

98
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,740
Hey! It's the guy from earlier.

99
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,330
From earlier?

100
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,510
He's from some remote village called Hage,
yet he's got a four-leaf grimoire!

101
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,550
Wha... A four-leaf? Seriously?

102
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,020
One of us is going to become the Wizard King.
Our legend's beginning now, Yuno!

103
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,540
Wha...

104
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,030
Become the Wizard King?

105
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,530
I'm gonna show you just how much
I've grown in six months...

106
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,820
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

107
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,370
What the heck are these birds?!

108
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,580
What's with that kid?

109
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,780
Talk about a loser!

110
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,290
That's pretty bad, even for
someone from the boonies.

111
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,680
Get away from me, you stupid birds!

112
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,430
They finally flew off somewhere.
Hey, sorry for bumping into you.

113
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,310
I'll kill you, brat.

114
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,220
What the heck's his problem?!

115
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,520
Oh, crap. He's got the eyes of a killer.

116
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,230
His neck's so thick! No mage looks like that!

117
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,020
Talk about an intimidating presence!
Is he really my age?!

118
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,020
No, wait, wait... You shouldn't
judge a book by its cover!

119
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,780
Be friendly. Just be friendly.

120
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,730
Man, you look old!
You must've had a hard life!

121
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,430
It appears you're ready to die.

122
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,590
His looks weren't a lie at all!

123
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,590
Oh, there he is!
What are you doing down here?

124
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,750
I'm about to end this little twerp's life.

125
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,090
H-Hey... Isn't that...

126
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,130
Is that the great Finral Roulacase?

127
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,600
The user of rare spatial magic?

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,970
Hey, you're cute.

129
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,570
He's famous for being so girl-crazy
that it gets in the way of his duties!

130
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:35,490
And that's... Gordon Agrippa!
The expert on incantation magic!

131
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,870
I heard that he's impossible
to talk to... and also scary.

132
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,710
Whoa, cut it out! A Magic Knights Squad
Captain shouldn't kill an exam candidate.

133
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,070
Why did you even come down here, anyway?

134
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,310
I went to take a dump and got lost.

135
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,470
Squad Captain? You mean he's...

136
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,340
The Lord of Destruction, Yami Sukehiro?!

137
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,780
Ten... Nine... Eight...

138
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,780
What're you counting down to?!

139
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,380
The end of your life.

140
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,850
Yami?! The Captain of the Black Bulls?

141
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,030
The Black Bulls...

142
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,060
The cost they incur in damages exceeds
the successes they're credited for, right?

143
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,780
Apparently, there isn't a single
decent Magic Knight on that squad.

144
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,730
A playboy and a guy who
can't communicate... I see.

145
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,910
Yeah, I wouldn't want to join that squad.

146
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,180
I picked the wrong guy to mess with!

147
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,670
My head's seriously going to explode!

148
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,170
One...

149
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,770
Come on, the exam is about to start!

150
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,690
Guess you get to live a little longer, brat.

151
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,600
Better take good care of
the life you just got back.

152
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Or I'll kill you.

153
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,550
What?!

154
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,530
Bye!

155
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,330
I wish the captain would kill me, too.

156
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,960
Man, that sucked.

157
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,830
Bah-ha! You okay?

158
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,880
Y-Yeah...

159
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,780
Must've been rough, having Captain Yami
of the Black Bulls in your face like that.

160
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,050
Oh, I'm Sekke. Sekke Bronzazza.

161
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,890
Nice to meet you. Bah-ha!

162
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,190
I'm Asta! Nice to meet you!

163
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,040
Captain of the Silver Eagles
Nozel Silva

164
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,260
That's the Captain of the
Silver Eagles, Nozel Silva!

165
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,070
That's...

166
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,340
...one of the captains of
the Magic Knights Squads.

167
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,590
That's some hairstyle! Isn't it hard
to see with that thing in his face?

168
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:09,250
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings
Fuegoleon Vermillion

169
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,250
The Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,
Fuegoleon Vermillion.

170
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,780
As the name "Crimson" suggests,

171
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,350
he's a user of flame creation magic.

172
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,400
Whoa...

173
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,440
Captain of the Green Praying Mantises
Jack the Ripper

174
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,440
The Captain of the Green Praying Mantises,
Jack the Ripper.

175
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,580
What's a praying mantis?

176
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,160
You know, a mantis. Like, the bug.

177
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,300
Apparently, Captain Jack's severing
magic can split the earth in two.

178
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,910
Whoa, that's awesome.

179
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,420
But I don't want to be a mantis.
Bugs are super lame.

180
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:40,670
Captain of the Blue Rose Knights
Charlotte Roselei

181
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,670
The Captain of the Blue Rose Knights,
Charlotte Roselei.

182
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,660
She's so beautiful.

183
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,850
Yeah, but Sister Lily's prettier.

184
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,850
Captain of the Purple Orcas
Gueldre Poizot

185
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,850
The Captain of the Purple Orcas,
Gueldre Poizot.

186
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,530
That's all?

187
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,100
I have no interest in seamy guys like him.

188
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,280
Captain of the Coral Peacocks
Dorothy Unsworth

189
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,790
The Captain of the Coral Peacocks,
Dorothy Unsworth.

190
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,280
Is she walking in her sleep?!

191
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,830
Apparently, all she does is sleep.

192
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,870
Then how'd she become a captain?

193
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,990
She probably has an amazing power
you'd never expect her to possess.

194
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:16,170
Captain of the Aqua Deer
Rill Boismortier

195
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,710
The Captain of the Aqua Deer,
Rill Boismortier.

196
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,170
Isn't he pretty young?

197
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,360
Captain Rill is nineteen, I heard.

198
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,930
Nineteen?! He's only four
years older than me?

199
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,820
The path to becoming the Wizard King
might be shorter than I thought!

200
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,040
Bah-ha! Wizard King, eh?
That's a pretty big dream.

201
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,020
But for the next Wizard King...

202
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,900
They say he's the most promising candidate.

203
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,230
The Captain of the most powerful
Magic Knights Squad, the Golden Dawn,

204
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:51,290
Captain of the Golden Dawn
William Vangeance

205
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,450
William Vangeance.

206
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,540
The members of his squad
have utmost faith in him,

207
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,060
and it's said that in the last battle,

208
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,010
it was Captain William who
took the enemy general's head.

209
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,040
If only I could get into the Golden Dawn...

210
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
The Silver Eagles would be great, too!

211
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,770
You idiot. Only royal and noble elites make
it into the Golden Dawn and Silver Eagles.

212
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,670
Captain of the Black Bulls
Yami Sukehiro

213
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,650
Pain in the ass... Can't we
just get this over with?

214
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,600
This is an important exam that will
decide the futures of these youths.

215
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,240
We need you to take
this a bit more seriously.

216
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,950
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Serious.

217
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,030
The captains are all gathered in one place.

218
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,790
Wow...

219
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,570
It is said that each of the Magic Knights

220
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,630
Captains has the strength
of a hundred mages.

221
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,720
One of these individuals will
become the next Wizard King.

222
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,590
Where's the Wizard King?

223
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,010
Bah-ha! The Wizard King wouldn't
bother coming down to the exam.

224
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,600
It's a miracle in itself that all the
captains have gathered in one place.

225
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,730
Candidates.

226
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,780
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I will be conducting this exam.

227
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,950
Magic tree, descend!

228
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,550
That's still amazing.

229
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,940
So this is the man who's
closest to the Wizard King.

230
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,060
We will now begin the Magic
Knights Entrance Exam.

231
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,740
We will now have you all take several tests.

232
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,920
The nine of us will evaluate
your performance,

233
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,220
and then we will select the candidates
that we would like to add to our squads.

234
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,960
If chosen, you will join that squad.

235
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,100
If you're chosen by more than one squad,

236
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,910
you may choose the squad
you would like to join.

237
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,000
On the other hand, those who
are not chosen by any captain

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,990
are not qualified to join the Magic Knights.

239
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,950
I'm gonna get into the Magic
Knights, no matter what!

240
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,580
For the first exam, we will have
you get on those brooms and fly.

241
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,140
But that's...

242
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,410
I've never done that before.

243
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,190
Mages who can control their magical powers
should be able to this instinctively.

244
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,800
It is the most basic way for mages to travel.

245
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,470
If you cannot fly on a broom,
you shouldn't even be here.

246
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,890
All right, begin.

247
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,420
Just by observing this, we can get a good
idea of what kind of mages they are.

248
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,240
There are quite a few candidates this year.

249
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,210
For a kid from the boonies,
he's really amazing.

250
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,620
The genius chosen by the four-leaf...

251
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,710
What's the meaning of this?

252
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,850
No matter how much one might be lacking
in talent, they should at least float.

253
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,410
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

254
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,250
Talk about pathetic.

255
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,640
Guess we're down one rival already.

256
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,230
What is he even doing here?

257
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,740
Come on, this should be easy.

258
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,530
Loosen up a little bit. Just like this.

259
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,580
That's amazing, damn it!

260
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,500
Loosen up, all right?

261
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,530
Hey, you're a decent guy.

262
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,250
I still can't float...

263
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,510
Okay!

264
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,590
What are you doing?

265
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,850
Oh, I'm... um...

266
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:26,220
I told you. There's no need for royalty
to take the same exam as the peasants.

267
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,430
But...

268
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,690
Your destination has already been decided.

269
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,360
Do not take unnecessary action.

270
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,520
Yes, Brother Nozel.

271
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,430
Your existence itself is unnecessary.

272
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:53,300
Magical Ability Exam

273
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,550
Bah-ha!

274
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,300
It's okay. Just relax!

275
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,550
Bah-ha!

276
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,140
Magical Ability Control Exam

277
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,140
Don't worry about it. Just do your best.

278
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,270
Creation Magic Exam

279
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,460
Bah-ha!

280
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,130
I'm not done yet!

281
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,270
Next, next...

282
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,070
Developmental Magic Exam

283
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,920
Bah-ha!

284
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,070
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

285
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,810
All right. The next exam
shall be the last one.

286
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,450
You will engage in actual combat.

287
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,000
You'll be battling!

288
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,790
You will pair off and fight with your partner.
You may use your grimoires to attack.

289
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,060
If we lose, it'll severely
affect our evaluations.

290
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,720
Picking the right opponent will be key.

291
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,220
Fighting is our duty.
Show us your true abilities!

292
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,730
As soon as one of you yields or becomes
unable to fight, the exam will be over.

293
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,570
There will be mages who can use
healing magic on standby.

294
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,480
So fight to your heart's content!

295
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:59,060
C-Crap! All I've been doing so far is yelling.

296
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,590
I have to stand out by fighting
someone who looks strong.

297
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,740
Come on... I need to find
someone to fight me.

298
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,790
Bah-ha! Fight me, Asta.

299
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,170
Sekke! You're willing to
fight a loser like me?

300
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,180
But of course! Bah-ha!

301
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,800
You're such a great guy!

302
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,390
First combatants, come forward.

303
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,130
Yes, sir!

304
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,470
Bah-ha!

305
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,480
Let's both give it our all and fight fair,
so we can achieve our goals!

306
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,240
You don't have to try so hard anymore,

307
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,370
you filthy little rat that
wandered into the wrong place.

308
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,100
Thank you for making me
look even better so far.

309
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,260
I'll get into the Magic Knights and
do my best for the both of us,

310
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,580
and have a great time.

311
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,450
Got it, you miserable peasant?

312
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,170
Hurry back to your village in the boonies

313
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,980
and continue enjoying your crappy little life.

314
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,220
Bah-ha!

315
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,050
Sekke chose the weakest-looking guy.

316
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,610
Sekke...

317
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,150
Begin!

318
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,430
No holding back, all right?

319
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,410
Let's do this, Asta! Bah-ha!

320
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,420
Bronze Creation Magic:
Sekke Magnum Cannonball!

321
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,110
How do you like my magic?

322
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,260
It's bronzified and protects me
as it shoots out magical bullets.

323
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,170
It's offense and defense all in one!

324
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,330
It'll block all of your lame attacks,
which will show off my defensive powers,

325
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,800
and then I'll finish you off
once you've worn yourself out.

326
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,160
That's pretty decent for an exam candidate.

327
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,560
Doesn't he look like that spiky bug
from the Mimo Amazon?

328
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,070
There's no need to hold back.
Come at me! Bah-ha!

329
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,320
Now... Make sure you struggle as much
as you can to make things exciting!

330
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,130
Sure thing.

331
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,700
Here I go.

332
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,210
Huh?

333
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,230
Huh?

334
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,030
Huh?

335
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,030
Huh?

336
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,080
I'm not joining

337
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,980
the Magic Knights so I can have a
good time and avoid working hard.

338
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,290
I'm here to work my butt off
and become the Wizard King!

339
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,540
No one can escape from here

340
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:06,290
Once again in the small closed off classroom

341
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:14,600
The star of the class was shining yet again

342
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,980
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

343
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,480
I've thought many times

344
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,200
That the revolution was within my hands

345
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,720
Isn't it strange? If you want
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

346
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:42,630
The rest of us who were left
behind wanted to become something

347
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:49,880
We repeat the same morning over and over

348
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:56,770
You're the only one who
can choose your tomorrow

349
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,420
Let's go beyond our current selves

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,670
Hey! Get away from me! Buzz off!

356
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,550

But I'm not done yet! I can still do this!

361
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,110
I'm going to pass, no matter what!
