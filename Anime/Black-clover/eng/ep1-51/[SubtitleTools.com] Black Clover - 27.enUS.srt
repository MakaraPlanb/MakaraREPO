1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,180
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,140
Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!

5
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,270
Mine!

6
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,940
Remember this, Magic Knights.

7
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,660
We are the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

8
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,220
The ones who will destroy the Clover Kingdom.

9
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,580
Asta!

10
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,710
I've been waiting for you.

11
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,330
H-He's...

12
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,840
The Wizard King, Julius Novachrono?!

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,960
Kill him!

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,730
I-Impossible!

15
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,930
I killed them.

16
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,060
It would've been too difficult
with your numbers.

17
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,980
How about it? I'll let one of you
survive, so why not surrender?

18
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,900
It'll be first come, first served.

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,560
Don't underestimate us!

20
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,240
How is he moving like that?!
I can't keep up!

21
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,270
I guess I don't have a choice.

22
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,740
I might be able to handle these numbers.

23
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,440
Time Binding Magic: Chrono Stasis.

24
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,250
What... is this?

25
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,750
I can't move...

26
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,760
...at all.

27
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,580
I guess I was able to restrain all of you.

28
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,760
Were you more worn out than I thought?

29
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,660
Ow...

30
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,270
Hey there, Asta.

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,020
We seem to be connected by fate somehow.

32
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,770
R-Right...

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,650
You want to become the
Wizard King someday, right?

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,410
In that case, watch carefully
and don't look away.

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,410
This is only a small fraction
of what you'll have to surpass.

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,940
Something's coming?

37
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,500
That's blinding!

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,220
What is this light?!

39
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,740
I would always close my eyes

40
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,080
And cower at reality

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,770
I can't stand the idea

42
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,130
Of just making excuses to give up

43
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,340
Stand right there

44
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,400
I don't want to be near you

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,540
Any minute now

46
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,930
Just wait right there

47
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,930
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

48
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,020
Black and blue

49
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,940
I'll give up on giving up

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,440
And get the world on my side

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

52
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,330
Every time somewhere under this sky

53
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:53,180
Break through the tearful nights

54
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,460
And head where the light shines

55
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,300
I want to keep my promise

56
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,840
I'll deliver it to you

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,820
shape of love

58
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,560
Light

59
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,530
Everyone's gone!

60
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,660
Looks like he got us.

61
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,660
He took all of his little friends back.

62
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,870
Light magic that's faster than my own...
I wonder if that was the enemy's boss.

63
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,140
He seems interesting... I mean, formidable.

64
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,690
But...

65
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,840
We managed to keep one.

66
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,750
I finally got through.

67
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,010
Where are you, Wizard King?

68
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,690
Hello there, Marx.

69
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,880
Sorry about that. I've been a bit busy,
so I blocked the communication spell.

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,990
Never mind that. Please hurry
to the medical ward.

71
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,260
Fuegoleon... Leopold...

72
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,030
I hope they wake up soon.

73
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,010
Indeed.

74
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,310
We've strengthened the magic barrier
and repaired the communication spells.

75
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,930
We've gathered more Magic Knights

76
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,180
and are having them scout
every inch of the town

77
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,400
to ensure no enemies remain.

78
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,420
I'm sure the royal capital is fine now.

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,990
We're also looking for that awfully loudâ€”
er, lively Black Bulls boy.

80
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,410
He wouldn't die so easily!

81
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,740
Curse you, Asta. I'm going to
punch you when you get back.

82
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,820
This magic...

83
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,250
Hey, everyone. Great work.

84
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,010
Th-The Wizard King?

85
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,270
Asta!

86
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,890
H-Hey, guys. Looks like you're all here.

87
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,630
Is that... an enemy?

88
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,140
Man, I thought I was done for.

89
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,250
Hmph! It's because you're always so reckless.

90
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,210
I hope you learned your lesson, Stupidsta.

91
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,400
Thank goodness!

92
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,750
Asta!

93
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,190
You're safe, Asta!

94
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,090
I'm... I'm so glad you came back alive!

95
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,780
I thought you were dead. I'm so glad.

96
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,330
Y-Yeah... Thanks for worrying about me.

97
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,290
I thought you were going to punch him.

98
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,260
Asta!

99
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,190
I was so, so worried about you!

100
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,140
I-I'm sorry!

101
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,720
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

102
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,720
I see...

103
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,950
Despite how strong Fuegoleon is,
we don't know when he'll wake up.

104
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,850
That was a miscalculation on my part.

105
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,270
No, this was due to our inexperience.

106
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,490
We've confirmed that the pendant
Fuegoleon was wearing is missing.

107
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,170
Pendant?

108
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,750
Could that be what they were after?

109
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,670
Who in the world could they be?

110
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,940
From what they said,

111
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,260
they appear to be a terrorist group
with a grudge against the kingdom.

112
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,070
We are the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

113
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,760
The ones who will destroy the Clover Kingdom.

114
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,110
But it doesn't seem to be that simple.

115
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,770
The jewels embedded into that stone slab...

116
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,020
Was Fuegoleon's pendant a part of that?

117
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,340
It had several holes
that were still empty,

118
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,530
but what happens when
they gather all of them?

119
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,040
There is the possibility that Fuegoleon
was targeted because of his pendant,

120
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,450
but there's also a high possibility

121
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,540
that his strength and ideals
would've gotten in their way.

122
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,570
I've been investigating
various dissidents in secret,

123
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,300
and this is the first time
I've picked up their trail.

124
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,300
But to think that they were planning
something that extraordinary and powerful.

125
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,540
Maybe I shouldn't have left the capital.

126
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,670
We'll get the details from our captive later.

127
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,310
In any case,

128
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,740
people look to the
Magic Knights for one thing...

129
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,650
Peace in the Clover Kingdom.

130
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,570
In order to preserve that, we'll keep
fighting with everything we have.

131
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,560
Yes, sir!

132
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,830
If you'll excuse me.

133
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,500
Nozel...

134
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,270
What is that guy's problem?

135
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,590
We're supposed to be showing solidarity
right now. Take the hint, man!

136
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,120
Has the enemy

137
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,090
awakened not a sleeping lion,
but a sleeping hawk?

138
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,340
Pathetic.

139
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,060
What an appalling spectacle.

140
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,880
Never let this happen again, Nozel.

141
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,600
And Fuegoleon, I will find
the scum who did this to you

142
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,750
and slay them myself.

143
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,500
I hope I never feel this useless again.

144
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,210
Right.

145
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,030
We shall become stronger.

146
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,430
Indeed.

147
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,120
I'm the one who'll become the strongest!

148
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,590
Leopold!

149
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,500
You need to be resting!

150
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,160
Asta! I'm relieved that
we both pulled through!

151
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,510
As my rival who has faced death
with me, you must also get stronger!

152
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,270
I will surpass my brother!

153
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,310
I'm going to be the next Wizard King!

154
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,770
And this...

155
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,030
Fuegoleon,

156
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,760
what is that mark on your forehead?

157
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,780
Ah, this?

158
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,290
This mark is handed down in the Vermillion
family as a sign of a personal oath.

159
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,290
It's worn only by those prepared to
conquer themselves and become king.

160
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,960
This... is the mark of my oath.

161
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,610
Yeah! I don't really get it, but it looks
like you're worthy to be my rival.

162
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,520
So... who the heck are you, anyway?!

163
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,480
What?!

164
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,540
How?! How could you still not know who I am?!

165
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,590
I only remember people who
properly introduce themselves!

166
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,450
I am Leopold Vermillion!

167
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,560
We're going to be friends,
so call me Leo!

168
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,640
Y-You're moving way too fast!

169
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,850
I don't want to hear that from you!

170
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,450
The Wizard King concluded that
the attack on the royal capital

171
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,750
had been the work of
anti-Clover Kingdom terrorists.

172
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,500
He declared his intent to continue
resolutely opposing them,

173
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,610
and the masses were fully supportive.

174
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,930
The enemy's invasion was enabled by

175
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,530
the disappearance of some of the mages who
maintained the capital's magic barrier.

176
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,100
Had the enemy done away
with them, or had they defected?

177
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:19,780
This fact was not made public,
but the Wizard King was sure of it.

178
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,280
I don't want to believe it,

179
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,740
but there's a traitor among the
mages in the royal capital.

180
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,840
Interrogation Room

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,840
It's no use.

182
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,850
There's some kind of protection on them,

183
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,710
and I can't search for information.

184
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,090
Even if there wasn't, we'd never talk.

185
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,620
Our master is the light in the darkness!

186
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,360
He's our god!

187
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,370
He's the only one who hasn't abandoned us.

188
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,620
We will never betray him.

189
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:19,630
Apparently, their master has some absolute
unifying force and fearsome magical power.

190
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm assuming the one who defeated
Captain Fuegoleon is also their master.

191
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,890
Indeed.

192
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,890
When he wakes up, we may learn something.

193
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,250
Let us wait for the Lion King to awaken.

194
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,020
Damn it! Damn it!

195
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,070
Damn it!

196
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,860
Damn it all to hell!

197
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,690
They hurt. They hurt...

198
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,370
My wounds hurt!

199
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,580
That stupid little brat Asta...

200
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,870
I'm going to kill him, no matter what!

201
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,090
I'm going to gather the
ultimate army of the dead!

202
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,080
That anti-magic kid, Asta...

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,240
You can't kill him, Rades.

204
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,540
I want to tinker with him
while he's still alive.

205
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,550
What?

206
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,640
Not to mention, I already
treated your wounds,

207
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,930
so there's no way they'd still be hurting.

208
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,920
Shut up! They still ache!

209
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,750
I saw that brat first!

210
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,820
Hands off, Sally!

211
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,130
Can't hear you, can't hear you,
can't hear you!

212
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,890
I hope I see you again soon, Asta!

213
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,090
For the next time I see you, Asta...

214
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,590
I'll use the little samples
I got while you were in the gel,

215
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,740
and research and research!

216
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,850
I couldn't save Geork and Catherine.

217
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,860
Those two have big egos,
but they worship you.

218
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,060
They won't give them any information on us.

219
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,110
That's not what I'm worried about.

220
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,490
As long as they're alive, I will
save them, no matter what.

221
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,180
I thought I had dodged it, but I seem
to have taken a little of the attack.

222
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,810
Magic that accelerates
time... and drastically.

223
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,640
The Wizard King... As expected,
he has phenomenal power.

224
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,900
But we will build up our
strength and defeat him.

225
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:56,260
In order to get our revenge and establish
a new country that will be ours alone.

226
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,040
Mister and Miss Magic Knight,

227
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,250
thank you for saving me!

228
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,200
No problem!

229
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,550
I just did the obvious thing.

230
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,050
This is to thank you. I made them myself.

231
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,270
They look great!

232
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,360
Thank you so much!

233
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,430
Bye, now!

234
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,380
So good!

235
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,050
Why...

236
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,070
...are you here, Charmy?

237
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,490
Where the nummy things are,
there I shall be!

238
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,790
More importantly, have a bite.

239
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,510
La? La?

240
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,960
Uh, she gave those to us...

241
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,410
Don't sweat the details.

242
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,300
Come on. They're delicious.

243
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,450
Th-Thanks?

244
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,990
I guess I don't mind having one...

245
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,450
It's good!

246
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,460
What a surprise. It's actually good.

247
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,570
You seem to be in an unusually good mood.

248
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,220
I had a fateful encounter.

249
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,790
You're probably too young to understand.

250
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,410
By the way, how did you get into the castle?

251
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,950
Like this!

252
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,660
Seriously?

253
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,130
Is her magic actually really amazing?

254
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,140
That's...

255
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,370
Hey!

256
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,230
It's Asta and Noelle.

257
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,320
Asta!

258
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,730
Have your wounds fully healed?
I asked you that before, didn't I?

259
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,440
I'm fine, like I said before!

260
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,380
Yuno, I heard you took down the enemy
like it was nothing, you jerkface!

261
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,450
Jerkface?

262
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,990
My meal-saving prince!

263
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,450
Hey, Yuno! Greet me properly, you jerk!

264
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,410
Wait, you know my prince?

265
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,610
Don't get a big head just
because you took one down!

266
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,750
Courtesy makes the world go round!

267
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,050
Yuno?

268
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,850
Huh? Was that too much?

269
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,830
What do you think you're doing, Yuno?!

270
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,970
Is he stupid?! Was he
actually trying to kill us?

271
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,840
See ya, Shrimpsta

272
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,250
See ya, Shrimpsta.

273
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,590
Who are you calling "Shrimpsta,"
Yuno, you jerk?!

274
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,690
Come down here and fight me right now!

275
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,730
Don't shoot something like that
just so you can write magic letters!

276
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,140
Don't you dare ignore me and leave!

277
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,230
Ah, the ferocious storm of love.

278
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,300
Ignoring me is the worst thing you could do!

279
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,590
Hey, wait, Yuno!

280
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,060
Yuno's magic has gotten much stronger.

281
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,870
What could've happened in
such a short amount of time?

282
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,870
Asta,

283
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,030
I'm going to get stronger,

284
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,980
so the next time we meet, I'll be
able to fight alongside you!

285
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,880
And then... And then...

286
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,890
I guess we'll just have to fight
when we both get a lot stronger.

287
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,290
I'm not going to lose, Yuno!

288
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,650
The stronger you become,
I'll get even stronger!

289
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,650
Black Bulls' Base

290
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,650
Welcome back, Magna, Luck!

291
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,060
Man, I'm so exhausted from my mission.

292
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,990
So tired.

293
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,060
However!

294
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,370
We got recognized for our
deeds and got a star!

295
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,710
That's right, Magna!

296
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,710
Not so close!

297
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,010
Our combo attack, the Crackling Magna
Typhoon, was amazing, wasn't it?

298
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,550
Crackling Magna Typhoon

299
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,550
We're never doing that move again!

300
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,550
Thank goodness you're all back safe.

301
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:27,330
I'm gonna keep on showing the
other Black Bulls how it's done!

302
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,310
Asta, my time has arrived!
Make sure you keep up!

303
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,410
Yes, sir!

304
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,010
Oh, by the way, Magna.

305
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,820
What's up?

306
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,740
They were so impressed with what I did
during all the trouble at the capital

307
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,150
that they made me a third-class junior
Magic Knight at a special awards ceremony!

308
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,850
Huh?

309
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,850
What?!

310
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,520
Wait, what's a third-class
junior Magic Knight?

311
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,330
No idea.

312
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,560
What?!

313
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,530
Have you guys been Magic Knights all
this time without knowing what that is?

314
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,470
It's a Magic Knight rank.

315
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,870
And since you guys haven't
changed since you all joined,

316
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,350
you're still fifth-class Magic Knights.

317
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,340
Better start showing Asta some respect.

318
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,600
What?!

319
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,600
Huh?

320
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,140
And by the way, Charmy became
a first-class junior Magic Knight.

321
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,360
On your knees, inferiors!

322
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,460
What?!

323
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,990
Make sure you follow me, you inferiors!

324
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,990
Apparently, they were impressed that
she captured one of the rebels.

325
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,010
Looks to me like she was just trying
to beat her up, though.

326
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,150
Worship me!

327
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,180
What's that weird dance?

328
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,130
This is somehow very infuriating!

329
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,100
Anyway, well done, kid.

330
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,680
But Captain Fuegoleon...

331
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,390
Huh? Fuegoleon?

332
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,900
Who do you think you're worrying about, punk?

333
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,530
That hot-blooded king of seriousness
won't die that easily.

334
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,400
I bet he'll come back even stronger.

335
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,610
Of course!

336
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,650
All right! I'm going to train even
harder and get stronger, too!

337
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,660
No, you're gonna rest.

338
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,730
Huh?

339
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,510
You're too injured. You're going
to die. Are you stupid?

340
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,420
But you made me do it in the first place!

341
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,290
Yeah! You need to take a break!

342
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,410
You too, Noelle?

343
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,420
How stupid are you?

344
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,130
A break...

345
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,930
A break? You're getting time off, Asta?

346
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,300
Then let's head to a mixer!

347
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,310
Huh?!

348
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,430
A m-mixer?!

349
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,560
You get to work.

350
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,740
I'll set everything up!

351
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,810
I just told you to get to work.

352
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,910
Things are getting busy!

353
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,060
I'll kill you.

354
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,820
Wait, do you wanna come too, Captain Yami?

355
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

356
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,570
And push me forward

357
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,640
(I can't find a place to go)

358
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

359
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:22,390
And change the flow of time

360
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,810
(I will keep believing in you)

361
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,690
In this ever-vivid place

362
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,660
(Break free yourself)

363
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

364
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,190
If there is a path that I should choose

365
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

366
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,160
Wherever it may lead us

367
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,650
Until my life comes to an end

368
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

369
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

370
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

371
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:58,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

372
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

373
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,290
Petit Clover

374
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,770
Petit Clover!

375
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,790
Captain Yami's Lecture
on Magic Knight Rankings

376
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,210
"Captain Yami's"... Wait, what is this?

377
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,690
"Magic Knight"... Ugh, I can't be bothered.

378
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,290
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
1st Class Junior Magic Knight
2nd Class Junior Magic Knight

379
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:33,590
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight
1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight
1st Class Junior Magic Knight
2nd Class Junior Magic Knight
3rd Class Junior Magic Knight
4th Class Junior Magic Knight
5th Class Junior Magic Knight

380
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,220
So the most important is the Wizard King,
and then there's Grand Magic Knight...

381
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,580
This is too much work.

382
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,590
Why are you making a
Grand Magic Knight read this?

383
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,950
I'll kill you!

384
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,060
What?!

385
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,480
Is this what they call love?

386
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,770
My meal-saving prince!

387
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,030
Black Clover, Page 28:
"The One I've Set My Heart On."

388
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:57,000
Page 28
The One I've Set My Heart On

389
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,700
Wait, is Asta falling in love, too?
