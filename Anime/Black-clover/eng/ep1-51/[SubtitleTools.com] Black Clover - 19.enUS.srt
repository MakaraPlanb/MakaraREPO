1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,350
The strong will survive...

5
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,790
and the weak...

6
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,020
Mimosa!

7
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,650
Your opponent...

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,920
is me!

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,160
Disappear!

10
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,410
As long as he has that recovery magic,

11
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,230
I won't be able to finish him off!

12
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,610
What should I do?

13
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,630
What are you doing, Stupidsta?

14
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,890
You're the first peasant...

15
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,020
that I, a royal, ever acknowledged.

16
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,390
Hurry up and

17
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,860
defeat that guy, Asta!

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,430
Yeah, leave it to me.

19
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,990
I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!

20
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,490
...that weakling, disappear!

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,470
Like hell I'll let that happen!

22
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,720
I don't have any magic,

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,290
but I've got...

24
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,950
my friends!

25
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,340
I don't really get it, but I did it!

26
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,810
I would always close my eyes

27
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,010
And cower at reality

28
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,770
I can't stand the idea

29
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,140
Of just making excuses to give up

30
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,260
Stand right there

31
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,420
I don't want to be near you

32
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,450
Any minute now

33
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,880
Just wait right there

34
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,880
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

35
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,060
Black and blue

36
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,990
I'll give up on giving up

37
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,110
And get the world on my side

38
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,780
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

39
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,120
Every time somewhere under this sky

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,180
Break through the tearful nights

41
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,420
And head where the light shines

42
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,260
I want to keep my promise

43
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,050
I'll deliver it to you

44
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,820
shape of love

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,530
Destruction and Salvation

46
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,810
I messed up...

47
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,580
Asta...

48
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,830
Asta!

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,520
Mimosa, I'm fine now, so please
just take care of Asta!

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,090
R-Right!

51
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,220
I'm not sure if my remaining
magic will be enough.

52
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,250
Asta!

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,700
Brat! Open your eyes!

54
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,380
Where's all that energy you just had?!

55
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,080
You can't die before I kill you!

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,050
Asta!

57
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,860
Can you hear me, Asta?

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,980
You're not alone!

59
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,190
Mars, is the training painful?

60
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,750
When things get rough,
remember the faces of those you love.

61
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,250
We were born to protect the people
of this kingdom that we love so much.

62
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,770
Once we become strong enough to protect
this kingdom, we'll be allowed to go outside.

63
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,040
You'll probably make it out first, Mars.

64
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,030
Lucky.

65
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,550
I mean, you're the strongest
out of all of us, Mars.

66
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,040
I'll be waiting for you when that happens.

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,280
Huh?

68
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,900
Until you get out, too, Fana.

69
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,210
Sure! Let's go see the
outside world together.

70
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,470
This is your final test.

71
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,700
Kill each other.

72
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,440
The sole survivor will be allowed to go
outside as our kingdom's mage warrior.

73
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,140
If you refuse, you'll all be disposed of.

74
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,900
I'm sorry, Mars.

75
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,420
Fana...

76
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,810
I have no other choice.

77
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,560
Please die.

78
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,040
Looks like Mars is the one who survived.

79
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,060
Then let's implant him with the magic stones.

80
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,250
Let's go ahead and give him
Fana's powers, too, since she was

81
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,190
the last one he killed.

82
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,290
Now we'll finally have the
ultimate mage warrior.

83
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,380
I'm... fine alone,

84
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,380
because I have extremely powerful magic.

85
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,540
Those without magic are weak.

86
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,470
And the weak will die.

87
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,220
He's...

88
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,810
...still moving!

89
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,310
It can't happen...

90
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:45,810
Someone as naïve as you
cannot win against me!

91
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,670
Asta!

92
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,960
His flame recovery magic should've
been negated by Asta's attack.

93
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,670
This is the perfect opportunity
to finish him, but...

94
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,050
Just a little more... Just a little more,
and I can break through these restraints.

95
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,170
Die!

96
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,540
Asta!

97
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,040
No matter what spell I pick from
my grimoire, I won't make it in time.

98
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,610
I won't let him die here!

99
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,570
Did Yuno just do that?

100
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,990
What just happened?

101
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,400
The spell... has been broken.

102
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,830
Yuno! What did you do?

103
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,720
Was that magic? What did you use?

104
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,850
I'm not sure.

105
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,410
You're not sure?

106
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,050
There was a little girl, and...

107
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,610
A little girl?

108
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,820
Well...

109
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,510
You must be tired.

110
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,460
Let us talk later.

111
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,880
More importantly,

112
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,380
we've defeated him for sure this time.

113
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,850
These are...

114
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,810
the characters from that scroll.

115
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,570
Asta...

116
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,490
What's...

117
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,250
Is this a trap?

118
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,770
The dungeon is falling apart!

119
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,650
Celestial Wind Ark!

120
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,750
Everyone, get on!

121
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,060
We're getting out.

122
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,410
We're ready, Yuno.

123
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,280
Mimosa, take care of Asta.

124
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,300
I will.

125
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,430
Him...

126
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,860
You shouldn't talk now.

127
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,300
Save him... please.

128
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,010
What are you saying?

129
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,890
He tried to kill us!

130
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,630
We...

131
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,150
came to conquer this dungeon.

132
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,270
Not... to kill...

133
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,160
an enemy.

134
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:15,170
It might be a waste to let
someone that strong die here.

135
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,030
It's too late! We won't make
it out in time. Let's go!

136
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,450
Where's the exit?

137
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,940
Mimosa can't use her
Magic Flower Guidepost right now.

138
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,530
Go right. I'll guide us out.

139
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,360
Got it.

140
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,660
Left.

141
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,620
Okay.

142
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,270
Keep going straight.

143
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,070
Okay.

144
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,460
I managed to hit it.

145
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,740
More coming!

146
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,690
Got it!

147
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,630
I've already acknowledged
you as my... as our friend!

148
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,290
We won't let...

149
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,510
...Asta die.

150
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,470
We'll save Asta!

151
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,130
We'll get out of here...

152
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,800
...alive!

153
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,480
We made it out.

154
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,590
We did it.

155
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,550
That was fun!

156
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,750
Honestly...

157
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,810
We'll head over there.

158
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,820
Man... We sure were lucky
they created a path for us.

159
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,570
Because of this old man's ultimate
trump card, Hermit's Thick Smoke,

160
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,830
they never realized we were
close by the whole time.

161
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,540
Anyway, thank goodness you're alive.

162
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,590
I'm sorry, Mars.

163
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,530
Fana...

164
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,430
I have no other choice.

165
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,550
Please die.

166
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,500
Why...

167
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,290
Why?

168
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,930
My wounds...

169
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,270
If I didn't do that, you wouldn't have...

170
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,150
Fana...

171
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,460
Fana!

172
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,170
Oh? Are you awake, Mars?

173
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,430
Lotus...

174
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,790
Great work back there.

175
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,180
Thanks to you, I was able
to get all this treasure.

176
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,720
Now the people of our kingdom,
as well as my daughters,

177
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,700
will be able to eat delicious things.

178
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,450
I remember everything.

179
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,550
Make sure you go see the world outside.

180
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,970
For me... as well.

181
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,720
Lotus...

182
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,980
You saved me. Thank you.

183
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,480
Well, how about that?

184
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,780
You can actually say things like that.

185
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,740
Everyone...

186
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,920
Asta.

187
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,060
Asta!

188
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,250
Asta!

189
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,960
Hooray.

190
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,830
Ow...

191
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,700
Hmph! As long as you're okay, Stupidsta.

192
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,550
It's unbelievable.
Your recuperative ability is amazing.

193
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,510
He's resilient, if nothing else.

194
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,560
What'd you say, Yuno?!

195
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,880
I'm more than just resilient... ow, ow, ow...

196
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,240
I-I'm so sorry! I didn't have
enough magic to fully heal you.

197
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,470
I just did what I could for now,
so you probably shouldn't move.

198
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,540
N-No worries.

199
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,970
You saved me. Thanks.

200
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,530
N-No problem at all!

201
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,630
R-Really...

202
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,580
I thought you were going to
die before I got to kill you.

203
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,850
I won't die. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

204
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,310
Not until I become the Wizard King.

205
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,250
Not a chance.

206
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,110
I'm the one who's going
to be the Wizard King.

207
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,630
Hup. Ow, ow, ow, ow...

208
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,110
Don't use my body as a crutch.

209
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,860
What's the big deal?
It's not like I'm hurting you.

210
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,370
You two...

211
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,930
Klaus.

212
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,590
I'm so...

213
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,150
sorry!

214
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,030
I'm so ashamed that I didn't acknowledge
you just because you were peasants!

215
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,650
Both of you are...

216
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,940
magnificent Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom!

217
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,160
Klaus...

218
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,730
Klaus.

219
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,430
You're suffocating us.

220
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,090
Lord Four-Eyes... it hurts.

221
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,050
What?! And after I just...

222
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,980
Who knew you were such a good four-eyes?

223
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,540
What do you mean by that, you fool?!

224
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,250
You're just too serious, Klaus.

225
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,170
Hey, hey, Yuno!

226
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,690
Let's fight sometime.

227
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,690
No.

228
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,380
Hey, Noelle. Your clothes are all ripped up.

229
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,460
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

230
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,030
Oh, he died.

231
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,040
Asta!

232
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,060
I couldn't help myself! Stupidsta!

233
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,420
Wake up!

234
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,260
Asta!

235
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,680
What are you staring at?

236
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,110
Ow!

237
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,440
Hmph.

238
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,780
Ow, ow, ow...

239
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,700
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

240
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,670
And push me forward

241
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,610
(I can't find a place to go)

242
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,990
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

243
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:51,490
And change the flow of time

244
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,910
(I will keep believing in you)

245
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,790
In this ever-vivid place

246
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,630
(Break free yourself)

247
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,630
In order to grasp my endless dream

248
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,290
If there is a path that I should choose

249
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,350
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

250
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,260
Wherever it may lead us

251
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,750
Until my life comes to an end

252
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,430
I will accept any pain that comes my way

253
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,450
(We can try again, we can try again)

254
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,810
Even if we can't see tomorrow

255
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:27,810
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

256
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,090
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

257
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,340
Petit Clover

258
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,470
Petit Clover!

259
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,840
So You Can Actually
Say Things Like That

260
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,260
So You Can Actually Say Things Like That.

261
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,100
You saved me. Thank you.

262
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,870
Well, how about that?

263
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,260
You can actually say things like that.

264
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,110
I can.

265
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,110
Then how about this?

266
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,340
She sells seashells by the seashore.

267
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,210
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

268
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,780
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

269
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,120
I can.

270
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,610
She sells... she shells... seashore.

271
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,350
Peter Piper picked...
a pick of peckled pippers.

272
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,380
How much wood could...
a woodchuck... chuck...

273
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,630
So you can't.

274
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,380
I can.

275
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,750
She sells she shells by the she shore.

276
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,950
Peter Piper pipped a
pep of pippled peppers.

277
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,820
How much wood could a
woodchuck... could... chuck...

278
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,020
I can't!

279
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,350
We did it! Did you see that?!

280
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,190
I did it, Sister!

281
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,190
Wait, what?! We just met the Wizard King!

Assembly at the Royal Capital

284
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,740
Being loud is my magic!
