1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,680
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,650
In a certain world,
where magic is everything...

5
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,350
Asta and Yuno were abandoned
on the same day at

6
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,300
a church in the village of Hage,
which lies in the boonies.

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,600
They both dreamed of becoming the Wizard
King, the highest rank among mages,

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,530
and worked hard every day.

9
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,950
In the year they turned fifteen,

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,370
they both received grimoires,
which enhance the owner's magical powers.

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,500
They then took the Magic Knights
Entrance Exam to join

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,210
the Magic Knights, which are
led by the Wizard King.

13
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,920
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!

14
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,390
As a result, because Yuno possesses
immense magical powers,

15
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,060
out of the nine squads, he chose
the elite Golden Dawn to join.

16
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,270
As for Asta, who had no magical powers,

17
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,980
he ended up joining the squad
of rogues, the Black Bulls.

18
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,820
I'm still going to become
the Wizard King someday!

19
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,470
Thus the two finally took the first step
toward becoming the Wizard King.

20
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,140
Wh-What's going on?

21
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,970
Wh-What the heck is this?!

22
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,360
Sir, there's trouble. An anomaly—

23
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,050
An anomaly has occurred, right?

24
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,620
Well... Let's have them work on this mission.

25
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,290
Them?

26
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,810
I would always close my eyes

27
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,010
And cower at reality

28
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,770
I can't stand the idea

29
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,230
Of just making excuses to give up

30
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,100
Stand right there

31
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,400
I don't want to be near you

32
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,350
Any minute now

33
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,940
Just wait right there

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,940
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

35
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,100
Black and blue

36
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,990
I'll give up on giving up

37
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,160
And get the world on my side

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,830
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

39
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,160
Every time somewhere under this sky

40
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,180
Break through the tearful nights

41
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,470
And head where the light shines

42
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,300
I want to keep my promise

43
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,850
I'll deliver it to you

44
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,820
shape of love

45
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,570
Dungeon

46
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Black Bulls' Base

47
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,840
Hey, Magna. Let's fight. No holding back.

48
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,110
Nine hundred eighty-two...

49
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,050
Nine hundred eighty-three...

50
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,830
No way, you battle-obsessed freak.

51
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,650
Nine hundred eighty-four...

52
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,830
Oh, come on. Let's do it.

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,070
Nine hundred eighty-five...

54
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,060
I'm gonna eat your pudding.

55
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,730
Nine hundred eighty-six...

56
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,460
If you do that, I'll—

57
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,890
Nine hundred eighty-seven...

58
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,410
Will you fight me?!

59
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,340
Will you?!

60
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,140
No.

61
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,890
Nine hundred eighty-eight...

62
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,490
Aw...

63
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,050
Nine hundred eighty-nine...

64
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,050
Silvantus Schnauzer.

65
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,420
Nine hundred ninety...

66
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,890
I think something else would be better.

67
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,850
Nine hundred ninety-one...

68
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,200
Let's see... Like "Wine"!

69
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,400
Nine hundred ninety-two...

70
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,370
Nine hundred ninety-three...

71
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,650
Wine?

72
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,100
Nine hundred ninety-four...

73
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,770
I will allow you to borrow a single letter

74
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,210
Nine hundred ninety-five...

75
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,040
from the name of my little sister,
the goddess Marie.

76
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,930
Nine hundred ninety-six...

77
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,580
I will let you take the "M." Be grateful.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,440
Nine hundred ninety-seven...

79
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,530
Make it something cooler!

80
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,200
Nine hundred ninety-eight...

81
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,200
Like, let's see...

82
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,180
Nine hundred ninety-nine...

83
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,920
Magnam Fire!

84
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,920
One thousand...

85
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,670
Lame.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,380
One thousand and one...

87
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,010
You have no taste, Lady Noe.

88
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,920
More like you don't.

89
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,070
One thousand and two...

90
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,710
Thinking of names looks like fun.

91
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,530
One thousand and three...

92
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,570
I thought of one, too. I wonder if
they'll ask. I think it's a good name.

93
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,570
One thousand and four...

94
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,740
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

95
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,740
One thousand and five...

96
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,940
Can I fatten that bird up?
He looks really yummy.

97
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,370
One thousand and six...

98
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,940
One thousand and seven...

99
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,820
Absolutely not!

100
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,360
One thousand and eight...

101
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,820
Does he lay eggs?

102
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,800
Huh?

103
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,780
Definitely Toritaro!

104
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,390
No, it's Silvantus Schnauzer.

105
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,360
Toritaro!

106
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,350
Silvantus Schnauzer!

107
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,810
Toritaro!

108
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,680
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

109
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,950
The heck was that for, Toritaro?!

110
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,400
There, you see?

111
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,220
You prefer Silvantus Schnauzer, don't you?

112
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,090
Right? Right?

113
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,760
Magnam Fire!

114
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
"M."

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,890
Wine!

116
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,930
Why not Nero?

117
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,600
What?!

118
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,260
Looks like he approves.

119
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,900
"Nero" means "black."

120
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,020
Nero?

121
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,980
All right, listen up.

122
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,810
Mister Yami! Hello!

123
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,120
We're back, everyone.

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,730
Welcome back.

125
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,760
What did they want at the castle?

126
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,960
If it's a mission, I want
to go with everyone, too.

127
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,570
Mission? Is it a mission?

128
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,930
I have an announcement for you all.

129
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,350
A new dungeon has been discovered.

130
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,070
A dungeon?!

131
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,770
Are you serious, Mister Yami?!

132
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,480
What the heck is a dungeon?!

133
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,790
Huh?

134
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,650
Are you serious? You were surprised,
and you didn't even know what it is?

135
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,030
I just went with the flow!

136
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,870
Talk about predictable!

137
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,800
Listen up. Dungeons are...

138
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,680
Kind of like ancient tombs that contain
relics made by the people from back then.

139
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,160
Sometimes they have info
about powerful ancient magic

140
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,690
or super rare magical items.

141
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,260
They're absolutely amazing!

142
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,150
But you know...

143
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,260
The people back then set
insane magical traps in them

144
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,080
so that they wouldn't get misused by anyone.

145
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,310
They're super dangerous and really fun!

146
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,630
The Magic Knights always investigate them
since they're so dangerous,

147
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,570
and to make sure none of
the treasures get stolen.

148
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,540
Oh, okay!

149
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,650
I see.

150
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,180
Which means the Black Bulls are
supposed to investigate this

151
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,870
newly discovered dungeon?

152
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,360
Yes.

153
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:10,380
Clover
Kingdom

154
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,750
Particularly because this dungeon
popped up near our enemy's border.

155
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,380
Dungeon

156
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,800
Enemy?

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,380
Diamond
Kingdom

158
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,380
The Diamond Kingdom.

159
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:17,890
We need to take care of this mission fast
so Diamond's people won't steal anything.

160
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,620
By the way, there have been instances
in which someone found a magical item

161
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,220
that could change civilization
itself in a dungeon,

162
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,120
and someone even learned how
to use the ultimate magic there.

163
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,160
Me! Me! Please let me go!

164
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,040
I might be able to use
the ultimate magic, too!

165
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,970
You don't have any magic,
so that's not happening.

166
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,740
You never know!

167
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,540
Actually, you can go, kid.

168
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,750
In fact, the Wizard King chose you himself.

169
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,250
Huh?

170
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,020
Huh?!

171
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,050
The Wizard King?! Why?!

172
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,710
That's awesome, Asta!

173
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,960
What the heck? Did you bump
into the Wizard King somewhere?

174
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,270
No, never!

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,810
The Wizard King chose me!

176
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,620
I don't know why, but...

177
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,940
Great Wizard King!

178
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,780
Asta the Unworthy will give
his all on this mission!

179
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,800
Noelle, you're also going with him.

180
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,820
Huh?

181
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Everything counts as experience.

182
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,090
Oh, and Luck.

183
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,720
You're the leader.

184
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,050
I'm leaving those two to you.

185
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,050
Really?

186
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,970
Yup.

187
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,680
You'll lose your touch if you
stay cooped up all the time.

188
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,800
Yay!

189
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,300
Listen up. Make sure you
look after the newbies.

190
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,130
Leave it to me!

191
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,830
I want to go, too. I wish
they'd take me with them.

192
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,790
Be careful.

193
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,500
Asta! Lady Noe! Give it your all!

194
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,430
Got it!

195
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,820
I guess I don't have a choice.

196
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,140
I think I'll go find some cute girls, then.

197
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,290
Huh?

198
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,620
May I go see my sister?

199
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,630
If you're prepared to die.

200
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,680
The sunset is beautiful from here.

201
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,950
I recommend this location for dates.

202
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,770
I'll have some nummies ready
for you when you get back!

203
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,300
We're counting on you.

204
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,430
Got it.

205
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,440
Okay!

206
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,420
Let's see... It's this way.

207
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,730
They could've just dropped us off
right in front of the dungeon.

208
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,960
Finral's only able to go to
places he's been to before.

209
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,430
But thankfully, it was
still near the dungeon.

210
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go!

211
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,730
Why the heck did you come?

212
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,740
I wonder how the Wizard
King even knew about Asta.

213
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,490
That guy...

214
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,320
is able to see things we can't.

215
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,500
He's also a weirdo.

216
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,020
It's so dark.

217
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,420
Don't cling to me. It's hard to walk.

218
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,310
Wh-Who's clinging?

219
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,930
I can't see anything!

220
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,050
Ow...

221
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,830
Hey, could you not step on my foot?

222
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,450
I can't help it! It's pitch black in here!

223
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,300
Stop being so pissy.

224
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,970
It's all because you broke the lamp!

225
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,840
Honestly, you have some nerve.

226
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,820
It's your fault for tripping
and running into me!

227
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,990
How dare you? I'm royalty!

228
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,180
So what?!

229
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,250
Insect.

230
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,510
Is this it?

231
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,850
W-Wow!

232
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,640
What the heck's going on with this place?

233
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,170
What is this?

234
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,020
Looks like the space is
warped because of magic.

235
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,570
There's even stronger mana floating
around here than outside.

236
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,020
Yes. I've never been anywhere
this full of mana before.

237
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,080
Really?

238
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,270
Are you saying you can't feel all this mana?

239
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,910
Not at all.

240
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,090
Amazing. I guess people who don't
have magic really are different.

241
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,050
Shut up!

242
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,400
I want to feel mana, too!

243
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,250
I want mana!

244
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,170
Must be nice being one of you royals!

245
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,560
You have a ridiculous amount of mana!

246
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,380
In my body, I don't have even an ounce

247
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,610
of the foundation of magic... Mana!

248
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,400
God damn!

249
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,120
Huh?

250
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,660
T-Trap magic?

251
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,620
That was dangerous. Be more careful.

252
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,160
My bad.

253
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,180
Here it is, Asta.

254
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,680
This.

255
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,310
Where?

256
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,500
Hup.

257
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,650
What was that for?!

258
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,780
That was amazing!

259
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,590
Listen, you!

260
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,450
Oh, there's another one.

261
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,830
Hup!

262
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,930
Whee!

263
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,050
And another one!

264
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,190
This is so much fun!

265
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,690
Isn't this exciting?

266
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,690
We're going to die if we stay with this guy.

267
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,190
I wonder if those kids are okay.

268
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,410
The more dangerous the mission, the more
newbies will surpass their limits and grow.

269
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,800
I think.

270
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,360
You think?

271
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,210
Well, Luck's with them,
so they should be fine.

272
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,400
His ability to detect mana is off the charts.
It's even greater than a noble's.

273
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,840
If his personality wasn't so messed up,
any other squad would've taken him.

274
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,850
I think it's that personality
we're worried about.

275
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,490
Yeah.

276
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,570
Man... Your anti-magic weapon is amazing.

277
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,860
I wonder if that's why the
Wizard King chose you.

278
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,060
I'd love to fight you for real
in about two to three years!

279
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,910
If you're prepared to keep swinging
your sword around like that,

280
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,880
this dungeon won't be any problem.

281
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,790
Got it!

282
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,610
Now, then...

283
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,880
I think I'm about to reach my limit.

284
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,240
I knew it.

285
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,610
There are others here.

286
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,300
The strongest looking one is...

287
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,410
Lightning Creation Magic:

288
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,330
Holy Lightning Boots.

289
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,330
Something important just came up.

290
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,920
So I'm leaving the dungeon
exploration to you guys!

291
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,620
Hey, where are you—

292
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,680
Wh-What in the world is he thinking?!

293
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,040
S-So cool!

294
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,020
This is insane!

295
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,970
Left turn next...

296
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,960
I can't wait to see how
strong this person is!

297
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,510
Honestly... He's unbelievable.

298
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,710
Captain Yami clearly told him to
keep an eye on us, and he just left!

299
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,090
Don't worry.

300
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,230
No matter what kind of traps might spring up,
I'll slice through them with my sword.

301
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,300
Must be nice being as carefree as you.

302
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,270
This dungeon ain't nothin'!

303
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,820
I'm going to become the
Wizard King, after all.

304
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,260
Again with that?

305
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,130
I'm gonna become the Wizard King before Yuno.

306
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,200
Yuno?

307
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,880
Yeah. I haven't told you about him before?

308
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,970
He's a childhood friend
I grew up with in Hage Village.

309
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,580
We took the Magic Knights
Entrance Exam together,

310
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,410
and he got into the Golden Dawn.

311
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,650
That's amazing, isn't it?

312
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,420
He got into the Golden Dawn
without being a noble.

313
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,170
Yeah! He's amazing!

314
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,200
But I'm not gonna lose to him!

315
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,850
I guess even he has his own goal.

316
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,680
Come on. Let's go.

317
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,520
Looks like we can cross over there.

318
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,860
Let's hurry!

319
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,020
We're alone right now.

320
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,530
Silvantus... I mean, Nero's with us, but...

321
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,570
Something wrong?

322
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,210
It's nothing! Nothing at all!

323
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,080
Let's hurry.

324
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,100
A trap! Oh, no!

325
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,210
Noelle!

326
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,390
S-Such powerful magic...

327
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,030
Run!

328
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,240
Asta!

329
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,820
Oh, no!

330
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,920
Crap!

331
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,520
What the heck?

332
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,210
Such precise and powerful magic...

333
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,830
Who could it be?

334
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,100
Oh, come to think of it...

335
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,260
Apparently, a few from the Golden Dawn
have also been assigned to that dungeon.

336
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,590
Huh? The Golden Dawn?!

337
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,140
I wonder if they'll be able to get along.

338
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,610
Now...

339
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,280
I've repaid my debt,

340
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,280
Asta.

341
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,570
Yuno...

342
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

343
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,570
And push me forward

344
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,610
(I can't find a place to go)

345
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

346
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:50,390
And change the flow of time

347
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,810
(I will keep believing in you)

348
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,690
In this ever-vivid place

349
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,620
(Break free yourself)

350
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

351
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,190
If there is a path that I should choose

352
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

353
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,160
Wherever it may lead us

354
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,650
Until my life comes to an end

355
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

356
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

357
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

358
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

359
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

360
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,340
Petit Clover

361
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,810
Petit Clover!

362
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,840
What's Mana?

363
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,840
What's Mana?

364
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,400
Asta, do you know what mana is?

365
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,490
Yup!

366
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,140
Mana

367
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,140
It's written like this!

368
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,350
Mana

369
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,350
It's written with the same
character for "magic"!

370
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,580
Serious

371
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,190
These both mean "serious"!

372
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,820
Yes. Mana is a powerful energy
that exists in this world.

373
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,820
Yup! And everyone has it...

374
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,820
Except me!

375
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,450
Mages use up their mana to use magic.

376
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,430
That's why if they run out of it,

377
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,460
they might not be able to use
magic again until they recover.

378
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,960
Do you understand?

379
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,500
Yes!

380
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,020
What a lovely flower!

381
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,300
Perfect for giving to a girl.

382
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,340
Finral!

383
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,000
Wow, you're so aggressive!

384
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,880
I've never met a flower like you!

385
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,440
You've got really powerful magic, mister.

386
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,400
Let's fight with everything
we have, to the death.

387
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,910

"The Diamond Mage."

The Diamond Mage

389
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,740
Not giving up is my magic.
