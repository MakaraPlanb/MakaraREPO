1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,680
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,170
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,930
The Clover Kingdom's royal capital
suddenly fell under attack.

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,680
Flames rose in five spots
throughout the capital,

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,310
and the Magic Knights deployed to each
location to help the panicked citizens.

7
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,610
They battled an unknown enemy.

8
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,940
Come at me yourself!

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,740
Don't get cocky, you little brat!

10
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,870
Come forth, Alfred.

11
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,580
Number Two, Alfred.

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,930
Go, Alfred!

13
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,700
I would always close my eyes

14
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,040
And cower at reality

15
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,710
I can't stand the idea

16
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,090
Of just making excuses to give up

17
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,200
Stand right there

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
I don't want to be near you

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,540
Any minute now

20
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,880
Just wait right there

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,880
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,970
Black and blue

23
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,890
I'll give up on giving up

24
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,410
And get the world on my side

25
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

26
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,280
Every time somewhere under this sky

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,180
Break through the tearful nights

28
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,420
And head where the light shines

29
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,250
I want to keep my promise

30
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,800
I'll deliver it to you

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,820
shape of love

32
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,520
The Crimson Lion King

33
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,570
Central District

34
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,070
Something's wrong.

35
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,290
Their numbers are great,
but they're far too weak.

36
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,290
What does the enemy want?

37
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,080
Where is their main force?

38
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,250
What are they after?

39
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,330
The king?

40
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,010
Where is the Wizard King?

41
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,580
During an emergency like this,

42
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,500
he should be the first to rush to the side of

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,460
King of the Clover Kingdom
Augustus Kira Clover XIII

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,770
Augustus Kira Clover XIII,
King of the Clover Kingdom.

45
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,700
His first priority should be
to protect me. That is...

46
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,060
the most important duty of

47
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,870
the most powerful mage in
the kingdom,the Wizard King!

48
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,710
You are absolutely right, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,970
Rest assured, we, the advisors of
the Wizard King, will protect you.

50
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,410
Curse that Julius.

51
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,110
He's gotten full of himself because his
authority equals mine when we're at war,

52
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,270
hasn't he?

53
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,750
Honestly...

54
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:21,780
I'm the only leader of the Clover Kingdom!

55
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,120
Castle Town Kikka

56
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,780
Chef! What are you doing?

57
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,250
The royal capital is under attack!
We need to take shelter!

58
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,250
You idiots! Like a true chef could
leave in the middle of cooking!

59
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,530
I will deliver the best dishes,
no matter the situation!

60
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,260
That's what it means to be the best!

61
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,910
Uh, but all the Magic Knights have
been deployed, so there's no one here!

62
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,530
They left for battle.

63
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,010
What?! How could they have left
without eating my main dish?!

64
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,980
Well, our kingdom is in trouble!

65
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,830
Let's hurry and escape!

66
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,280
La!

67
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,530
Wh-Who's this little shrimp?

68
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,950
This main dish you mentioned...

69
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,410
Please let me eat it!

70
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,170
A Magic Knight's robe...

71
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,960
Which means she must be one
of the big shots that got

72
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,500
invited to the decoration ceremony.

73
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,880
And...

74
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,570
Her glaring eyes are practically on fire.

75
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,220
Her glaring drool is practically on fire.

76
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,730
She's...

77
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,020
someone special!

78
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,770
All right, you've got it!

79
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,690
Just wait!

80
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,470
I'll cook you up the best main dish ever!

81
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,060
What?!

82
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,240
Yay! Woohoo!

83
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,240
Let's just run!

84
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,280
Cooking...

85
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,040
is more important than my life!

86
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,040
Yay!

87
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,390
North District

88
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,000
Too bad, you stupid brat!

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,140
Your special anti-magic blade doesn't
mean anything if it can't hit its target!

90
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,570
Mister...

91
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,320
This is your chance!

92
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,650
Run!

93
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,430
O-Okay.

94
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,660
Please help him.

95
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,500
I know. Don't worry, he's...

96
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,170
a dear friend of mine!

97
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,050
Okay!

98
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,110
Come down here!

99
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,000
Are you stupid?

100
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,170
Who the heck would come down
just because someone told them to?

101
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,740
Back at the dungeon...

102
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,980
Yeah, leave it to me.

103
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,500
I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,830
I don't have any magic,

105
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,370
but I've got...

106
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,150
my friends!

107
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,250
My magical powers combined with Asta's sword.

108
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,970
If only I could help him now like I did then,

109
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,760
even if the enemy is in the air...

110
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,260
Black Bulls girl!

111
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,100
I, Leopold Vermillion, shall assist you.

112
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,890
I shall not let him harm my rival any longer!

113
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,110
Right.

114
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,370
You two can deal with him!

115
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,860
Muddy Water Magic...
Mine's a poor match for that.

116
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,630
Asta...

117
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,830
His wound from that attack earlier...

118
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,520
You told me earlier, didn't you?

119
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,110
To come at you myself?

120
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,200
You fool!

121
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm not going to fight. I'm going to control
my corpses and enjoy the show!

122
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,410
I'm going to win just by watching.

123
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,470
That's how I fight!

124
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,930
Unlike a meathead like you,
I actually know how to use my brain.

125
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,890
Moron!

126
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,850
Moron!

127
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,350
Damn it...

128
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,390
That stupid jerk doesn't even
think of people as people...

129
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,390
I don't wanna lose to him!

130
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,900
What's that look for?

131
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,930
Guts alone won't gonna get you
out of this, you stupid brat!

132
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,990
Alfred!

133
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,890
Asta!

134
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,290
Damn it! What should I...

135
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,300
Kill him!

136
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:01,260
M-My Alfred... turned into
charcoal in an instant...

137
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,540
He's...

138
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,650
Damn it... I couldn't defeat him on my own.

139
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,520
I apologize for horning in on your fight.

140
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,140
But I thought it would be a shame
to let a man like you die here.

141
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Forgive me.

142
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,040
You fought well for a peasant
with no magical powers.

143
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
You're funny, kid.

144
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,960
Join my squad.

145
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,630
I hate to admit this, but it looks like
Yami's foresight was better than mine.

146
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,060
Asta, wasn't it?

147
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,670
You mentioned that you were going to
become the Wizard King, didn't you?

148
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,160
Huh?! Become the Wizard King?!

149
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,740
There's no way a stupid brat like you who's
way weaker than me could become that!

150
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,120
Then...

151
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,790
I guess you're my rival, too.

152
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,770
So you're gonna fight me?

153
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,050
Finally, someone worth fighting...

154
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,340
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,

155
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,330
Fuegoleon Vermillion!

156
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,270
Asta,

157
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,590
leave the rest to me!

158
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,400
Asta!

159
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,690
Fuegoleon!

160
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,970
A captain of a Magic Knights squad...

161
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,570
I guess you're my rival, too.

162
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,710
Did he just say...

163
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,260
This is no time for me to be a wuss!

164
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,940
I can still...

165
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,210
do this!

166
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,380
No, you can't.

167
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,370
My head, my face, and my stomach hurt!

168
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm sure they do.

169
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,530
As a warrior, you need to constantly
be aware of your condition,

170
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,650
and determine if you're
able to fight or not.

171
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,030
You are definitely not
in that state right now.

172
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,270
Your exuberance may be your greatest
weapon, but keep a cool head, too.

173
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,380
If you truly wish to become
the Wizard King, that is.

174
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,280
Now, let's hear it.

175
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,540
What are you after?

176
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,880
Your actions are too scattered
for an invasion and

177
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,790
too organized for indiscriminate terrorism.

178
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,860
Who are you?

179
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,800
Who am I? You don't recognize me?

180
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,230
I guess I'm the only one
enjoying this reunion.

181
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,510
What?

182
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,650
Six years ago, I was the top choice
for a Magic Knights squad.

183
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,150
What? You're a former Magic Knight?

184
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,440
I guess you wouldn't remember.

185
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,690
I wasn't important enough for
you people to bother with.

186
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,040
He's a commoner, but he has
tremendous magical powers.

187
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,030
All who wish to offer,
please raise your hand.

188
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,190
I see... You're from back then.

189
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,850
What's your name?

190
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,320
It's Rades!

191
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,870
That's right.

192
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,540
I believe you joined the Purple Orcas.

193
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,470
They expelled me!

194
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,480
Expelled?

195
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,020
Rades, with all of your talent... Why?

196
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,160
They said that my magic was
dangerous and forbidden,

197
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,660
and kicked me out of the
squad and the kingdom both!

198
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,920
Because I was a commoner,
no one stood up for me. No one!

199
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,300
Even though my powers were
better than everyone else's!

200
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,380
Greater than the nobles'...
greater than anyone's!

201
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,750
I thought magic meant
everything in this kingdom!

202
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,760
And that's why!

203
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,100
I'm getting my revenge on the
Magic Knights and this country!

204
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,230
With my powers! That's what I'm after!

205
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,990
Though we do have another goal.

206
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,030
For such a childish reason...

207
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,280
You can't be serious, you fool!

208
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,490
Childish?

209
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,710
Reasons are always simple!

210
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,530
Leo!

211
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,090
Fuegoleon?

212
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,550
Do you need help?

213
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,430
Definitely not!

214
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,780
Not at all!

215
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,820
Hey...

216
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,460
Very good!

217
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,430
Wha—

218
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,500
If you understand, take care
of things quickly!

219
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,440
Yes, sir!

220
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,990
Wh-Whoa, those brothers are Spartan for sure!

221
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,340
Way to ask the impossible!

222
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,710
Our attributes are lousy against each other.

223
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,620
Not like I'm going to let you help him, but...

224
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,960
Sorry, but I can't control
the intensity of the flames.

225
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,460
Flame Creation Magic: Leo Rugiens!

226
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,350
A magical barrier...

227
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,940
Number One, Carl!

228
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,330
When he was alive, he was
an expert at defense magic!

229
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,700
So I added my curse magic
and made him even tougher!

230
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,990
He's bringing out one of those things again!

231
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,510
Asta.

232
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,450
Y-Yes, sir!

233
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,420
Do you remember what I said a moment ago?

234
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,460
Watch carefully.

235
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,330
Why are you so calm?!

236
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,470
Defense isn't the only thing he can do!

237
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,930
Flame Creation Magic: Ignis Columna.

238
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,690
Trying to match Carl's barrier spells, huh?

239
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,230
Well?!

240
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,200
What do you think about this invincible
barrier and super barrage?

241
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,200
Indeed, there is nothing I can do right now.

242
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,710
Is that all you've got,
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings?

243
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,230
Flame Magic: Sol Linea.

244
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,670
In the instant you attack,

245
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,710
for just a moment, the mana of
the barrier thins in places.

246
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,950
That's what I aimed for.

247
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,380
I deal with difficult magic every day.

248
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,910
Listen well, all of you!

249
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,120
As long as you are Magic Knights,

250
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,130
you will find yourselves constantly pitted
against powerful enemies and magic!

251
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,070
But when that happens,
if you gauge the ability calmly

252
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,140
and maintain a bold fighting spirit,
you will never lose!

253
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,590
Is that clear?!

254
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,720
Yes, sir!

255
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,140
He instantly saw his opponent's weaknesses,

256
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,640
and even psyched up his allies.

257
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,090
So that's a Magic Knights Captain.

258
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,150
H-He's awesome!

259
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:01,450
I-Impossible! My Number One
was defeated so easily...

260
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,290
D-Damn it! Damn it!

261
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,050
Rades, wasn't it?

262
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,630
Even if you possess extraordinary abilities
and polish them to their fullest,

263
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,130
without a righteous spirit,
your deeds are nothing but violence!

264
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,140
No one will acknowledge something like that.

265
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,310
I have a report, Your Majesty.

266
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,050
Most of the attackers have
been dealt with, it seems.

267
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,670
Took them long enough.

268
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,170
The Magic Knights need to work harder.

269
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,270
And? Where's the Wizard King?

270
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,160
Why hasn't he come to my side?

271
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,370
He's on an important mission.

272
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:55,170
Honestly... There's no way it
could be more important than me.

273
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,360
West District

274
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,500
What were those things, anyway?

275
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,340
Regardless, they're apparently
no match for us.

276
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,540
East District

277
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,220
I can't believe you fools
tried to attack my sis!

278
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,070
Only the women of the Blue Rose
Knights are allowed to touch her!

279
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,520
Sol, don't say things
people will misinterpret.

280
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,370
The only ones who can touch
Sis's soft, velvety skin are...

281
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,730
That's not what I meant.

282
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,430
Central District

283
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,430
What? Finished already?

284
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,650
But I wasn't done playing.

285
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,420
Something is off.

286
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,660
Northwest District

287
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,660
I guess that's most of them.

288
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,680
Th-They were so gross.

289
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,820
I need to get stronger so things like
this don't trouble me so much.

290
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,710
Th-They're so strong!

291
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,910
Hooray for the Magic Knights!

292
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:07,740
Hooray! Hooray!

293
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,270
It's too early for you to
be cheering just yet.

294
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,740
I think everything's about ready.

295
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,240
Now for some lively sow's mana...

296
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,060
How exciting!

297
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

298
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,570
And push me forward

299
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,610
(I can't find a place to go)

300
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

301
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:55,390
And change the flow of time

302
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,810
(I will keep believing in you)

303
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,690
In this ever-vivid place

304
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,630
(Break free yourself)

305
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

306
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,190
If there is a path that I should choose

307
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

308
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,160
Wherever it may lead us

309
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,650
Until my life comes to an end

310
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

311
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

312
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

313
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

314
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

315
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,340
Petit Clover

316
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,740
Petit Clover!

317
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,850
Palace Three-Second Cooking

318
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,230
Palace Three-Second Cooking.

319
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,220
The time where I, the royal
head chef of Clover Kingdom,

320
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,710
introduce a three-second dish
that anyone can make.

321
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,850
Today, I'd like to make some
curry in three seconds.

322
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,630
I'm going to be using simple curry
roux procured at the market.

323
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,230
Next, you'll need carrots, onions, potatoes,

324
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,820
some mushrooms, and maybe some tomatoes.

325
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,380
If you try adding secret ingredients
like chocolate or coffee,

326
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,380
you can make an even more fragrant curry.

327
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,090
Now, then... You take
those ingredients, and...

328
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,310
Immediately chop them up using
your magic, and simmer them!

329
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,860
Make sure you use plenty of love and passion!

330
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,880
And it's finished. Wasn't that easy?

331
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,940
Time to eat!

332
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,140
So good!

333
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,030
And that concludes this episode of Palace
Three-Second Cooking, dishes anyone can make!

334
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,730
See you next time!

335
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,110
But that's impossible!

336
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,400
Magic Knights, hurry up and
take care of the attackers.

337
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,400
Black Clover, Page 24: "Blackout."

338
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:55,250
Page 24
Blackout

339
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,700
Eating and napping is the job of
the King of Clover Kingdom,

340
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,740
Augustus Kira Clover XIII.
