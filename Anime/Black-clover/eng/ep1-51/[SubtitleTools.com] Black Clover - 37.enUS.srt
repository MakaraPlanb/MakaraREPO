1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,220
Looks like his own ultimate
spell did a number on him, too.

5
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,990
Asta and the others were
able to defeat the leader

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,600
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,860
But it was then that the strongest
three in the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,810
the Third Eye, showed up.

9
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,610
Well, this definitely doesn't look good.

10
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,320
How dare you insects do
that to my comrades?

11
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,950
I hate those who have hurt Licht.

12
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,500
Raia the Disloyal, Vetto the Despair,
and Fana the Hateful.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,170
I have nothing to worry about,
now that you're here.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,880
Faced with the trio's far superior strength,
the situation looked dire.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,480
I think it's about time we end this.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,680
Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,760
But then, the captain of the Green
Praying Mantises, Jack the Ripper;

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,600
the captain of the Blue Rose
Knights, Charlotte Roselei;

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,310
and the captain of the Silver
Eagles, Nozel Silva, arrived.

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,370
Looks like you're having fun, Yami.

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,790
The One With No Magic

22
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,710
I'm so glad you're safe.

23
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,710
And then Baro turned into mud.

24
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,720
So in the end, you two were being used
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun, too?

25
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,600
But it's true that my brother and I
kidnapped the children and stole their magic.

26
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,570
So I plan to atone for both
my sins and my brother's.

27
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,020
I'll turn myself in to the Magic Knights.

28
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,520
Then Asta...

29
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,820
He told me...

30
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,210
Yeah. And when you're done
with that, let's be buddies.

31
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,320
You can use really cool magic,
so you'd be really popular!

32
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,260
Just like that.

33
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,290
I'm very sorry.

34
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,490
There's no point in apologizing to me.

35
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,890
You're going to be his friend

36
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,250
as soon as you atone for your crimes, right?

37
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,930
Then you also need to pray
for Asta's safe return.

38
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,720
Right.

39
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,570
Asta, what are you doing?

40
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,230
Hurry up and come back.

41
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,020
Asta, please be safe.

42
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,590
I-It's not like I care what
happens to Stupidsta.

43
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,950
I don't care at all!

44
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,420
Why does this keep happening lately?!

45
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,170
Also, who am I making excuses to?!

46
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,170
I see. So she also...

47
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,580
I wonder if she's the one
Asta gave his heart to.

48
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,590
There's no way he'd give me the time
of day with someone like her around.

49
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,830
No, I shouldn't be thinking
about that right now.

50
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,240
I have to do everything I can for
when Asta and the others come back.

51
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Okay!

52
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,770
Reinforcements, eh?

53
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,650
Hey, no fair, Yami. You were hogging these
fun-looking enemies all to yourself.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,400
Well? Are they worth slicing up?

55
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,880
Nope, not at all.

56
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,050
They're pretty much like paper.

57
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,450
I was just about to finish them
off when you butted in, you jerk.

58
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,010
Yeah, right. Look how beat up you are.

59
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,210
Beat up? Who are you talking about?

60
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,010
Actually, why don't I use this
opportunity to slice you up, too?

61
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,480
Vent all of my past grudges.

62
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,600
And there he goes. What an idiot.

63
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,610
I'm sorry. Please spare me.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,310
You moron. Like I actually would.

65
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,840
I'll only do it when you're in tip-top shape.

66
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,110
Otherwise, there's no point.

67
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,840
How long are you just going to sit there?

68
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,080
You're so pathetic for a man.

69
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,830
You idiot. The ground just loves me
so much, it won't let my ass go.

70
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,210
You're the idiot.

71
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,970
There's no way the ground
would love an outlaw like you.

72
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,670
Talk about harsh. You're never going to find
a guy who'll marry you with that attitude.

73
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,880
Yikes.

74
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,610
I don't need to marry anyone!

75
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,390
The battlefield is my partner!

76
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,480
The battlefield's your partner? That's sad.

77
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,180
Why did I insult him again?

78
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,240
More importantly, how did I
fall for someone like that?

79
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,950
Even so, I just can't get him out of my head.

80
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,700
I can't just come out and
say that I l-like him now.

81
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,580
Besides, what would my
knights say about that?

82
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,590
Are you serious, Sis?!

83
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,810
He's a man! Seriously?!

84
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,470
What am I thinking?
Now's not the time for this.

85
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,780
The Eye of the Midnight Sun...

86
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,470
Its leader and top brass...

87
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,480
The top brass of the traitors who
attacked our country are all in a row.

88
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,620
What a perfect opportunity.

89
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,640
I'll bury them with my own hands.

90
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,900
Wow, you're so cool.

91
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,840
Begone from my sight, foreigner.

92
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,710
Thanks for your consideration,
Mr. Ball o' Pride.

93
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,790
Hey, I wonder how he gets his hair like that.

94
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,140
Huh? Doesn't he just get one of his
servants to do it, since he's royalty?

95
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,370
I'm sure he's got his own hair stylist.

96
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,130
He actually has someone do
it for him? But it's so lame!

97
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,880
Wait, so he does that braid himself?

98
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,930
That's pretty gross, too.

99
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,380
Shall I bury you lot first?

100
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,730
Nah, don't waste your magic on a foreigner.

101
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,400
I shall not hold back.

102
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,850
I'm getting fired up!

103
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,110
I can still fight, too!

104
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,870
Stay out of this, pond scum.

105
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,910
When the captains are on the battlefield,

106
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,330
mediocre combatants will only slow us down.

107
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,890
Especially a lowly peasant
with no magic like yourself.

108
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,890
Very well! True despair lies at
the end of an endless battle!

109
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,840
And the despair of the strongest
fighters is the ultimate spice!

110
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,100
What the hell is he talking about?

111
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,720
We're hunting some rats. Let's go.

112
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,790
You seem pretty excited, Vetto. What a pain.

113
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,260
Well, whatever.

114
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,490
I guess I'll do my best for Licht.

115
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,620
Right, so I call dibs on that pretty lady!

116
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,290
If I win, we're going drinking together!

117
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,970
If you win?

118
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,040
In that case, we'll never
raise glasses together.

119
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,550
Briar Creation Magic:
Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees!

120
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,090
There!

121
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,820
Whoa!

122
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,540
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

123
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,780
You get to fight me, big guy!

124
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,920
Oh? The Praying Mantis knight.

125
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,120
You dare fight me, insect?

126
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,370
Don't underestimate insects!

127
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,470
You're just a praying mantis!

128
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,880
I'll tear off your limbs and
wings while you're still alive!

129
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Bear Claw!

130
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,170
The one I have business with is you.

131
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,930
Mercury Magic: Silver Spears!

132
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,860
You want to hurt Licht, too?

133
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,650
I hate you. Die.

134
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,140
Her flames melted your mercury!

135
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,010
Want me to switch with you, Sparkles?

136
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,170
Shut your mouth.

137
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,960
As if flames like those could hurt me.

138
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,330
Just who do you think I
spent years competing with?!

139
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,240
What?!

140
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,000
What is this?

141
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,200
They're practically a natural disaster!

142
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,820
I can't see through all this dust!

143
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,190
Wow, they're working hard.

144
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,810
Hey, that's cutting it a little close, Jack.

145
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,660
Not bad, Charlotte.

146
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm surprised Nozel's braid stays in place.

147
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,670
You can see them?

148
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,390
I'm using ki. Try it,
even if you can't see them.

149
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,970
Hey, Finral.

150
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,300
Yes, sir?

151
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,940
You've recovered enough spatial magic
for one trip, haven't you?

152
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,440
We're going home? Yes, let's!

153
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,550
Let's let them handle this and—

154
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,070
True, Magic Knights captains are strong.

155
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,740
But they cannot defeat the Third Eye...

156
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,960
Because we are loved by mana.

157
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,460
So...

158
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,080
This must be some kind of mistake.

159
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,030
For that mere human with no magical
powers, who isn't loved by mana,

160
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,550
to have that grimoire...

161
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,600
I must hurry and retrieve it.

162
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,520
I finally weakened him this much.
There's no way I'm letting him go!

163
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,400
I figured you'd try that!

164
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,780
He's countering? Not good!

165
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,810
Yami!

166
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,940
Oh, dear. Looks like you
underestimated our boss too much.

167
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,740
Farewell.

168
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,680
Licht...

169
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,620
You're after the leader's head, too, right?

170
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,130
Go on. Go!

171
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,120
Wha—

172
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,460
What's he doing there?!

173
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,720
How did he get through the
smoke from this melee?

174
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,220
If you can read ki, it ain't impossible.

175
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,970
We didn't notice. None of us did.

176
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,830
We couldn't sense him.

177
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,210
Because he has... no magic!

178
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,230
Not giving up...

179
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,230
Thanks for believing I'd take a shot at you.

180
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,240
I believed in our no-magic idiot!

181
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,120
...is my magic!

182
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,840
How'd you like that? No magic in that attack!

183
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,720
Same with my attack.

184
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,580
Captain!

185
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,640
You surpassed your limits, kid.

186
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,190
Right!

187
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,490
Licht!

188
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,400
Licht!

189
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,110
You've got some nerve, looking away!

190
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,740
That shrimp got us.

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,950
He totally stole the glory!

192
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,220
We cannot fall behind.

193
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,210
Let's finish off the rest of them!

194
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,710
Yami!

195
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,140
There won't be any other
reinforcements, will there?

196
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,540
Badump, badump.

197
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,550
What? No way!

198
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,850
Let's finish him off while
the others are being held up!

199
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,840
Yeah.

200
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,750
What...

201
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,100
What is that?

202
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,930
Crap!

203
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,300
Because of that brat's anti-magic attack,

204
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,860
the sealing magic on Licht has been broken!

205
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,320
Crap.

206
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,570
That power's being held back
for the day that's to come...

207
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,830
Why?

208
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,620
Why do you have that grimoire?

209
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,890
Why do you...

210
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,920
have the Demon-Slayer Sword
and the Demon-Dweller Sword?

211
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,550
What's he talking about?

212
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,260
Those swords belong to the master!

213
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,930
"The master"?

214
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,410
According to our intel,

215
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,900
"the master" should refer to the leader
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

216
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,400
Does this mean it's not him?

217
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,130
All this about getting something back,
or something belonging to the master...

218
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,930
What the heck are you even talking about?

219
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,410
This crappy grimoire and these
crappy swords belong to me!

220
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,750
Stop making false accusations,
you crazy bastard!

221
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,750
No... Give them back.

222
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,880
That grimoire is...

223
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,050
Our master's grimoire and swords...

224
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,220
What?!

225
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,000
Captain!

226
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:20,520
A human like you shouldn't have them.

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,390
Well, this isn't good.

228
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,770
Bring it on!

229
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,250
Death Scythe!

230
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:27,030
Why? I need to get them back.

231
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,030
It swallowed up my severing magic!

232
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,240
Such an incredible concentration of magic!

233
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,700
If he actually releases that...

234
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,360
He'll blow this whole area away!

235
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,080
Even we won't be able to stop that!

236
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,570
What is this magic?

237
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,290
We're finished. His power was
actually restricted before?

238
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,510
I knew I shouldn't have come!

239
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,660
Actually, I wish I'd never
even joined this squad!

240
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,010
Hey, quit your complaining.

241
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,770
This is actually our chance.

242
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,770
If we defeat him and this power,
we'll leave our limits in the dust!

243
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,440
All right!

244
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,060
No way! You guys are nuts!

245
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,200
Hey! Don't you dare give up, Finral!

246
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,870
I have seniority here!

247
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,660
I'm not completely recovered yet.

248
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,000
Can I reflect it with my remaining magic?

249
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,160
Sorry, pretty lady.

250
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,750
We'll have to finish this next time.

251
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,510
If this keeps up, you won't last, Licht!

252
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,010
Trinity Sealing Magic!

253
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,560
They're actually trying to seal that?

254
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,250
That magic...

255
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,280
Damn...

256
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,410
You worked a little too hard there, Licht.

257
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,700
Get some rest.

258
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,550
He's okay.

259
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,910
Damn it.

260
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,960
Let's go, Vallie.

261
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,430
Our boss isn't feeling too good,
so we're gonna head home for today.

262
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:24,180
We lost this time. But the next time we
meet, I'll show you what true despair is!

263
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,950
Rodents will fall prey to the carnivores.

264
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,440
And that will be the end of you.

265
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,090
We, the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
are always watching you.

266
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,460
Such an unbelievable amount of magic...
and they were easily able to seal it.

267
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,960
They weren't giving their all.

268
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,020
Not only do they all possess
a great amount of mana,

269
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,280
but their control of natural
mana was on another level.

270
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,970
Looks like they're loved by mana.

271
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,760
They're definitely worth slicing up.

272
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,230
They got away.

273
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,800
But I will be the one to avenge you.

274
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,270
No matter what!

275
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,280
D-Did we win?

276
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,110
I'm not sure if we actually won or
if it's more like they ran away.

277
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,890
Pretty sure we can say
we won if they ran away.

278
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,850
They did say they lost.

279
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,700
A-All right!

280
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,690
We did it, Finral! Gauche!

281
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,770
Yeah! We did it!

282
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,300
You didn't do a thing.

283
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,100
Hey!

284
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,090
All right! We did it! We did it!

285
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,370
So, Yami... Don't you have something to say?

286
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,470
Man, I'm starving.

287
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,970
Not that. How about thanking us, huh?

288
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,180
What would've happened if we hadn't shown up?

289
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,490
I wouldn't have let them escape like you
did, and I would've defeated them all.

290
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,120
And I told you, that's not possible.

291
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,700
What a pathetic man you are.

292
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,370
I can't believe that lot
gave you so much trouble.

293
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,750
Jeez. Harsh as usual.

294
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,350
Amazing... I can't believe he was
actually fighting those three alone.

295
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,750
I guess it's no wonder
that I f-fell for him.

296
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,240
If you don't learn to be a little nicer,
you're going to be single forever.

297
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,760
I told you, I don't care!

298
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,230
My partner is the battlefield!

299
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,130
You should just worry about your partner!

300
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,830
If we're both still single when we're old,
wanna take care of each other?

301
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,110
Wha—You can't be serious!
I wouldn't be caught dead with you!

302
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,070
Why can't I ever just be honest?!

303
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,880
Asta!

304
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,860
Yeah, I'm not surprised he hit his limit.

305
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,220
Oh, well. Go get him fixed up, Finral.

306
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,100
Me?!

307
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,670
You need to be of some use.

308
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,070
I'm pretty sure I've been
useful this whole time!

309
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,130
Tch.

310
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,670
Really?!

311
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,610
The Black Bulls... Asta, eh?

312
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,800
Licht pushed himself a
little too far this time.

313
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,930
Well, he can rest now.

314
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,970
Licht...

315
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,630
What the hell? You're shaming
the name of the Third Eye.

316
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,070
What did you say?

317
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,490
Er... So what do we do now?

318
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,450
Now that Licht's identity is known,

319
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,250
the Wizard King's bound to put
everything into this investigation.

320
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,110
Geork and Catherine are still
being held captive, too.

321
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,880
If they get anything out
of them, this place...

322
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,670
and Licht's true identity will...

323
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,410
Well, Rades is right.

324
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,430
It's a bit early.

325
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,950
It wouldn't be good if they
found things out this early.

326
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,910
Hmm... What to do?

327
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,830
Oh, well. I'd rather not go,
but I don't think I have a choice.

328
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,420
Petit Clover

329
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,130
Petit Clover!

330
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,880
Sis Is Being Weird

331
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,580
Sis Is Being Weird.

332
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,620
Honestly, why have I fallen
for that overbearing,

333
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,630
crude man who doesn't even
look like he's twenty-eight?!

334
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,360
I want to embrace him... with my briars.

335
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,270
Yami!

336
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,890
What was that about Captain Yami, Sis?

337
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,780
N-Nothing at all!

338
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,030
Don't call me "Captain"! Call me "Sis"!

339
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,070
Wait, that's backwards.

340
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,070
I thought I heard something about briars.

341
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,130
Briars? Yes, briars!

342
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,870
I was thinking about how I wanted
to bind that Yami tightly with my briars!

343
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,340
Oh, I see! You want to torment him, right?

344
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:23,190
Man, you must really hate Captain Yami, Sis!

345
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,770
Y-Yes! I absolutely despise that man!

346
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,780
Well, he is a man! Who'd want
to even see his face?

347
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,660
Yes... I don't want to see his face.

348
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,900
I want to beat him with my briar whip!

349
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,890
Why can't I be more honest?!

350
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,020
I hate you. How could you hurt Licht?

351
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,490
I will not forgive you, Magic Knights.
