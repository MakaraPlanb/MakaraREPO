1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,730
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,620
Flame Creation Magic: Leo Rugiens!

5
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,860
Is that all you've got,
Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings?

6
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,570
In the instant you attack,

7
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,170
for just a moment, the barrier's
mana thins in places.

8
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,380
That's what I aimed for.

9
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,800
H-He's awesome!

10
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,300
Rades, wasn't it?

11
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,770
Even if you possess extraordinary abilities
and polish them to their fullest,

12
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,270
without a righteous spirit,
your deeds are nothing but violence!

13
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,150
No one will acknowledge something like that!

14
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,950
I need to get stronger so things like
this don't give me so much trouble.

15
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,610
It's too early for you to
be cheering just yet.

16
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,080
I think everything's just about ready.

17
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,580
Now for some lively sow's mana...

18
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,220
How exciting!

19
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,730
I would always close my eyes

20
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,070
And cower at reality

21
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,740
I can't stand the idea

22
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,120
Of just making excuses to give up

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,260
Stand right there

24
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,400
I don't want to be near you

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,540
Any minute now

26
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,920
Just wait right there

27
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,920
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,010
Black and blue

29
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,930
I'll give up on giving up

30
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,430
And get the world on my side

31
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

32
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,320
Every time somewhere under this sky

33
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,180
Break through the tearful nights

34
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,450
And head where the light shines

35
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,290
I want to keep my promise

36
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,830
I'll deliver it to you

37
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,820
shape of love

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,550
Blackout

39
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,430
Why?

40
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,310
I have magic that's stronger
than anyone else's.

41
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,980
I studied everything there was about my
magic, polished my skills, and prepared!

42
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,320
All for this day!

43
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,870
For years... and years!

44
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,140
And yet... Why?!

45
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,060
Noelle, I thank you!

46
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,440
You can save the thanks! Just hurry up!

47
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,190
But of course!

48
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,940
Flame Magic: Ignis Columna!

49
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,220
How'd you like that?! I made him
evaporate with intense firepower!

50
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,930
Ow...

51
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,250
Excellent! Well done!

52
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,940
You are definitely a man worthy
of leading this country!

53
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,440
Yes, sir!

54
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,940
I accidentally saluted, too.

55
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,240
I-Impossible...

56
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,810
Impossible! I've got as much magic as a royal!

57
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,710
I...

58
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,710
Flame-Binding Magic: Leo Palma!

59
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,420
L-Let go of me!

60
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,980
I'm still—

61
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,220
Damn it! Damn it!

62
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,730
At this rate, I...

63
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,730
There are many questions I'd like to ask you.

64
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,230
But before that, I will be
confiscating your grimoire.

65
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,440
Don't!

66
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,020
Don't touch my grimoire!

67
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,950
What is this grimoire?

68
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,580
S-Stop it!

69
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,340
There's only one page?

70
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,740
Don't! Don't look at it!

71
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,770
He can only use one spell?

72
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,170
Damn it!

73
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,950
Give it back!

74
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,180
Don't you dare look down on me!

75
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,510
Who's gonna look down on you?

76
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,570
Couldn't you think of any other way to get
people to acknowledge your power?

77
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:37,870
You have amazing magic, and you were
strong enough to claw your way up...

78
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,210
It's such a waste!

79
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,130
Here. I'll lend you my arm.

80
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,130
Thanks.

81
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,640
What you lacked to overcome adversity...

82
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,890
was a righteous heart.

83
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,650
Pay for your crimes.

84
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,650
Are you satisfied now?

85
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,280
A voice...

86
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,990
What's the matter?

87
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:14,130
It was impossible for you to beat
a captain on your own after all.

88
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,910
I-It's not impossible...

89
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,740
I...

90
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,710
The sheer volume of your magic isn't enough.

91
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,530
I'm also reaching my limit.

92
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,650
You're through acting on your own.

93
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,570
From now on, things are
going to go as planned.

94
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,430
All for our master.

95
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,930
West District

96
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,700
The Magic Knights are amazing!

97
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,980
Hooray for the Golden Dawn!

98
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,980
Now, then, I think I'll go have some dessert.

99
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,260
Would you like to join me?

100
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,900
I will decline.

101
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,430
East District

102
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,530
Thank goodness...

103
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,170
Let's go back to our lodgings and
wash off all this sweat, Sis.

104
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,210
Indeed.

105
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,000
Great job, Blue Rose Knights!

106
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,110
Lady Charlotte is so elegant.

107
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,290
Lady Charlotte is so lovely.

108
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,920
Sol is so cool!

109
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,680
Central District

110
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,900
What is their motive?

111
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,920
Northwest District

112
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,490
Looks like they're in the marked areas.

113
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,590
My grimoire...

114
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,920
What?

115
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,810
Well done, Magic Knights.

116
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,610
No—

117
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,480
Sis!

118
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,450
Wh-What the?

119
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,700
The Magic Knights...

120
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,210
Lady Charlotte... disappeared.

121
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,210
Sol...

122
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,830
Where are we?

123
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,150
It would appear that we're at least

124
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,110
a few hundred kilometers
away from the royal capital.

125
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,700
They got us! Damn it!

126
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,820
They managed to infiltrate the royal capital.

127
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,630
I figured they must've had a rather
skilled spatial magic user, but...

128
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,050
To think they were able
to send us all this far.

129
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,780
Curses!

130
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,510
What the...

131
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,990
The Magic Knights' mana...

132
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,970
I can't feel it anymore.

133
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,480
This is unprecedented spatial magic.
Was there another spellcaster?

134
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,250
Wh-What's going on?

135
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,240
I have no idea.

136
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,760
To think the great Magic Knights would
all fall for a silly trap like that.

137
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,500
How stupid can they be?

138
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,180
I was supposed to play with the stragglers,
but it looks like I won't have to bother.

139
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:06,520
Now, then... I'd better use this
time to get some nice, young mana.

140
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,340
Ash Curse Magic: Ash Absorbing Formation.

141
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,320
Wh-What the?

142
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,110
No! What's going on?

143
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,380
Excellent. Just look!

144
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,600
My skin is silky smooth.

145
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,620
Even water would bounce right off of it.

146
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,380
No! Save me!

147
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,760
Stop acting all cute, you sow!

148
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,100
Eliza! W-Wake up!

149
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,400
Well, aren't you a handsome young man?

150
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,590
Say, do you think I'm pretty?
How old do I look?

151
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,620
Well?

152
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,290
H-How could you? You monster!

153
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,260
Who are you calling a monster?! Die!

154
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,840
Oh, my.

155
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,760
I guess someone was able to
escape that spatial magic.

156
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:40,610
My, you're hot and my type.
Say, want to have some fun with me?

157
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,260
Get away from those people,

158
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,860
you old hag.

159
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,830
I'll murder you!

160
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:07,680
My, you're hot and my type.
Say, want to have some fun with me?

161
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,290
Get away from those people,

162
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,930
you old hag.

163
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,100
I'll murder you!

164
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,100
Who are you calling an old hag?!

165
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,490
Ash Curse Magic: Cheerful Ash Destruction.

166
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,360
These are curse bullets
with various curses inside.

167
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,290
You won't know what you'll
get until they hit.

168
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,050
Who are you people? What are you after?

169
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,470
My, my. Look at you,
with such ample time to talk.

170
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,050
Well, since you're hot,
I guess I'll tell you.

171
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,470
We're here to eliminate someone.
That's our goal.

172
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,100
Eliminate someone?

173
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,850
Who do you think it is, darling?

174
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,990
Well, I'm definitely not going to tell you.

175
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,270
You're working with at least one other.

176
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,870
A spatial magic user must have
infiltrated the royal capital.

177
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,370
Where are they?

178
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,130
Have they already fled?

179
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,750
No matter where you might've sent
the rest of the Magic Knights,

180
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,390
you don't have enough power
to take over the royal capital.

181
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,890
I can't imagine that this was
just to go after the king.

182
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,390
King's Quarters

183
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,970
You've made it clear that
your motive is revenge,

184
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,870
but what are you and the
others after overall?

185
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,910
Our true motive...

186
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,920
is you, Fuegoleon Vermillion!

187
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,380
What?

188
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,680
Fuegoleon!

189
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,430
What do you—

190
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,890
This is spatial magic.

191
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,690
Very well. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

192
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,390
Fuegoleon!

193
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,690
What is this place?

194
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,420
The attacks keep coming. She has
a tremendous amount of magic.

195
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,070
These ash bullets themselves
don't do much damage, but...

196
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,050
Oh, dear...

197
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,600
Are you all right? It looks like you're
having a hard time getting around.

198
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,000
I wonder what you've been hit with.

199
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,870
Damn it...

200
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,450
I... can barely see anymore.

201
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,010
I'm gradually losing sensation
throughout my body, too.

202
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,970
Hey, can you hear me? Hello?

203
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,020
My ears are also going... This is her power?

204
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,900
My Ash Curse Magic: Cheerful Ash
Destruction works very gradually.

205
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,460
First, your eyes stop
working, then your ears,

206
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,380
and then your body stops moving.

207
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,910
You'll pay for having the
insolence to call me an old hag.

208
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,490
People expected a lot
from my four-leaf clover...

209
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,460
I even joined the top Magic
Knights squad, the Golden Dawn.

210
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,880
Yet... what am I doing?

211
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,500
Who cares about a four-leaf clover?
That stupid peasant, getting a big head...

212
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,250
Hmph. He lacks the talent worthy to
be a member of the Golden Dawn.

213
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,890
I'm sure he won't last long.

214
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,650
All those voices around me don't matter.

215
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm only bettering myself so I won't lose. But...

216
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,570
I couldn't win.

217
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,720
What defeated that guy was
a power I just happened upon,

218
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,120
one that I can't control.

219
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,580
Not to mention...

220
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,750
That power doesn't seem
to want to listen to me.

221
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,260
The only reason I was able to
avoid the spatial magic earlier

222
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,100
was because something other
than my own power reacted.

223
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,060
It's not like we're expecting
anything from that peasant.

224
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,300
No, that's not it.

225
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,110
That's not why I'm frustrated.

226
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,950
Where are you attacking?

227
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,530
You have to aim properly, like this.

228
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:31,580
If you say, "I'm sorry, miss," and adorably
beg for your life, I'll forgive you.

229
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,130
Not a... chance...

230
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,030
I can't see... anything...

231
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,180
I can't feel... anything.

232
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,700
This is... the flow of mana?

233
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,060
It's said that mages with wind-based
mana are excellent at detecting mana.

234
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,230
With all five senses cut off

235
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,210
and his back against the wall,
Yuno's finely honed concentration

236
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,570
demonstrated an astonishing
ability to detect mana,

237
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,170
and was attempting to go beyond even that.

238
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,610
Come on, hurry up and beg for your life.

239
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,990
If you don't, I'm just
going to have to kill you.

240
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,020
There are so many things I want
to ask you. Hey, can you hear me?

241
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,570
Hey, come on. Answer me!

242
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,590
Would you shut up?

243
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,250
I couldn't care less about you.

244
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,080
I just...

245
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,040
don't want to lose...

246
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,330
to Asta!

247
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,170
Not yet!

248
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,850
That grimoire...
The legendary four-leaf clover?

249
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,360
Huh? Mana is gathering...

250
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,610
This sensation... He's...

251
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,040
He's controlling the mana?!

252
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,100
I see. The spirit has constantly
been sending me mana signs.

253
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,130
I was relying so much on my sight and
hearing that I wasn't noticing them.

254
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,890
Let me just tell you one thing about me.

255
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,570
I...

256
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,890
hate losing more than anything else!

257
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,400
Wind Spirit Magic: Sylph's Breath!

258
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,150
No! I have to use the magic
I stole to defend myself, or I'll—

259
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,410
You're...

260
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

261
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,570
And push me forward

262
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,610
(I can't find a place to go)

263
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

264
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:02,390
And change the flow of time

265
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,810
(I will keep believing in you)

266
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,690
In this ever-vivid place

267
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,640
(Break free yourself)

268
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

269
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,190
If there is a path that I should choose

270
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

271
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,160
Wherever it may lead us

272
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,650
Until my life comes to an end

273
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

274
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

275
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

276
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:38,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

277
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

278
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:57,350
Petit Clover

279
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,750
Petit Clover!

280
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,850
Birthday

281
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,140
Birthday.

282
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,110
I was able to get the wind
spirit to listen to me.

283
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,620
I shall name her Bell,
and today is Bell's birthday.

284
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,520
This cake is for you, Bell.

285
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,660
Yay!

286
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,110
Should we say you're one year old?

287
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,620
Happy birthday, Bell.

288
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,370
So pretty!

289
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,580
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

290
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,170
Um...

291
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,690
Huh? Where's the cake?

292
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,110
Not a chance...

293
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,940
You bastard! What did
you do with my brother?!

294
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,440
Answer wisely, or you shall face my wrath!

295
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,980
Fuegoleon! You... Fuegoleon!

296
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,530
Black Clover, Page 25: "Adversity."

297
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,000
Page 25
Adversity

298
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,820
I'm calm at all times...
