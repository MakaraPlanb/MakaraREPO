1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,640
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,970
How'd you like that?
Some lowly commoners just won.

5
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,220
How'd you like that, damn it?!

6
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,110
Asta!

7
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,320
Honestly, he's so ridiculous.

8
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,360
You finally awake, you jerk?

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,660
So my magic is sealed.

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,790
You're going to spill everything
to the Magic Knights,

11
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,730
including who you guys are
and what your motives are!

12
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,040
I refuse.

13
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,250
It appears the end has come.

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,940
Ice Magic: Ice Burial.

15
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,480
Talk about resolve.

16
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,150
You idiot!

17
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,860
What do...

18
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,860
What do you think life is?!

19
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,520
What Happened on a Certain
Day in the Castle Town

20
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,760
Grey words can't make anything happen

21
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,400
I know, yeah I know

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,680
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,650
I dreamed it all my life

24
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,420
Step by step I go, though
it's a doubtful world 

25
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,570
Don't care how much I fall

26
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,060
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

27
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,300
To faraway future, I burst out running

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,470
Go beyond even the unseen fears

29
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,850
The vision I had, so I can be myself

30
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,100
Someday I will write the next page

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,610
You are my hope

32
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,360
Like that page from someday

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,690
I was able to meet you

34
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,660
I call this a miracle

35
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Sounds like you guys went through hell!

36
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,610
Why does he sound so happy about that?

37
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,040
Someone even died.

38
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,010
Hey, Captain, I don't think
this is a laughing matter.

39
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,600
Being depressed isn't going to
bring Old Man Seihi back. Right?

40
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,270
Yes, sir! It's just as you say, sir.

41
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,990
Old Man Seihi liked to see
everyone happy and energetic.

42
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,290
Come on. You guys should be laughing, too.

43
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,030
Come on!

44
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,900
Louder!

45
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,670
You, too, Lady Noe!

46
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,250
That's how it should be.

47
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,130
What happened to
Old Man Seihi really is a shame,

48
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,990
but you three were able
to protect the villagers.

49
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,300
Be proud of that.

50
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,310
Well done. Great job, you idiots.

51
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,710
Yes, sir!

52
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,480
Thanks.

53
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,230
What's that?

54
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,330
You moron! You don't even know
the Magic Knights' salute?!

55
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,620
Take a good look!

56
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,370
These fingers symbolize the clover.

57
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,790
Go on, give it a try.

58
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,180
Yes, sir!

59
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,960
Well done!

60
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,710
We're back.

61
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,220
Great job, you three.

62
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,280
Miss Vanessa! Finral!

63
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,470
Captain, we went to the
Magic Investigation Department.

64
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,140
Good. Did you find anything out?

65
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,410
Who the heck's behind all this?!

66
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,450
I'll find their hideout and raid it!

67
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,460
I'll beat the crap out of
the guy who got away, too!

68
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,940
Well, you see,

69
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,450
they investigated the item he left behind,

70
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,620
but still don't have a clue.

71
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,950
How useless can they be?

72
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,540
You fools!

73
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,150
Stop breaking stuff!

74
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,010
Sorry!

75
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,420
But that pocket watch is pretty nice.

76
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,370
Yes, and from what you said
about how they were acting,

77
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,640
they were all of very high status.

78
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,670
So they're royalty or nobles.

79
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,060
Oh, who's this little guy? He's adorable.

80
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,780
How's it adorable?!

81
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,500
I-It is adorable!

82
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,520
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

83
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,570
Why, you little!

84
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,380
Hey, come here.

85
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,540
You ugly little bird!
I'll turn you into fried chicken!

86
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,170
I won't let you turn him into fried chicken!

87
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,700
Say your prayers!

88
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,090
Don't you dare!

89
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,370
Are you two trying to break the building?!

90
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,430
We're sorry!

91
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,680
You're the one breaking everything, though.

92
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,650
All right, listen up.

93
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,290
It doesn't matter if the ones behind
this are royalty or nobility.

94
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,310
We're going to let the
Investigation Department

95
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,440
take care of this,
and we'll wait for their report.

96
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,700
More importantly, I've got some good news.

97
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,970
Good news?

98
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,200
Wanna hear it?

99
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,040
Of course!

100
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,750
Your actions have been acknowledged
by the Wizard King himself!

101
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,750
The Wizard King?!

102
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,260
You've been given a star!

103
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,300
Whoa, seriously?!

104
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,450
All right!

105
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,780
Yeah!

106
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,890
Wow.

107
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,770
Heck yeah!

108
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,270
Congrats.

109
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,100
So, what are stars?

110
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,590
Don't get so excited if you
don't know what they are!

111
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,440
Stars are awarded by the Wizard
King based on our performance.

112
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,610
What are they good for?

113
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,580
Well... They're like an honor.

114
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,860
Honor?!

115
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,390
That's right, Asta! Honor!

116
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,410
It's a badge of honor for a man!

117
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,980
There's a lady here, too.

118
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,210
It's a badge of honor for a man and a woman!

119
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,840
That makes no sense.

120
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,840
The various Magic Knights squads
compete to get the most stars.

121
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,940
The number of stars indicates
how much work a squad has done.

122
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,350
I see!

123
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,550
Speaking of, the Golden Dawn is currently
at the top with seventy stars.

124
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,230
Seventy?!

125
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,830
What about us? How many
do the Black Bulls have?

126
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,190
We can't lose to the Golden Dawn!

127
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,200
We...

128
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,000
finally have a nice, even negative thirty.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,190
Negative?!

130
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,330
What?

131
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,870
We're finally only a hundred
away from the Golden Dawn.

132
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,110
A hundred?!

133
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,240
It's going to take forever to catch
up and beat them! Damn it, Yuno!

134
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,850
Not happening.

135
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,060
Should I really be in this squad?

136
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,150
One other thing.

137
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,780
Here's your pay for this month.

138
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,200
Huh?

139
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,950
It's money! There's at
least 200,000 yuls here!

140
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,740
Thanks!

141
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,540
Thanks, Captain! I'm going to eat
lots of yummy things with this!

142
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,520
Yeah, eat up.

143
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,450
Hey, Captain! How much would
it take for you to fight me?

144
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,780
Well? Well?

145
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,950
I won't.

146
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,550
Aw, come on!

147
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,980
I was thinking about buying new clothes
for my goddess, my little sister, Marie.

148
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,930
What do you think will look best on her?

149
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,180
Don't ask me.

150
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,600
No idea.

151
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,020
Tomorrow's gonna be a day off,
so don't let it go to waste.

152
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,910
I'm gonna go on tons of dates!

153
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,210
Do whatever you want.

154
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,020
Thanks!

155
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,220
Thank you for everything, Captain.

156
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,960
We should all go out somewhere and
have fun. What do you guys think?

157
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,820
This isn't much.

158
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,500
You moron!

159
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,810
You could buy at least ten years'
worth of tatoes with this money!

160
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,720
Tatoes? What are those?

161
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Potatoes from Hage Village that taste
bland and have a questionable texture.

162
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,010
That sounds awful.

163
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,910
They aren't! Sister Lily can
make anything taste good!

164
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,850
And who's that?

165
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,310
The woman I'm going to marry someday!

166
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,610
What?

167
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,730
But aren't sisters women of the cloth?
I don't think they can get married.

168
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,990
I-It'll work out somehow!
I'll go beyond all limitations!

169
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,450
Are you stupid?

170
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,230
Congrats on your first payday!

171
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,430
What do you plan to do with it?

172
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,250
I haven't decided.

173
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,070
What about you, little boy?

174
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,250
I-I'm going to send some money
back to the church in Hage.

175
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,970
That's a great idea, Asta!
That's the manly thing to do!

176
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,830
Right?! Do you send money back, too?

177
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,490
Of course I do! But...

178
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,890
But?

179
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,480
Only after I've increased it a hundredfold!

180
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,730
You never learn, do you?

181
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,820
A man's gotta take risks!

182
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,790
By "man," you must mean "moron."

183
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,130
Sending some money back is
fine, but don't send it all.

184
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,510
Use a little bit for yourself.

185
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,330
Sh-Should I?

186
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,450
But what should I use it for?

187
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,350
Let's go shopping in the
castle town tomorrow.

188
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,580
You, too.

189
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,750
Shopping?

190
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,050
I'll take you both.

191
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,690
Sister Lily, how are you doing?

192
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,670
I'm doing well.

193
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,150
All of the kind senior squad members
are taking good care of me.

194
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,940
Asta, stand right here.

195
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,540
What are we doing?

196
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,440
Don't move.

197
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,860
Flame Magic:

198
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,200
Exploding...

199
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,750
Fireball!

200
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,530
Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!

201
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,460
I told you not to move!

202
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,130
I didn't!

203
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,060
Also, I did really well on my first mission,

204
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,420
and received a star from the Wizard King
for my excellent performance.

205
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,160
At this rate, I might be able to
become the Wizard King by next month.

206
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,520
I want to become the Wizard King and make
this a world where everyone can be happy.

207
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,570
Then I'll come for you, so please marry me.

208
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,750
"Oh, I just had my first payday,
so I'm sending you the money."

209
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,740
I'm done!

210
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,290
This is an awesome letter,
if I do say so myself.

211
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,810
I wonder if Sister Lily
will be moved to tears.

212
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,590
The Wizard King...

213
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,130
The Wizard King, huh?

214
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,800
I wonder what he's like...

215
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,080
Have you ever been to the castle town?

216
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,370
I haven't.

217
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,910
I guess royals and nobles wouldn't
really have reason to go very often.

218
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,130
How about you, little boy?

219
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,280
I just passed through when I went to
take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

220
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,250
Then let's have a lot of fun today.

221
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,870
Hey, stop touching me.

222
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,730
I can't help it! Do you want me to fall?

223
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,430
I can't stop thinking about
him for some reason. Ugh...

224
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,900
Again?!

225
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,150
The Clover Kingdom is split between the
Noble Realm, where royalty and nobility live,

226
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:23,690
Saussy

227
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:23,690
Spade Kingdom

228
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:23,690
Forsaken Realm

229
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:23,690
Rayaka

230
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:23,690
Heart
Kingdom

231
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:23,690
Common Realm

232
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:23,690
Noble Realm

233
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:23,690
Diamond
Kingdom

234
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,850
the Common Realm, where the commoners live,

235
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,690
and the Forsaken Realm,
where the peasants live.

236
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,780
The Castle Town of Kikka,
where Asta and Yuno took

237
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,200
the Magic Knights Entrance Exam,
is in the Common Realm.

238
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,490
It's still amazing!

239
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,940
It's very lively.

240
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,540
I hope I can bring Sister Lily and the
kids from the church here someday.

241
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,930
What about me?!

242
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,580
Oh?

243
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,140
Marie, my goddess, I'll be there soon.

244
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,280
I want to see your smiling face as soon
as possible. I can't contain myself.

245
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,230
Mister!

246
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,420
That voice...

247
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,560
So you've come again.

248
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,340
I have.

249
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,810
I'm not going to lose this month!

250
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,270
I won't, either!

251
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,290
The ultra ultimate super
large serving of everything!

252
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,690
I dare you to eat all of it!

253
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,940
Thanks for the nummies!

254
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,620
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

255
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,950
I'm getting heartburn just watching her.

256
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,770
Do you have some time, miss?

257
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,540
Want to have some tea with me?

258
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,960
Do I look like I have time?

259
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,880
You can bring your kids along.
I know a great place—

260
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,810
You actually think they're my kids?!

261
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,590
They're my brother and sister!

262
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,050
I have to hurry home so we can open the shop.

263
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,940
I don't have any time to mess around.

264
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,610
Man, I love tough young ladies.

265
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,900
Miss, want to have some fun with me?

266
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,680
Don't get too far ahead, little boy.

267
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,110
I'm so excited!

268
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,110
Don't you two want to buy anything?

269
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,870
There are just so many things,
I don't know what to get.

270
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,750
I don't really...

271
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,540
Hey, those robes... They're Magic Knights.

272
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,120
That mark... Ugh, it's the Black Bulls!

273
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,430
That's the lush witch Vanessa.

274
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,250
Are the cute girl next to her and
the little kid also Black Bulls?

275
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,100
It's probably best to stay away.

276
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,700
They're starting to get a bit restless.

277
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:07,230
It's fine. Magic Knights being
in town helps deter crime.

278
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,060
Not to mention, some fine
gentlemen might approach us.

279
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,410
I've bought some healing herbs,

280
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,280
as well as some shique ointment,
which acts as a poison antidote.

281
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,750
That should do it.

282
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,690
I bought what I needed, so why don't
we go somewhere a bit more quiet?

283
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,960
Somewhere quiet?

284
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,700
I know just the place.

285
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,040
This way.

286
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,420
That way?

287
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,310
Isn't this just some alley?

288
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,860
It's a dead end.

289
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,050
Huh?!

290
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,590
Come now.

291
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,710
Whoa!

292
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,150
Black Market

293
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,830
This is the Black Market.

294
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,690
The Black Market?

295
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:17,260
It's a bit dangerous, but they have
some very effective magical items.

296
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,070
Hey, Vanessa. I got some good stuff in.

297
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,560
Hey! I'll take a look later.

298
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,190
Awesome!

299
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,620
Oh, you don't seem too excited.

300
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,800
Well, no.

301
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,620
I guess I can't blame you.

302
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,200
Royals and nobles won't set foot
in here because of their prejudices.

303
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,370
But you can't control your
magical powers yet, right?

304
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,190
Th-That's right. Why?

305
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,210
They have items that can help you
control your magical powers here.

306
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,970
If you can find an item that's a good
fit for you, and adjust your powers,

307
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,590
you might be able to control them.

308
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,970
Control my powers...

309
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,720
Why don't we take a look around?

310
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,850
S-Sure.

311
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,290
It's really lively over there.

312
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,730
You two are a bit too
young to go in there yet.

313
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,400
Amateurs shouldn't spend too much time
in there, or it could ruin their lives.

314
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,320
All right!

315
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,820
Let's do this! Let's do this!

316
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm going to make my paycheck
grow a hundredfold!

317
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,220
Hey, I know that guy!

318
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,460
Damn it, I lost again! Bah-ha...

319
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,460
I can see the future.

320
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,470
Bah-ha! That old lady's strong.

321
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,520
I really shouldn't be wasting time
here, anyway. I have work to do.

322
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,420
Well, the job's to catch a purse-snatcher.

323
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,490
Is that even a job for a Magic Knight?

324
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,530
Bah-ha...

325
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,450
But the captain would get
real scary if I refused.

326
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,290
You got a problem with that?
I'll slice you in two!

327
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,120
Bah-ha! I finally managed
to join the Magic Knights,

328
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,990
but it's the Green Praying Mantises.

329
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,880
I'm a praying mantis. A frickin' bug.

330
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,120
All I do every day is run errands.

331
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,550
When I finally got an actual mission,
I got used as bait and almost died.

332
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,350
I'm constipated and my hair's thinning.

333
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,540
Bah-ha, damn it.

334
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,310
Hey, she's cute!

335
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,360
What about this? You could probably
use this to stabilize your powers.

336
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,460
It looks so cheesy.

337
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,780
Well, just give it a try.

338
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,070
Bah-ha?!

339
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,340
You shouldn't have been walking there!

340
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,850
Bah-ha! Well, well,
what brings you two down here?

341
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:13,420
The Black Market is no place
for you lovely ladies. Bah-ha!

342
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,300
Did you get lost?

343
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,150
As an elite member of the Magic Knights,
I shall guide you out of here.

344
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,370
Get lost, you insect.

345
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Bah-ha...

346
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,160
Hey! I found something really cool!

347
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,870
You didn't actually buy that, did you?

348
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,490
It talks!

349
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,670
So you did.

350
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,560
Look!

351
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,430
We are hoomans.

352
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,250
See?

353
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,840
What, exactly?

354
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,600
Bah-ha!

355
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,450
Th-That's...

356
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,420
Huh? Hey, you're Bah-ha!

357
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,360
It's Sekke! Bah-ha!

358
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,230
How've you been, Bah-ha?

359
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,390
The name's Bah-ha! No, wait, Sekke!

360
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,170
Who's that?

361
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,730
I took the Entrance Exam with him.

362
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,650
Ah, you're a member of the
Green Praying Mantises.

363
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,600
He's with two beautiful girls?! Wait, no...

364
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,540
They're both members of
the Black Bulls, too.

365
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,340
Asta, you bastard!
You're making me jealous.

366
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:20,830
Besides, it's all your fault that
I ended up in the Green Praying Mantises.

367
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,670
Bah-ha! You infuriating bah-hastard!

368
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,190
Th-Thief!

369
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,940
My winnings! Stop!

370
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:58,980
No one can escape from here

371
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:05,500
Once again in the small closed off classroom

372
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:13,600
The star of the class was shining yet again

373
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:20,610
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

374
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,480
I've thought many times

375
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,150
That the revolution was within my hands

376
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:34,870
Isn't it strange? If you want
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

377
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:41,630
The rest of us who were left
behind wanted to become something

378
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:48,880
We repeat the same morning over and over

379
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,770
You're the only one who
can choose your tomorrow

380
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,660
Let's go beyond our current selves

381
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,290
Petit Clover

382
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,310
Petit Clover!

383
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,790
Sekke's Bah-Ha Seminar

384
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,180
Sekke's Bah-Ha Seminar!

385
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,290
Bah-ha!

386
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,050
Bah-ha.

387
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,540
Wrong! It's...

388
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,800
Bah-ha!

389
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,640
Bah-ha!

390
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,300
Asta, you have yet to learn
the ways of the bah-ha.

391
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,800
Bah-ha!

392
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,590
The ways of the bah-ha?!

393
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,150
Bah-ha! This is my chance
to make a name for myself!

394
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:46,180
I'm going to catch the thief and
get praise from the Wizard King, ha!

395
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,220
Black Clover, Page 12:
"The Wizard King Saw."

396
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:55,000
Page 10
The Wizard King Saw

397
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,700
Not giving up is my bah-ha!
