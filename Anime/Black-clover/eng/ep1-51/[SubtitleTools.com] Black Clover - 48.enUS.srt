1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,940
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,350
Vetto realized his true powers,
and they were unbelievably immense.

5
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,640
Asta used the last of his
strength and faced him.

6
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,110
Not giving up is my only weapon!

7
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,880
And I'm never going to give
up until I fulfill my wish!

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,510
No matter what!

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,340
His teammates were moved
by his words and actions!

10
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,000
You didn't give up, and that's why I'm here.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,660
My juniors are working hard.

12
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,040
That means I have to
act like a proper senior.

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,010
I swear that we won't let you die!

14
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,350
Let's go!

15
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,480
The power of the spatial magic and
your aura are gushing all over the place!

16
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,190
What?

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,570
The thread changed his trajectory...

18
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,860
I'm going to defeat you...

19
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,810
with this weapon!

20
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,650
Despair vs. Hope

21
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,810
That was actually effective!

22
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,260
Now you've done it, human!

23
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,760
Thanks!

24
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,270
T-Talk about scary! If we were even a second
too late, we would've been done for!

25
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,610
Good work, little boy! Keep it up!

26
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,480
No, wait! I didn't even do anything!

27
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,110
It's all thanks to you two!

28
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,160
Amazing... These two are this powerful?

29
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,030
As I thought, I cannot heal.

30
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,660
Did he sever the magic current
that enables self-healing?

31
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:09,060
The one weapon here that has a chance
of defeating me... that anti-magic sword.

32
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,350
If I only had to deal with that unskilled
brat, there would be no issue,

33
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,230
but those two are supporting him
and giving him mobility.

34
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,570
The spatial magic is troublesome,
but the real nuisance

35
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,070
is that woman's thread magic!

36
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,510
Her magic runs through this whole space,

37
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,450
interfering whenever and
wherever she wants.

38
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,470
It cannot attack or bind me personally,

39
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,170
I can barely see it, and it's too
thin for me to detect its magic.

40
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,340
That means I won't be able
to read that brat's moves!

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,980
How amusing.

42
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,010
To think that three people
who are worthless alone

43
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,320
could fight me by banding together...

44
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,850
It makes me sick.

45
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,660
Don't think that you have hope just
because you've banded together, humans!

46
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,740
He's coming!

47
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,540
Let's go!

48
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,660
Got it!

49
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,210
Finral!

50
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,500
Got it!

51
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,070
Not yet, damn it!

52
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,350
He did it!

53
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,850
No! That wound's too shallow!

54
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,850
We won't be able to defeat him
just by scratching him like that!

55
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,360
This'll make things even
more dangerous, but...

56
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,730
We need to let the kid get even closer!

57
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,090
I'm all for getting closer! Bring it on!

58
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,130
I'm not imagining it!

59
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,030
What the hell is this ridiculously
huge and creepy magical power?

60
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,720
This is even more ridiculous than the
ridiculous magical power I felt earlier!

61
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,900
We could say that it's now super ridiculous!

62
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,110
Shut up! Stop saying stupid crap!

63
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,720
P-Please don't look at me!

64
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,310
More importantly, have your
powers recovered at all?

65
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,290
U-Um, not at all yet.

66
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,800
I used all my powers against
that steel ball lardbutt.

67
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,470
I can't shoot even a single Reflect Ray now.

68
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,240
At this point...

69
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,760
Hey, domehead! You're going
to have to go ahead, and...

70
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,300
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

71
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,700
Are you seriously still
eating at a time like this?

72
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,500
La!

73
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,920
My spell from earlier to
summon the Sleeping Sheep

74
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,420
One Hit

75
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,500
eats up my magic, so I'm left starving.

76
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,880
Two Hit

77
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,500
Mega Hit

78
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,820
We can't fight on such empty stomachs!

79
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,510
We all need to eat and recover
as much magic as possible!

80
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,590
Well, I guess you have a point.

81
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,010
We should also eat and recover some magic.

82
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,270
O-Okay!

83
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,200
Take that!

84
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,480
The Magic Knights haven't lost yet!

85
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,690
You can do it!

86
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,700
They're up against a crazy monster,
but they still might have a chance!

87
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,010
That's it! Keep it up!

88
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,350
Offense is the best defense!

89
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,010
Don't give him time to counterattack!

90
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,760
How dare you leave my son and
grandchildren in so much pain?!

91
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,750
Please get revenge! Beat him to a pulp!

92
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,700
Not bad...

93
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,150
Those guys never work together,
but now, by working together,

94
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,730
they've surpassed their limits.

95
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,020
However...

96
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,360
It happened again. He held his
ground against their attack.

97
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,370
Could that bastard be...

98
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,040
I can't let my guard down even for a second.

99
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,420
How long am I supposed to keep
up with this tense situation?

100
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,010
Barely missed!

101
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,720
Get a grip! This is no time for whining!

102
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,250
Asta is holding his own against that monster!

103
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,020
Compared to that, this pressure's nothing!

104
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,750
Finral! Do you still have some magic left?

105
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,020
I-It's going down at an enormous rate,
but I'm still managing!

106
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,170
I mean, I spent all this time
running away and not fighting,

107
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,950
so it works out in the end.

108
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,440
So it doesn't mean that our movements
have gotten any slower...

109
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,240
Huh?

110
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,700
This isn't good.

111
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,900
His timing is starting to match our attacks!

112
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,540
I guess it's about time...

113
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,220
Asta!

114
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,980
This is nothing.

115
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,860
One of his attacks just happened to graze me!

116
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,250
Let's do it again!

117
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,810
Hold it, kid!

118
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,510
Captain Yami?!

119
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,830
You should be the first one to know that

120
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,480
he didn't just happen to graze you,
since you're the one fighting him up close.

121
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,110
That bastard was purposely
not attacking as much

122
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,410
and defending instead to better
understand all of your habits.

123
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,870
Wh-What?

124
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,300
If you barge in unprepared...

125
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,140
He's definitely going to get you next time.

126
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
If you barge in unprepared...

127
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,850
He's definitely going to get you next time.

128
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,520
N-No...

129
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,960
As expected from the Black Swordsman.

130
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,660
That's why I'm saving you for my main dish.

131
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,000
But what difference does
knowing that fact make?

132
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,410
This situation is still filled with despair.

133
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,210
Insects, this next attack will be your last!

134
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,630
You don't get to decide that,
you hairy gorilla!

135
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,630
You, too, Captain!
We won't know until we try!

136
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,510
I know, damn it! Because I'm a
bazillion times stronger than you!

137
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,270
Then stop watching and come help us!

138
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,360
Really? You're going to say that?

139
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,270
The thing that's bugging me the most?!

140
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:39,860
When I'm barely able to keep my blood
from boiling in this dumbass situation...

141
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,360
Hey, kid! You need to calm down, too.

142
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,870
I didn't say you couldn't attack him.

143
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,800
I'm just saying you can't keep doing
the same thing. He's going to kill you...

144
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
Unless you guys change!

145
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,590
Finral!

146
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,380
Vanessa!

147
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,470
Kid!

148
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,270
Yes, sir!

149
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,180
You know exactly what to do

150
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,260
in situations like this!

151
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,690
Right here, right now...

152
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,930
We're going to surpass
our limits even more!

153
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,190
We're surpassing our limits
and speeding things up!

154
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,190
Got it!

155
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,400
Asta!

156
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,910
A draw?

157
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,040
Not yet!

158
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,920
Let's keep on surpassing our limits!

159
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,960
Got it!

160
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,030
Of course!

161
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,710
Take that!

162
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:47,530
Little boy... when I see you fighting
with your little body and no magic,

163
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,680
it gives me a courage
that's frankly unlike me.

164
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,930
I had forgotten. I didn't
want to remember...

165
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,810
how weak I was back in
the Forest of Witches.

166
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:05,260
Hey, did you know that beyond
this forest is a huge city,

167
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,530
and a lot of people who live
there aren't even witches?

168
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,580
Vanessa, you've told me
that hundreds of times.

169
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,500
All the other witches are out playing,
aren't they? Getting boyfriends and stuff.

170
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,050
Why don't you also escape
from this cage and go out?

171
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,800
What? I-I could never do that!

172
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,350
I can't defy the Queen of Witches.

173
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,450
C-Come on, cheer up.

174
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,050
Do you want me to talk to the
Queen of Witches for you?

175
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,110
That's impossible! You're all
dolls I created with my magic.

176
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,740
If I can't do it, there's no
way you could do it.

177
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,080
You're right. Besides, this whole
conversation is just you talking to yourself.

178
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,500
Hopefully you'll be able to make
some real friends someday.

179
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,560
That's impossible... How could I?

180
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,860
I'm always going to be stuck here.

181
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,710
I'll never be free.

182
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,850
That was my fate.

183
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,420
I thought I didn't have a choice.

184
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,800
But...

185
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:31,700
One day I realized that this
wasn't fate. I just lacked courage.

186
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,580
I wasn't wrong for choosing to leave the
Forest of Witches and become a Black Bull.

187
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,370
Only you have the power to
move the threads of fate!

188
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,760
Little boy, I'll pull! Just trust me and go!

189
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,470
I'm counting on you, ma'am!

190
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,570
Curse you insects!

191
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,090
Come on, you two! You're going way too fast!

192
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,130
I swear... this is the problem
with hot-blooded people!

193
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,870
I've always been the guy with no motivation!

194
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,990
Finral...

195
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,920
What is that fragile and
stunted spatial magic?

196
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,730
We of the House of Vaude are a family
of attack spatial magic users that

197
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,840
have been Magic Knights for generations.

198
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,930
You can't fight with magic like that.

199
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:37,100
But I don't want to be violent or
have people be violent toward me.

200
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,190
You weakling!

201
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,000
Goodness! Look at how much
you managed to shave off!

202
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,870
You're so amazing, Langris! A genius!

203
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,590
We'll just have someone
rebuild what he destroyed.

204
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,080
You don't have to worry
about a thing, Langris.

205
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,690
Honestly... Aren't you ashamed to
be outdone by your younger brother?

206
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,060
To think that the difference in
your abilities was this great.

207
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,400
Langris is now the vice
captain of the Golden Dawn.

208
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,710
And yet you're...

209
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,950
...the pack mule for the
weakest squad, the Black Bulls.

210
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,110
We're appointing Langris as the
next head of the House of Vaude.

211
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,040
I doubt you have any objections.

212
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,910
Of course I don't. I was just thinking that'd
be too much for me to handle myself.

213
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,210
Langris, take care of our family for me.

214
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,220
I don't take orders from you, Finral.

215
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,010
You bring shame upon the Vaude family!

216
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,660
You've got a point... but I'm
pretty popular with the ladies.

217
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,560
I ran away from my parents,
my brother, my home, and reality.

218
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,810
Hey there, cuties!

219
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,320
Let's go have some tea. There's a
fancy café just around the corner.

220
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,550
You girls are so cute,

221
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,830
you're going to make me say things
even sweeter than those sweets there.

222
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:25,120
In the midst of that, Asta, I met you,
a kid with absolutely no magic.

223
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,750
It's not that you didn't have enough...

224
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:33,550
You had nothing, but you faced yourself,
kept fighting, and never gave up.

225
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,150
It's true that how I am now,
I'll never beat my brother.

226
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,310
But...

227
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,140
Say, Yami.

228
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,260
Why did you let me join your squad?
I can barely even fight.

229
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,500
So you can take me everywhere.

230
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,320
Huh?

231
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,780
Oh, right... It's not like I can
defeat any enemies with my magic.

232
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,640
You've probably got your own
way of fighting, right?

233
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,650
Huh?

234
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,880
I'm saying that battling doesn't
just mean defeating enemies.

235
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,080
My own way of fighting...

236
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,770
I'm not going to become the strongest.

237
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,060
But I'll make the Black Bulls
the strongest squad!

238
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,320
I had abandoned my own fight.

239
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,740
When I did, there were words
I couldn't say anymore.

240
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,110
But now, I can say them!

241
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,900
Asta! Believe in me!

242
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,120
Trust me and jump in!

243
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,870
Sorry, but I already believe
in you 100 percent!

244
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,960
Not bad for insects!

245
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,310
But you must be nearing your limits.

246
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,950
If even one of you makes the
smallest mistake, you'll die instantly!

247
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,640
How long can you hold up under
such extreme conditions?

248
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,690
Shut up, beast guy!
Until we beat you, of course!

249
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,890
Asta just told me that he
believes in me 100 percent.

250
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,580
I knew that! Otherwise, he could never
fight using this ridiculous method!

251
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,840
Honestly, how can you trust a drunk woman

252
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,410
and a superficial wimp with your life?

253
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,540
If you believe in us so earnestly...

254
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,050
...we can never betray that trust!

255
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,930
I see. That's some
magnificent concentration.

256
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,800
But how about your magic powers?

257
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,310
They'll probably reach their limits soon.

258
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,380
The amount of magic we have...

259
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,070
That's the difference between
myself and you insects!

260
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,630
H-He sure knows how to hit where it hurts.

261
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,610
My spatial holes are becoming smaller.

262
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,490
My threads are screaming.

263
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm almost out of magic, and the
threads are about to break.

264
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,370
So what?!

265
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm going to believe in them both and win!

266
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,880
It's not just them.

267
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,660
Guess we got here in time.

268
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,490
La!

269
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,300
Gauche! Charmy!

270
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,140
And...

271
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,110
Grey. It sounds like some terrible joke,
but apparently, this is her true form.

272
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,640
What?!

273
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,990
P-Please don't look at me!

274
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,240
We can talk later.

275
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,810
Take this! This is all the
magic I have right now!

276
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,870
Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!

277
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,250
What's the matter, insects?

278
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,160
You think you'll actually hit me
just by attacking more?

279
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,200
Nah, I accomplished what I wanted.

280
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,130
Domehead!

281
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,800
Cotton Creation Magic:

282
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,310
Sleeping Sheep's...

283
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,060
One Hit!

284
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,060
One Hit

285
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,810
Two Hit!

286
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,810
Two Hit

287
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,090
Mega Hit!

288
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,440
Mega Hit!!

289
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,190
You're trying to make
some kind of smokescreen?

290
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,070
Annoying little brats!

291
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,910
What?

292
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,330
Wh-What's going on?

293
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,590
I-It's my transformation magic!

294
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,590
I don't have much magic left, so some
may not look exactly like him...

295
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,220
Bring it on!

296
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,030
Domehead! Keep hitting
until you run out of magic!

297
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,220
Lai-lai, sir!

298
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,940
You pesky insects! Despair already!

299
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,600
Despair?

300
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,990
We don't have time for that!

301
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,330
Petit Clover

302
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,250
Petit Clover!

303
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,840
Trinity

304
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,330
Trinity.

305
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,940
Listen carefully. I'm going to use
my thread to change your direction!

306
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,350
Then, I'll use my spatial magic
to move you somewhere else!

307
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,100
But if we miss even once, you'll be finished!

308
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,980
Are you ready?

309
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,600
Yeah! All we can do is charge!

310
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,850
Here we go, Gordon!

311
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,320
Green light!

312
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,730
I believe in you two!

313
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,330
We can never betray that trust!

314
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Green light... Red light.

315
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,540
What?!

316
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,210
I can't tell when Gordon's done saying,
"Green light, red light," at all.

317
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,090
I'm so sorry, Asta.

318
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,220
He's just too strong.

319
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,160
This is so much fun. You're it next, Asta.

320
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,370
I'll make sure I get to you.

321
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,310
Oh, no. I sense that my
friends are in trouble.

322
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,730
I want to help you all. Please stay safe.

323
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,150
I hope my feelings reach you all.

324
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,270
Black Clover, Page 49: "Beyond Limits."

325
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:54,250
Page 49
Beyond Limits

326
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,740
My magic is becoming friends with anyone.
