1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,490
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,030
Hey, isn't this just messed up?

5
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,410
Why did I have to get kicked out?

6
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,420
I have more magical power than the royals do.

7
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,330
Magic is everything in
this world... isn't it?

8
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,880
This is a load of bull!

9
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,090
Who are you talking to?

10
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,140
I'm just talking to myself.

11
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,340
We're ready.

12
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,610
Yeah... I'll show the Clover Kingdom's
Magic Knights the true extent of my powers!

13
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,710
I would always close my eyes

14
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,050
And cower at reality

15
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,720
I can't stand the idea

16
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,100
Of just making excuses to give up

17
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,250
Stand right there

18
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,400
I don't want to be near you

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,540
Any minute now

20
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,900
Just wait right there

21
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,900
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

22
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,980
Black and blue

23
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,910
I'll give up on giving up

24
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,410
And get the world on my side

25
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

26
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,290
Every time somewhere under this sky

27
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:39,180
Break through the tearful nights

28
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,430
And head where the light shines

29
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,270
I want to keep my promise

30
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,810
I'll deliver it to you

31
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,360
shape of love

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,550
Capital Riot

33
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,580
There's no reason to run from these jerks.

34
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,080
Asta?

35
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,840
Calling us peasants, rats,
embarrassments, failures...

36
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,430
Who cares if you think we're worthy or not?!

37
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,180
Just you watch! I'm going to—

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,260
That's enough, you scoundrel.

39
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,100
You shouldn't even be allowed to talk!

40
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,130
Silence!

41
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,900
I won't shut up!

42
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,620
He just...

43
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,200
Listen up, you bastards!

44
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm going to pile up merit,

45
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,510
become the Wizard King,

46
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,200
and shut you all up!

47
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,710
Leopold

48
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,710
Fuegoleon

49
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,210
Sol

50
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,210
Charlotte

51
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,720
Hamon

52
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,720
Alecdora

53
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,720
Shiren

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,220
Solid

55
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,220
Nozel

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,220
Nebra

57
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,660
You fool

58
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,860
A-Asta...

59
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,690
Not a chance.

60
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,230
Become...

61
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,110
...the Wizard King?

62
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,200
Don't make us laugh!

63
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,250
Water Binding Magic: Sea Serpent's Coils!

64
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,590
What?

65
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,760
Mist Binding Magic: Mist Spider's Threads.

66
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,970
I knew it...

67
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,700
He's erasing the magic.

68
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,450
He's no ordinary peasant.

69
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,810
But...

70
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,950
If that's his attack range,
there's no reason for concern.

71
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,750
Sand Creation Magic: Sand-Armored Guard!

72
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,510
A-Asta!

73
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,140
I-I think that's enough.

74
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,640
Keep your mouth shut.

75
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,310
Y-Yes, sir.

76
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,600
To act in such a way at a festive occasion
like the decoration ceremony...

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,320
You will surely be punished.

78
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,010
Come on, now...

79
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,830
Why so soft, Golden Dawn?

80
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,130
Anyone that self-confident
needs to be taught a lesson.

81
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,340
That's...

82
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,920
So that they can never talk back again.

83
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,630
Solid, please don't!

84
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,640
Holy Water Bullet!

85
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,350
Asta!

86
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,690
You're such an embarrassment.

87
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,370
Apologize...

88
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,210
to Noelle!

89
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,720
Did you just make me kneel?

90
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
You lowly peasant!

91
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,180
I'm not holding back anymore!

92
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,970
Solid, p-please, no more...

93
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,420
Nozel?

94
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,170
Solid, don't be so quick to use
your magic on a mere peasant.

95
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,470
B-But...

96
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,870
Silence.

97
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,930
Do you plan to shame the Silva family?

98
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,050
What is this chill in the air?

99
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,830
It's a cold pressure that's
different from Captain Yami's...

100
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,970
This is the Captain of the Silver Eagles?

101
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,630
A peasant that foolishly tried to
defy royalty... How shall I punish you?

102
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,170
Wh-What should I do?
At this rate, Asta will...

103
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,510
That's enough.

104
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,430
You're getting so worked
up over a little boy.

105
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,810
You should be ashamed of yourself, Silvas.

106
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
It's just as Mimosa said.

107
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,530
You're quite amusing!

108
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,030
Huh?

109
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:41,340
All right, rejoice! I, Leopold Vermillion,
declare you my rival!

110
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,710
Huh?

111
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,090
What was your name? Casta?

112
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,100
Leopold, it's Asta. He's Asta.

113
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,530
Asta, eh? That's a great name, my rival!

114
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,010
R-Rival?!

115
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,180
Come, now! Rejoice!

116
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,720
Rejoice.

117
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,640
Y-Yay...

118
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,190
Vermillion...

119
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,070
Leopold and Fuegoleon are my cousins.

120
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:24,120
Leopold

121
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:24,120
Mimosa

122
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:24,120
Noelle

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:24,120

2nd Son

139
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:19,200
My father's older brother is
Fuegoleon and Leopold's father.

140
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,120
Also, my mother's older
sister is Noelle's mother.

141
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,490
Too many royals.

142
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,370
Huh?

143
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,030
Um... Thanks, but my rival's actually
Yuno, who's standing over there.

144
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,230
No worries! One can never
have too many rivals!

145
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,760
What the heck?

146
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,940
Hey, Asta! You have a very nice body!

147
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,270
You are indeed qualified to be my rival!

148
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,620
All right! Let us arm wrestle.

149
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,770
Why?!

150
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,010
Guys really are dumb, aren't they, Sis?

151
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,280
Mind your manners, Sol.

152
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,000
My bad, Sis!

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,300
Call me "Captain," Sol.

154
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
My bad, Sis!

155
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,620
Sol...

156
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,660
I know, Sis!

157
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,370
Sis!

158
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,890
Come at me!

159
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,420
Is now really the time for this?

160
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,080
Why are you holding back? Come!

161
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,130
What?!

162
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,380
Becoming Leopold's rival...
Asta truly is amazing!

163
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,100
My, aren't we all so very noisy today?

164
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,730
Looks like things have calmed down.

165
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,230
A royal acknowledging a peasant as his rival?

166
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,340
Lord Julius allowed the boy to be here.

167
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,640
He may be a peasant, but doesn't
he deserve a little credit?

168
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,590
I never thought I'd hear such
nonsense from a royal's mouth.

169
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,810
It appears that the Vermillion
family has gone soft.

170
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,380
You're a disgrace to us all.

171
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,010
What?

172
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,260
How am I, an eagle that soars the sky,

173
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,270
supposed to give any credit to an
insect that crawls on the ground?

174
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,070
Wh-What a tremendous clash of mana!

175
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,120
H-Holy crap...

176
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,540
You can feel it?

177
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,620
Even if I can't feel their mana,
I can tell... that this is amazing!

178
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,570
Shouldn't we stop them, Sis?

179
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,950
This is foolish. Ignore the men
and their boorish fighting.

180
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,610
Also, call me "Captain."

181
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,600
Sure thing, Sis!

182
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,310
Call me—

183
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,300
Th-There's an emergency!

184
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,530
What's wrong?

185
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,320
Th-The capital!

186
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,670
The capital is under attack!

187
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,870
Destroy!

188
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,760
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy!

189
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,550
Wh-What's going on?

190
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,460
Destroy all the fools who
can't understand my worth!

191
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,160
Such disgusting creatures.
Where did they come from?

192
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,210
You must not value your lives, if you're
invading the royal capital like this!

193
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,270
Wh-What are these things?

194
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,090
They keep coming toward us even
when we shoot their limbs off!

195
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,350
Do not falter!

196
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,010
Protect the Clover Ki—

197
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,520
You won't be able to, you scum!

198
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,560
Get lost, scum! Scum! Scum!

199
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,110
What is this magic?

200
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,060
You're stronger than me, right? Right?!

201
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,330
Get out here, Magic Knights!

202
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,530
The Royal Capital is under attack?!

203
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,380
Stone Creation Magic:
Stone Model of the World.

204
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,650
It's... a three-dimensional
model of the Noble Realm?

205
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,940
W-Wow!

206
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,100
Even the voices of the people at
the scene and their magic levels...

207
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,040
Is he lacing the whole area with mana
and simultaneously making it visible?

208
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,150
This is much more advanced than
my Magic Flower Guidepost!

209
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,220
A force with this much magic appears
in five places simultaneously,

210
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,430
without us noticing...

211
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,570
A formidable spatial magic user must have
made them materialize in an instant.

212
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,080
Even then, the guard mages of
the Noble Realm work in shifts,

213
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,210
constantly keeping a magic barrier in place.

214
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,420
It should be impossible to
enter with spatial magic.

215
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,390
Did they analyze the barrier's
mechanism and break through it?

216
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,130
Or did one of the guard mages betray us?

217
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,720
Either way, they must
be phenomenally skilled.

218
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,220
How should we assign the
members we currently have?

219
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,480
First, we need to guard the
area around the castle.

220
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,980
Wait, what the heck are we waiting for?!

221
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,170
I get it! There are people
out there who need our help!

222
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,780
I'm gonna go!

223
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,860
Asta!

224
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,450
Where do you plan to go?

225
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,950
We don't even know the full situation yet,
and you can't sense magic at all!

226
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,040
I'm going to where it's noisiest!

227
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,160
Wha— D-Do you think you're
an animal or something?!

228
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,410
Interesting!

229
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,690
Let's see what you've got!

230
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,410
Wait for me, Asta, my rival!

231
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,730
Guys really are dumb, aren't they, Sis?

232
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,030
Yes, they are.

233
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,380
And call me "Captain."

234
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,540
Leo's still very much a child.

235
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,060
I'll have to thoroughly retrain him later.

236
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,570
I'm sure you'd rather not take orders
from me, but listen well, Magic Knights!

237
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,710
I'll go after Leo and that Black Bulls boy,

238
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,820
and after I've joined them,
we'll head to the north district.

239
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,780
You, Black Bulls girl, come with me.

240
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,940
Silver Eagles, I ask that you
head to the central district,

241
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,360
where the magic is strongest.

242
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,350
Very well.

243
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,570
Blue Roses, head to the east district!

244
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,980
I'd rather not take orders from a man,
but I suppose I don't have a choice.

245
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,940
Here we go, Sis!

246
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,130
Call me "Captain."

247
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,050
Golden Dawn, split into two teams and head
to the west and northwest districts!

248
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,390
We will protect the people of the Nobel Realm.

249
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,760
Let us go.

250
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,650
I guess we'll just have
to save dessert for later.

251
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,130
If we fail to protect the royal capital,
we'll bring shame upon the Magic Knights!

252
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,900
Do not let the enemy escape, no matter what!

253
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,450
Right!

254
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,900
Munchy, munchy...

255
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,820
I managed to get in by following
Asta and the others,

256
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,070
but it looks like something
awful is happening.

257
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,330
This looks like a job for Charmy!

258
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,540
If I do good, I might get the chance
to eat even better food!

259
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,190
I smell something delicious!

260
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,940
I have to fuel up before the battle!

261
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,530
Central District

262
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,590
Don't think you're going to get away with...

263
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,950
What? What do you want?

264
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,910
I'll give it to you, just—

265
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,550
East District

266
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,780
Mind your manners, Sol.

267
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,020
My bad, Sis!

268
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,310
Call me "Captain."

269
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,840
Northwest District

270
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,930
Those who dare to bring chaos upon the
kingdom shall perish before my magic!

271
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,240
These things keep getting
up with half-assed attacks.

272
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,950
In that case...

273
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,230
West District

274
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,820
I guess we should work off
some calories before dessert.

275
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,380
Fools who disturb the peace of the capital...
You shall be eliminated!

276
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,910
North District

277
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,040
Wh-What is this?

278
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,540
I've never seen them before.
What country is that army from?

279
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,450
Where's Asta?

280
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,340
Little girl... Do you like the Clover Kingdom?

281
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,940
I-I love it!

282
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,050
So please... stop this.

283
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,350
Well, I hate it!

284
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,980
So the town... the people...

285
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,400
And you, too, little girl...

286
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,190
I'll destroy you all!

287
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,380
Then I'll protect them!

288
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

289
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,570
And push me forward

290
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,660
(I can't find a place to go)

291
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

292
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,390
And change the flow of time

293
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,810
(I will keep believing in you)

294
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,690
In this ever-vivid place

295
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,680
(Break free yourself)

296
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

297
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,190
If there is a path that I should choose

298
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

299
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,160
Wherever it may lead us

300
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,650
Until my life comes to an end

301
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

302
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

303
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

304
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

305
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

306
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,350
Petit Clover

307
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,310
Petit Clover!

308
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,860
Mr. Animal

309
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,580
Mr. Animal.

310
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,940
I'm going to where it's noisiest!

311
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,030
Wha— D-Do you think you're
an animal or something?!

312
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,070
An animal?

313
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,240
Woof, woof.

314
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,070
A dog... My, how adorable.

315
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,760
But a cat might be nice, too.

316
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,210
Meow, meow.

317
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,350
How delightful!

318
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,010
Oh, but maybe something
even wilder, like a wolf...

319
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,220
All men are wolves.

320
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,810
Oh, I just can't choose!

321
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,650
Not a chance...

322
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,650
What a creepy enemy! But there's
no time to be creeped out.

323
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,930
I will protect the citizens
of the Clover Kingdom!

324
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,070
Black Clover, Page 22:
"Wild Magic Dance."

325
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:55,250
Page 22
Wild Magic Dance

326
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,740
If you're hurt, please come to me!
