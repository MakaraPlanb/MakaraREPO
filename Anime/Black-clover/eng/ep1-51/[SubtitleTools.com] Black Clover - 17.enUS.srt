1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,680
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,180
Well, this isn't good at all.

5
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,520
You're going to make an old man get serious.

6
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,710
Smoke Creation Magic:
Prison of the Fallen King.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,610
You won't be able to get away anymore, kids.

8
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,150
No matter who we're facing,

9
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,160
we, the Black Bulls, will win!

10
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm going to get serious now.

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,200
What are you...

12
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,210
Wind Creation Magic: Swift White Hawk
and Wind Blade Shower.

13
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,380
Simultaneous spell activation?!

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,260
It will be the Golden Dawn that
reaches the treasure chamber first!

15
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,850
Take that!

16
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,660
I'm getting dizzy...

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,410
The smoke just keeps getting thicker.

18
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,700
At this rate, we're going to suffocate.

19
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,080
This isn't good. We have to
hurry up and defeat that mage.

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,430
I can pretty much tell
where he is with my magic,

21
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,410
but he'll probably dodge, even if I attack.

22
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,340
Thinking back on our battle so far,

23
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,270
he's able to travel at high
speed within the smoke.

24
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,770
And his ability to sense magic is high.

25
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,010
If we're to land a hit on him,
we'll have to surprise him.

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,820
But how do we do that without
him noticing our magic?

27
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,290
Because I can sense your magic just fine.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,870
Whoa, there!

29
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,290
Wow, a barrage. Are you getting desperate?

30
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,210
That's not going to hit me

31
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,840
or get rid of the smoke.

32
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,880
I think the difference in our
experience levels is starting to show.

33
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,350
After all, I've fought far
more mages than you have.

34
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,140
It went well.

35
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,900
I guess teamwork really is important.

36
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,810
I would always close my eyes

37
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,010
And cower at reality

38
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,770
I can't stand the idea

39
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:38,110
Of just making excuses to give up

40
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,230
Stand right there

41
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,320
I don't want to be near you

42
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,500
Any minute now

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,880
Just wait right there

44
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,880
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,200
Black and blue

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,990
I'll give up on giving up

47
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,410
And get the world on my side

48
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

49
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,090
Every time somewhere under this sky

50
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,180
Break through the tearful nights

51
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,400
And head where the light shines

52
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,230
I want to keep my promise

53
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,050
I'll deliver it to you

54
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,820
shape of love

55
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,500
Destroyer

56
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,870
Ow...

57
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,890
How could you do that to a
defenseless old man like me?

58
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,970
Man... It's definitely broken.

59
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,060
Pretty sure he got some of my ribs, too.

60
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,980
I won't be able to fight anymore.

61
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,330
There sure are some oddballs
in the Clover Kingdom.

62
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,580
A boy with no magic
who wields a giant sword...

63
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,610
I can safely say that even I've never met
someone with no magic on the battlefield.

64
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,470
If I'm going to end up a prisoner...

65
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,910
I'll di—

66
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,480
Or just run away.

67
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,970
Hey!

68
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,410
Wait!

69
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,870
You're not getting away!

70
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,840
Smoke Creation Magic: Hustling Lazy Car.

71
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,090
Caught up with you!

72
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,810
Aw...

73
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,060
Damn it! We lost him!

74
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,820
You two...

75
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,250
are way too fast.

76
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,830
I wanted to finish him off,

77
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,360
but I know we have more
important things to do.

78
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,250
We need to hurry to the treasure chamber.

79
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,830
You really have the nerve to say that?

80
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,340
Oh, yeah! Let's get going!

81
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,290
What is this magic?

82
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,100
It looks like there's someone
even stronger here.

83
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,640
Are you all okay?

84
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,580
I guess the treasure chamber is
the least of our worries right now.

85
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,590
Ow...

86
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,950
Well, I'm pretty sure Mars
will take care of the rest.

87
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,990
I mean...

88
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,500
Diamond Kingdom Mage Warrior
Mars

89
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,500
He's the Diamond Kingdom's
secret weapon, after all.

90
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,620
Such ominous magic...

91
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,800
Yuno's at full strength,
and even he stands no chance...

92
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,110
Those stones embedded in his forehead...

93
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,810
I've heard of them before.

94
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,470
There's a rumor that the Diamond
Kingdom is raising mage warriors

95
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,210
with artificially amplified magic.

96
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,210
They choose young children
with powerful magical abilities,

97
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,240
put them in fierce competition
with each other,

98
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,720
embed magical items that amplify
their powers into their bodies...

99
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,600
And finally, they have them
fight one another to the death.

100
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,610
The last survivor of that death match...

101
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,270
is him?

102
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,890
No matter who the opponent is...
Is this really acceptable?

103
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,140
What is happening here?

104
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,150
I'm a noble!

105
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,130
A member of the Golden Dawn!

106
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,530
I let my comrade get hurt so easily.

107
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,130
I'm being protected by my
subordinate, who's a peasant.

108
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,990
This...

109
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
This cannot be right!

110
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,630
Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

111
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,670
Klaus!

112
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,600
Wha—

113
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,320
A mineral clone?

114
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,560
Klaus!

115
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,860
Your magic has no effect on me.

116
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,430
It's no use.

117
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,000
I told you, it's no use.

118
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,050
It's no use.

119
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,430
Let's stop this training,

120
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,560
Asta.

121
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,140
Not yet!

122
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,640
I'm not quitting until I hit you!

123
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,110
Oh, no!

124
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,560
Asta.

125
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,910
Not...

126
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,910
Not yet!

127
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,910
Let's stop.

128
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,910
No!

129
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,660
I'm never...

130
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,460
...going to give up!

131
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,580
Stop your useless attempts—

132
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,670
I won't!

133
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,930
Move.

134
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,680
I won't move!

135
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,930
Give up.

136
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,710
I won't give up!

137
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,200
Yuno!

138
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,890
Hey, pale guy.

139
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,760
Hands off!

140
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,310
Yuno's my...

141
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,820
rival!

142
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,240
Yuno!

143
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,710
Hey, pale guy.

144
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,750
Hands off!

145
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,190
Yuno's my...

146
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,700
rival!

147
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,270
Unbelievable... and I thought
I finally repaid my debt to you.

148
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,710
I finally catch up with you, and look at you!
What the hell are you doing, Yuno?! Damn it!

149
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,460
Who said you could get your ass kicked?

150
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,450
Why'd you get in my way?

151
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,550
I almost had him.

152
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,970
Liar! You're all beat up!

153
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,060
You were about to die!

154
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,960
I was just about to unleash
a ferocious counterattack.

155
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,640
You're such a liar!

156
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,170
I was about to do it.

157
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,610
You're always like this!

158
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,880
Did you come to get in my way?

159
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,410
What?!

160
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,750
You can go home now.

161
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,410
Fine, then.

162
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,910
Let's see who can take this guy down first!

163
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,480
Wh-What's going on?

164
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,760
We, the Golden Dawn, didn't stand a
chance against his magic, and yet...

165
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,450
That peasant from the Black Bulls...

166
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,210
Oh, no!

167
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,200
Weak.

168
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,150
He's...

169
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,630
The one who made trouble at
the Entrance Exam by beating

170
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,520
his opponent far worse than necessary!

171
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,010
Luck the Cheery Berserker!

172
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,490
This was the other member of
the Black Bulls that was here?

173
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,990
How could I end up being
saved by the Black Bulls?!

174
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,900
Mimosa!

175
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,960
Well, this is embarrassing...

176
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,380
Just as you said, I'm a bit slow.

177
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,700
Yes.

178
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,240
You've always been like that.

179
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,040
That's why...

180
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,770
I'm going to protect you.

181
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,730
Noelle...

182
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,780
Are you the one who beat up the Golden Dawn?

183
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,530
What if I am?

184
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,660
The weak will perish,
and only the strong will remain.

185
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,510
That's all that matters.

186
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,090
He summoned so many at once!

187
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,090
There is no reason for the weak
to stand on the battlefield.

188
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,090
I was born to break people like you.

189
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,100
Oh, really?

190
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,250
Then go ahead...

191
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,520
and try to break me!

192
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,110
I intend to.

193
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,290
He's so strong!

194
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,300
Aw, man...

195
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,750
I wanted to be the one to fight him!

196
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,810
Impossible...

197
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,870
How could a peasant that I can't feel
a shred of mana from do all this?

198
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,280
All you've been doing is whining.

199
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,110
Negating magic...

200
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,540
That's Asta's power.

201
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,540
Negating magic?

202
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,550
How can he have a power
so unfit for a peasant?!

203
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,800
So he just got lucky and
ended up with this power.

204
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,790
Just watch him, and you'll
find out if it's just luck or not.

205
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,890
Hey, come on! Are you
finished already, you jerk?

206
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,810
Asta!

207
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,330
What...

208
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,020
are you?

209
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,590
I'm someone who was born without any magic!

210
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,800
He doesn't have any magic?!

211
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,170
So it really was just luck—

212
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,300
But even so, I'm going to
become the Wizard King!

213
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,100
And I'm alive...

214
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,460
to prove that!

215
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,490
What is going on with his body?
How much has he trained?!

216
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,110
The Wizard King? Does he truly...

217
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,820
Mars!

218
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,770
What do you want to be when you grow up?

219
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm...

220
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,380
I'm just going to destroy everything!

221
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,630
Destroy everything?

222
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,480
The Wizard King protects everyone!

223
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,640
We were born to protect
everyone in this country.

224
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,890
Like hell I'm going to lose
to someone like you!

225
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,230
You're in my way...

226
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,740
Begone, pebble!

227
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,490
I may be just a pebble,

228
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,990
but I'm...

229
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,330
a pebble that shatters diamonds!

230
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,260
See?

231
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,820
If you don't give up,
you'll get there eventually!

232
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

233
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,570
And push me forward

234
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,630
(I can't find a place to go)

235
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

236
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:18,390
And change the flow of time

237
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,810
(I will keep believing in you)

238
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,690
In this ever-vivid place

239
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,650
(Break free yourself)

240
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

241
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,190
If there is a path that I should choose

242
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

243
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,160
Wherever it may lead us

244
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,650
Until my life comes to an end

245
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

246
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

247
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

248
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

249
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

250
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,280
Petit Clover

251
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,580
Petit Clover!

252
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,790
Treasure Chamber

253
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,910
Treasure Chamber.

254
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,700
Ooh! So this is the treasure chamber!

255
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,790
I wonder if there's any
treasure worthy of me.

256
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,300
Let's just randomly open
stuff up and see what's inside!

257
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,410
Hey, no fair doing it all yourself!

258
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,300
Open sesame—

259
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,460
It's no treasure chamber.
It's an organ chamber.

260
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,500
This isn't my fault.

261
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,990
This old man's exhausted.

262
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,360
I don't know how much more abuse
I can take from home and work.

263
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,550
Black Clover, Page 18: "Memories of You."

264
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:55,250
Page 18
Memories of You

265
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,610
Leaving the rest to the young'uns
is this old man's magic.
