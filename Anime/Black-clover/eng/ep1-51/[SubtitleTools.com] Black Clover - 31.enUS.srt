1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,640
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,800
Asta visited Nean, the town where
Rebecca and her siblings lived,

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,770
but it turned out to be where Gauche's
beloved little sister Marie lived, as well.

6
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,020
All right! Are you read—

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,350
Huh? What?

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,990
Get away from her this instant, you trash!

9
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,110
That night, a certain incident struck Nean.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,820
Die, Asta.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,670
That's not even your house!

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,200
Snow? When did it pile up so much?

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,670
It's not even the season for that yet.

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,460
Hey! What do you two think you're doing?!

15
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,090
The kids are gone!

16
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,810
Starting today,

17
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,990
you're all my friends.

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,790
Pursuit Over the Snow

19
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,510
Luca, Marco, where could
you have gone at this hour?

20
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,580
Barshim!

21
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,650
Helen, where are you?

22
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,460
Guess they didn't just go out to pee—

23
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,580
Die!

24
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,630
I'll never let you marry my sister.

25
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,880
Now's not the time for that!

26
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,940
There's nothing more important
than Marie, damn it!

27
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,470
I'll kill you!

28
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,770
Hey, what the heck's going on in this town?

29
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,810
Why is it snowing this time
of year? This is absurd!

30
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,460
Noelle? What are you doing here?

31
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,460
I-I just happened to be in the area.
It's just a coincidence.

32
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,380
Who's this, Asta?

33
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,150
She's one of my Magic Knight buddies.

34
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,320
And Noelle, this is my friend Rebecca.

35
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,450
Friend...

36
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,580
Buddy...

37
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,260
Huh...

38
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,180
What's wrong?

39
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,710
N-Nothing...

40
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,960
More importantly,

41
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,510
I saw a whole bunch of kids go
up to the mountains earlier.

42
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,460
What's that about?

43
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,290
Do you guys have some
festival this late at night?

44
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,720
That must be...

45
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,970
I'm going to make you bleed.

46
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,380
Stop it.

47
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,620
Old hag...

48
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,980
The old Sister!

49
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,350
I feel magical power in this snow.

50
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,980
There is magic at work here.

51
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,480
Magic that can control others...

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,630
and that only affects children
whose magic hasn't matured.

53
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,740
What?

54
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,120
A number of ours were taken, too.

55
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,210
What do they mean to do,
taking all these children?

56
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,750
Hey, old hag, what do you mean, "taken"?

57
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,750
Don't tell me Marie was, too!

58
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,470
Sadly, that is what I'm saying.

59
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,580
You old hag!

60
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,420
Sister Theresa!

61
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,540
How could you let that happen,
you stupid old hag?!

62
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,720
Please stop!

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,330
So quick to resort to violence...
You really are a failure.

64
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,020
If you want to hit me, go ahead.

65
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,330
But that won't bring back the children.
It won't bring back Marie.

66
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,270
You're right.

67
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,380
But I won't feel better until I do!

68
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,780
Asta! Are you all right?!

69
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,280
Asta, you bastard.

70
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,470
Oh, come on now, Gauche.

71
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,690
Just cool down a little, okay?

72
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,630
A Magic Knight needs to
stay calm at all times.

73
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,630
Well, listen to you.

74
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,070
Calm, eh? You're right.

75
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,140
So you finally understand?

76
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,700
I'll calmly kill you.

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,730
I went too far!

78
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,030
That hurt, you stupid little brat!

79
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,660
Wait, wait, wait!
Now's not the time for this!

80
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,970
We need to find some clues!

81
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,350
What? As if it'll be that easy!

82
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,860
The magic mirror that I have Marie
keep with her at all times...

83
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,610
I wouldn't be able to transmit
to it because of this snow,

84
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,120
but if I search for the
mana in that mirror...

85
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,260
I should be able to figure out where she is.

86
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,710
That's it!

87
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,100
All right! I may have figured
that out, but I'm still killing you.

88
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,380
I'll kill you while giving thanks.

89
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,890
I'm going, as well. I'm going to get the
kids from the church and the town back.

90
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,610
Old Sister, leave this to us.

91
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,780
No. As much as it pains me to
say it, this old hag will be useful.

92
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,940
Huh? She's not just an ordinary old lady?

93
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,110
I'm not going to lose to
you young'uns just yet.

94
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:33,080
Asta... Marco's an idiot and Luca's too
headstrong, so I'm worried about them...

95
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,000
What should I do? If something
were to happen to them...

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,910
Get a hold of yourself, Rebecca!

97
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,670
Take that!

98
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,420
It'll be fine! I'll get them
back, no matter what!

99
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,700
They'll laugh at you if you're
all panicky when we get back.

100
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,180
Y-You're right.

101
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,060
Let's go.

102
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,810
Hey, I'm going, too!

103
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,810
You can't fly on your own either, can you?
Do you want to dangle, like him?

104
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,950
The town might be attacked again.

105
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,780
Would you mind staying behind?

106
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,060
And could you report back
to the Magic Knights?

107
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,060
I'm counting on you, Asta!

108
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,040
I have to stay behind with her?

109
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,490
I'm so happy I made so many friends.

110
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,910
L-Let's all get along.

111
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,660
Where am I?

112
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,080
This isn't the church. What am I doing here?

113
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,080
Everyone seems out of it. What's wrong?

114
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,860
Who is that?

115
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,280
Make sure you stay good boys and
girls with the spell I'm using.

116
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,310
Did he put a spell on everyone?

117
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,030
Come to think of it, Brother did say that

118
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,550
the mirror he gave me would
protect me from magic a little.

119
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,600
Hang on to this mirror as if it were me.

120
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,460
So that's why I...

121
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,050
Looks like my spell on you has been broken.

122
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,320
I wonder why. You bad little girl...

123
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,320
We can't be friends if you won't be
a good girl and stay under my spell.

124
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,490
But you're wrong. Putting someone under
a spell and making them do what you say

125
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,120
doesn't make them a real friend.

126
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,980
How could you say something so cruel?

127
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,130
A friend would never say that!

128
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,760
Neige...

129
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,550
I told you not to damage the goods.

130
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,600
Honestly, you're so hopeless.

131
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm sorry, Baro!

132
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,690
She's the prize this time. Imagine
having that much magic at her age!

133
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,010
Having this many brats means a big payday!

134
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,210
That brat barely has any magic.

135
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,350
I told you to only bring ones
with a lot of magic, Neige!

136
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,750
Sorry, Baro.

137
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,800
Just gonna have to throw
trash like this away.

138
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,650
Sheesh. Stop wasting my time.

139
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,110
Now, then... Let's draw the magic out of you.

140
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,410
We're close. The mana's getting stronger.

141
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,000
Right!

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,290
These enemies must possess
powerful magic. Be on your guard.

143
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,840
Wait for me, Marie.

144
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,880
Please be safe, everyone!

145
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,820
Everyone, please stay calm.
We, the Magic Knights, will find all the kids.

146
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,110
The Magic Knights!

147
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,060
Please get my son back!

148
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,670
What's going on?

149
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,110
Where are Luca and Marco?

150
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,240
Well...

151
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,370
Don't worry. Asta and Gauche
will bring them all back soon.

152
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,050
Y-Yeah! So don't you worry.

153
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,870
Also...

154
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,380
Why's our house broken?

155
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,380
S-Stupidsta and Gauche will fix
that when they get back, too.

156
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,190
We should do what we can
to fix it up for now.

157
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,590
There's snow everywhere inside.

158
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,640
Oh, I need to contact
the other Magic Knights.

159
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,550
Magic Knights' Headquarters here, bah-ha!

160
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,650
Haven't I seen you before?

161
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,010
A-Are you really from headquarters?

162
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:25,070
Bah-ha! It's not my main job, but
Captain Jack ordered me to help out here.

163
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,870
I've been doing so good lately that they're
letting me take a break from all the battles.

164
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,700
Or something like that, bah-ha!

165
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,370
I don't care! We have an emergency!

166
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,670
There's snow! There's snow in Nean!

167
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,670
Snow? How romantic!

168
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,390
Are you stupid?!

169
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,030
Someone made this snow fall
on the town using magic

170
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,820
so they could kidnap all the kids here!

171
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,680
What? You should hurry up and
contact the Magic Knights.

172
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,160
That's what I'm doing right now!

173
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,010
R-Right!

174
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,690
There's nothing to worry
about anymore! Bah-ha!

175
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,940
Somehow, I'm even more worried now.

176
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,870
I sense mana in there.

177
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,370
A cave. That must be where
all the abducted children are!

178
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,340
That's...

179
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,340
Gauche, could you let me down a sec?

180
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,470
Not my problem. I don't care
about anyone besides Marie.

181
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,720
If you want to go, then jump off.

182
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,420
Hup!

183
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,610
Asta! How can you call
yourself a Magic Knight?!

184
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,870
I don't care what happens to the others,
as long as I can protect Marie.

185
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:55,080
On the day that I, a former prisoner,
joined the Black Bulls, the captain told me...

186
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,210
You can just protect whoever
you want to protect.

187
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,220
And that's exactly what I'll be doing.

188
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,850
Marco!

189
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,470
Wake up.

190
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,120
This is awful. He's covered in
wounds, and he's frostbitten.

191
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,220
Marco?

192
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,590
It's no use. He's under a spell
and still unconscious.

193
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,110
All right... Leave it to me!

194
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,110
What are you—

195
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,300
Huh? Asta... Sister...

196
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,540
Are you all right, Marco?

197
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,270
What was that just now? He erased the magic?

198
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,300
It hurts...

199
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,410
Just a second...

200
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,870
Flame Recovery Magic: Sacred Healing Light.

201
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,890
It's so warm...

202
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,160
You're amazing, old lady!
You can even heal wounds?

203
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,340
What in the world happened?

204
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,400
I... don't know.

205
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,940
He's so hurt.

206
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,830
Marco...

207
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,930
We have to go save your
sister and the other kids.

208
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,160
Can you wait in that cave by yourself?

209
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,820
Huh? No! I'm scared, Asta.

210
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,910
Stay with me, please.

211
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,170
What are you talking about?
You're a man, too, aren't you?

212
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,050
Just this once, I'll let you
borrow my Black Bulls robe!

213
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,840
As long as you have this on, you'll be fine!

214
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,680
It's got Magic Knight
courage in it, after all!

215
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,470
You can wait until we get back, right?

216
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,190
Yeah!

217
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,060
But don't forget! I'm only
letting you borrow it!

218
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,040
You're going to give it back to me later!

219
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,190
You'll give it back, right?
And don't get any snot on it!

220
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,740
Y-Yup.

221
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,870
All right, we have to hurry.
I'm worried about the others.

222
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,430
It's like a damn maze in here.

223
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,210
But the mana's getting stronger and stronger.

224
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,460
Just wait a little longer, Marie.

225
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,970
Good, good. More, more!

226
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,660
I'm going to squeeze every last
drop of magic out of you brats!

227
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,970
And done.

228
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,240
Now, then... Are we going
to use our prize next?

229
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,980
N-No! S-Stop!

230
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,110
Please! Let me go!

231
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,980
You can't defy Baro.

232
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,790
Just give it up. I'm gonna make
a fortune off of your magic.

233
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,260
Marie!

234
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,890
Brother!

235
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,140
Thank goodness! You're sa—

236
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,890
What did you do to Marie, you bastards?!

237
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,970
I-It's an enemy, Baro! He has
a Magic Knight robe on!

238
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,680
Damn it! How'd they find us so quickly?

239
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,930
Do something! Use your magic, Neige!

240
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,160
R-Right.

241
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Snow Magic: Snow Cry!

242
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,250
Mirror Magic: Mirror Shift.

243
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,260
Wh-What the heck is that spell?!

244
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,700
I-I can't hit him at all!

245
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,060
Marie!

246
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,480
H-Hurry up and use a
different spell, you oaf!

247
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:48,750
S-Snow Creation Magic: Snow Friends!

248
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,230
Go, my friends!

249
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,060
Damn it!

250
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,370
Defeating one or two won't make a difference!

251
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,680
Neige can keep creating an
infinite number of these guys!

252
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,550
Brother!

253
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,010
Give me a break!

254
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,020
Mirror Magic:

255
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,720
Reflect Refrain!

256
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,520
Time for a massacre.

257
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,880
All of my friends...

258
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,380
That guy's too strong. And he's scary!

259
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,270
Damn it... This isn't what we were told about.

260
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,970
I only accepted this job
because we were told that

261
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,300
it'd just be draining brats of their magic!

262
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,300
What's the deal with this guy's magic?!

263
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,900
What should we do, Baro?

264
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,870
Shut up, you moron!

265
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,810
Th-Think! There has to be some way! Something...

266
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,620
Move an inch, and see what happens to her!

267
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,710
You bastard!

268
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,070
What's with that look?

269
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,240
What are you going to do

270
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,090
if I get annoyed and put a little
too much strength into my grip?

271
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,340
Neige, beat him to a pulp—

272
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,500
Crap!

273
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,400
Marie!

274
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,920
Everything's okay now!

275
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,770
Thank you, Asta!

276
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,420
Are you okay, Marie?

277
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,800
Hey!

278
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,800
Asta!

279
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,180
You bastard! How dare you
throw something so dangerous?!

280
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,630
What if it had hit Marie?!

281
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,530
Wait, wait, wait. This was to save Marie.

282
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,350
More importantly, what if you had hit Marie?!

283
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,730
There's no way I'd ever hit her.

284
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,310
My love for Marie is too great.

285
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,010
Huh?!

286
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,480
Brother, please stop!

287
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,730
Stay away, Marie!

288
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,770
No!

289
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,700
These children have had their
magic sucked out of them.

290
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,710
If left like this, they may never
be able to use magic again.

291
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,710
Th-Their magic...

292
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,660
That man was saying how it'd
be worth a lot of money.

293
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,380
How could you do something so cruel?

294
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,930
Crap. This is not good. Not good at all.

295
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,930
Baro?

296
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,890
We had enough on our hands
with that monster of a guy,

297
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,190
but now that his friends have
shown up, we don't stand a chance!

298
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,710
This boy...

299
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,480
What the heck? He doesn't
have any magic at all!

300
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,110
Unbelievable! I've never
seen trash like you!

301
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,330
Now that I take a closer look,

302
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,460
you're just some peon that doesn't
even have a Magic Knight's robe!

303
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,380
Neige, you take care of
that sister complex freak.

304
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,460
Huh?

305
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,050
I guess I'll just have to take
care of this peon myself.

306
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,530
I won't...

307
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,790
forgive you!

308
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:39,420
Petit Clover

309
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,670
Petit Clover!

310
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,880
Staying Behind

311
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,610
Staying Behind.

312
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,170
Luca... Marco...

313
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,450
It'll be okay. I'm sure Asta and the
others will bring them back safely.

314
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,430
Why don't we do a quiz to lighten the mood?

315
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,660
Huh?

316
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,860
Then... Where is Asta from?

317
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,690
H-Hage Village.

318
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,030
Correct.

319
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,450
I'll go next.

320
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,410
How old is Asta?

321
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,450
Fifteen, right?

322
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,690
Then when is Asta's birthday?

323
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,530
October 4th.

324
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,420
What is Asta's dream?

325
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Becoming the Wizard King someday... I think.

326
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,430
You're pretty knowledgeable.

327
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,220
You, too.

328
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,150
I really don't want to lose!

329
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,100
Hey, everyone, bah-ha!

330
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,690
Oh, I can't hear you. Ready, and... bah-ha!

331
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,210
Next time, I get to be the star again!

332
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,390
Bah-ha Bah-ha-ho-ha, Page 32:
"Three-Leaf Sprouts."

333
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:54,500
Page 32
Three-Leaf Sprouts

334
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,820
I'll show you the true bah-ha!
