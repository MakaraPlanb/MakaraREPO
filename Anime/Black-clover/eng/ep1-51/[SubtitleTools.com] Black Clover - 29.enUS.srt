1
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,610
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,270
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,610
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,780
The Royal Capital of the Clover Kingdom

5
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,200
Time passed, and the title of Wizard King
has been passed down to the present day,

6
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,330
where the Wizard King still
protects this kingdom

7
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,050
along with his Magic Knights.

8
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,340
The Magic Knights have a total of
nine squads under the Wizard King.

9
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,910
They are squads of mages trained in combat.

10
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,260
The band of heroes who risk their
lives to protect the kingdom,

11
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,250
the Wizard King and the Magic Knights,

12
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,290
are what all citizens of the
Clover Kingdom aspire to be.

13
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,840
Path

14
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,040
Black Bulls' Base

15
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,540
Two thousand nine hundred and ninety-six...
Two thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven...

16
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,050
Two thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight...
Two thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine...

17
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,800
Three thousand!

18
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,800
Training!

19
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm going to train... and train some more!

20
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,470
And I'm going to get stronger and stronger!

21
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,440
So I can become

22
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,610
the Wizard King before him!

23
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,860
I'm going to become the Wizard King

24
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,360
and go back for Sister Lily!

25
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,020
Sister!

26
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,870
Please marry me!

27
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,380
Who would've thought that even Asta
would do so well as a Magic Knight?

28
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,500
I guess it pays to live long.

29
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,770
Fifteen years ago, Asta and Yuno were
abandoned in front of our church, and now...

30
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,090
How they've grown!

31
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,300
Because of the money they send us monthly,

32
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,780
we were able to fix our roof,

33
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,770
and we won't be short on tatoes this winter!

34
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,810
Father...

35
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,100
I apologize.

36
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,890
Thank you.

37
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,380
It's all yours.

38
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,940
Really? Okay.

39
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,330
Magic is everything in this world.

40
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,410
Asta and Yuno that day...

41
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,410
We've never had a Wizard King from this area,

42
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,130
nor anyone who's actually achieved
greatness in the Magic Knights.

43
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,860
I sincerely hope that one of you
will become the Wizard King someday.

44
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,470
Ahem.

45
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,100
Now it's time

46
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,370
for the awarding... of the grimoires!

47
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,280
This is my grimoire?

48
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,370
Yuno received the legendary grimoire
with the four-leaf clover.

49
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,960
I'm going to become the Wizard King.

50
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,920
However, Asta, who had no magic...

51
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,590
Um...

52
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,970
My grimoire's not coming.

53
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,140
Now to down some moguro leaf juice
that I haven't had in a while, since it

54
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,940
supposedly increase magical powers!

55
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,450
Yeah!

56
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,450
What the heck?!

57
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,890
That's actually amazing!

58
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,950
That's way too funny!

59
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,830
What is that grimoire?

60
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,250
That sword!

61
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,550
Just who are you?!

62
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,130
You little wretch with no magical powers!

63
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,810
He... nullified my magic?

64
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,020
Even without magical powers...

65
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm going to become the Wizard King!

66
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,280
Not giving up...

67
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:01,540
is my magic!

68
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,850
Look! Look!

69
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,860
My very own grimoire!

70
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,530
I don't even know how,
but I was able to get one!

71
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,210
Everything turned out all right.

72
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,650
Yuno, Asta... You're the
pride of this village.

73
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,770
There, there...

74
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,780
My Observation Diary of My Very Best Friend, Asta

75
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,290
The first time I encountered Asta was
at the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

76
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,520
He shone from the moment I laid eyes on him.

77
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,230
One of us is going to become the Wizard King.
Our legend's beginning now, Yuno!

78
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,730
I'm gonna show you just how much
I've grown in six months...

79
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,940
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

80
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,270
What the heck are these birds?!

81
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,660
What's with that kid?

82
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,870
Talk about a loser!

83
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,490
That's pretty bad, even for
someone from the boonies.

84
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,080
Get away from me, you stupid birds!

85
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,610
That's...

86
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,000
...one of the captains of
the Magic Knights Squads.

87
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,770
All right. The next exam
shall be the last one.

88
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,390
You will engage in actual combat.

89
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,600
Fighting is our duty.
Show us your true abilities!

90
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,360
I have to stand out by fighting
someone who looks strong.

91
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,610
Bah-ha! Fight me, Asta.

92
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,870
Sekke! You're willing to
fight a loser like me?

93
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's both give it our all and fight fair,
so we can achieve our goals!

94
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,040
Begin!

95
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,410
No holding back, all right?

96
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,090
Let's do this, Asta! Bah-ha!

97
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,100
Bronze Creation Magic:
Sekke Magnum Cannonball!

98
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,180
There's no need to hold back.
Come at me! Bah-ha!

99
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,470
Sure thing.

100
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,030
Here I go.

101
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,050
I'm not joining

102
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:52,000
the Magic Knights so I can have a
good time and avoid working hard.

103
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,670
I'm here to work my butt off
and become the Wizard King!

104
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,680
"So cool."

105
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,680
So cool.

106
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,230
S-So much pressure!

107
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,050
This is...

108
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,240
the magical power of a
Magic Knights Squad captain?

109
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,120
You said earlier that you wanted to
become the Wizard King, didn't you?

110
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,050
Now that I'm standing before you,
do you still have the nerve

111
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,220
to say that you're going
to be the Wizard King,

112
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,460
even without any magical powers?

113
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,720
E-Even if I can't join the
Magic Knights today...

114
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,680
No matter how many times I fall,

115
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,850
no matter what anyone says to me,

116
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,270
I'm still going to become
the Wizard King someday!

117
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,700
You're funny, kid.

118
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,660
Join my squad.

119
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,830
Huh?

120
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,040
I'm telling you that I'll let
you join the Black Bulls.

121
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,880
I wasn't the only one who had realized
Asta's brilliance. The captain had, too.

122
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,410
That's how Asta became a
member of the Black Bulls.

123
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,690
And as for Asta's childhood friend, Yuno...

124
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,480
All who wish to offer,
please raise your hand.

125
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,600
What?

126
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,840
Seriously?

127
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,020
All of the captains...

128
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,200
...raised their hands?!

129
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,350
Th-That's amazing.

130
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,330
I-I thought that only royalty and
nobles could join the Golden Dawn.

131
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,830
All of them! That's amazing!

132
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,090
I'll take the best path to
becoming the Wizard King.

133
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,340
Please allow me to join the Golden Dawn.

134
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,450
Being Asta's childhood friend

135
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,290
would also make him Asta's
best friend's childhood friend.

136
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,830
That would mean Yuno
and I are also best friends.

137
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,110
My Observation Diary of My Very Best Friend's Best Friend, Yuno

138
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,610
Now, then...

139
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,850
I guess I'll write my entry for today.

140
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,410
My dearest friend Asta was
working hard again today.

141
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,050
Scrubbing the floors...

142
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,780
Cleaning...

143
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,220
Doing laundry.

144
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,440
B-But my heart belongs to Sister Lily.

145
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,690
Next!

146
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,690
Taking care of the beasts.

147
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,200
Sit!

148
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,650
There, there. Good boy.

149
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,580
Here.

150
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,520
What the heck are you doing, you jerk?!

151
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,010
Let go of me!

152
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,290
It's hot!

153
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,740
This kind of heat is nothing to
a member of the Black Bulls!

154
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,410
What? You're getting out already?

155
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,090
N-No, not yet! I'm not done yet!

156
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,240
It's hot. I want to add cold water. But...

157
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,740
Hanging out naked really is great.

158
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,000
Ugh, he's so stupid.

159
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,620
Don't you agree, Nero?

160
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,870
He's so reckless.

161
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,380
He's been like that ever
since our first mission.

162
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,880
When we had to hunt that wild boar.

163
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,150
And when we finally got to Saussy Village,
we ended up running into those weirdos.

164
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,280
Hey!

165
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,760
Yes, sir?

166
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,090
This is your execution.

167
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,430
I won't forgive this!

168
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,140
Do you think you can
protect those beasts now?

169
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,150
Asta!

170
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,250
Too slow!

171
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,040
You have no chance of winning.
Why won't you give up?

172
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,040
If I give up, who's going to protect them?

173
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,950
I've realized something.

174
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,670
It's not just because of our promise.

175
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,290
I'm going to become the Wizard King

176
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,390
so I can protect everyone!

177
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,140
Wizard King, my butt!

178
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,320
What does he think would've
happened to him if I wasn't there?

179
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,600
Well, I mean, I guess there have
been times where I thought he

180
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,440
may have actually done a good job.

181
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,160
Wait, no! That's not what I meant!

182
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,320
Why would I care about that
shrimpy little peasant?

183
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,160
I'm a royal!

184
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,160
He's so stupid.

185
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,420
Even in the dungeon...

186
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,030
Your opponent...

187
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,960
is me!

188
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,510
How's that?

189
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,600
Disappear!

190
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,650
What are you doing, Stupidsta?

191
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,570
Noelle...

192
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,030
Hurry up and

193
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,070
defeat that guy, Asta!

194
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,430
Yeah, leave it to me.

195
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,920
I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!

196
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,300
Move. I'm going to make that girl,
that weakling, disappear!

197
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,400
Like hell I'll let that happen!

198
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,560
I don't have any magic,

199
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,220
but I've got...

200
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,670
my friends!

201
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,860
I don't really get it, but I did it!

202
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,120
I messed up...

203
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,630
Asta...

204
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,210
Asta!

205
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,720
I mean, at least he was okay, but...

206
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,930
You saved me. Thanks.

207
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,930
I'm so sorry!

208
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,590
Thanks, Asta. I feel so much better!

209
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,740
Nah. Sorry for ruining the mixer.

210
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,340
It's fine.

211
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,840
Hey, Asta... D-Do you have
anyone that you like?

212
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,670
Yup! There's somebody
I've got my heart set on!

213
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:26,570
If you've got your heart set on me,
don't make me worry so much.

214
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,460
Who are you worried about?

215
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,850
S-S-S-S-S-Stupidsta! How long
have you been standing there?

216
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,900
I just got back from training!

217
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,940
What are you up to, Noelle?

218
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,030
Hmph.

219
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,860
Huh?

220
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,910
Why?!

221
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,100
Hmph!

222
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,860
Tonight's mission will be a bit rough.

223
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,260
I'll do my best!

224
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,590
Is your body back in tip-top shape, Yuno?

225
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,660
If your wounds still haven't healedâ€”

226
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,550
I'm fine.

227
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,770
You're so kind, Klaus.

228
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,970
Nonsense!

229
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,390
Bringing along someone who's
wounded would slow us down.

230
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,390
It's not as though I'm
actually worried about Yuno!

231
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,980
Let's go.

232
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,340
You're not getting on?

233
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,460
Huh? Um...

234
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,470
I was just thinking it'd be nice
to ride on my broom tonight...

235
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,260
There's no reason to hold back.

236
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,260
It won't take that much more
magic to carry you two.

237
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,900
Oh, I'm not holding back.

238
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,540
The thought of not wanting to be
seen on that ship by anyone I know

239
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,740
never crossed my mind.

240
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,810
Not happening.

241
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,510
You bastards! You dare mock my ship?!

242
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,460
I didn't.

243
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,460
Hey! Hold it, Yuno!

244
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,570
You're not allowed to act without permission!

245
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,420
If you'll excuse me, too.

246
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,220
Huh?

247
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,230
I don't have any time to waste.

248
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,980
I need to become stronger.

249
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,330
Stronger...

250
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,410
But you're the one who gave me hope.

251
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,340
Even if you're poor, an orphan...

252
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,070
or even us...

253
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,790
We can become greater than anyone
else in this world. And to prove that...

254
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,830
To make Sister and everyone else happy...

255
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,250
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!

256
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,240
Petit Clover

257
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,090
Petit Clover!

258
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,740
It's Not as Though
I'm Actually Worried

259
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,050
It's Not as Though I'm Actually Worried.

260
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,340
Yes, he's brushing each tooth carefully,
with short strokes, ten to twenty times.

261
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,000
You mustn't scrub so roughly!

262
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,910
The bubbles are heading toward his eye!

263
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,930
Safe!

264
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,760
He's not kicking off his blanket
and getting too cold, is he?

265
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,720
You're so kind, it's almost creepy, Klaus.

266
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,490
Not happening...

267
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,250
We're off work today?

268
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,180
I feel like all we ever do
lately is take time off.

269
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,440
I'm going to play with Rebecca's
younger siblings, then!

270
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,140
Black Clover, Page 30: "The Mirror Mage."

271
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:54,000
Page 30
The Mirror Mage

272
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,610
All right! I'm going to play with all I've got!
