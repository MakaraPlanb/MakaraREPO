1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,690
Not yet. I'm not finished...

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,660
I'm going to be... the Wizard King.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,270
You? The Wizard King?

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,440
I have the ability to find out

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,990
just how much magical power
one has with these chains.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,200
And you have no magic whatsoever.

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,210
You must've been born that way.
No wonder you couldn't get a grimoire.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,760
To think that you lack
even an ounce of magic

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,030
in this world where magic is everything.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,630
What a priceless find!

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,390
Huh?

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,100
What the hell?

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,850
Then no matter how hard I try,
I won't be able to use magic?

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,470
To think that someone so pathetic existed.

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,930
You won't even be able to find a job,
let alone become the Wizard King!

16
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,850
I'm sure your friend, the great
genius over there, mocks you, too.

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,910
Yeah, maybe.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,650
Yuno's so amazing that he
was chosen by the four-leaf.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,540
I'm just...

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,760
You can't do a thing in this world.
Just give up on everything.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,720
You were born a loser!

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,460
He's right.

23
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,770
No matter how hard I try,
some things just can't be helped.

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm just going to give...

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,770
Hey!

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,940
Who are you calling a loser?

27
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,360
Asta, it's true that you won't be
able to become the Wizard King,

28
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,660
no matter what.

29
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,160
You hear that? Even your little friend
is telling you it's impossible.

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,580
That's because I'm going
to become the Wizard King!

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,000
What?

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,840
He's no loser.

33
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,050
He's...

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,140
Asta's my rival!

35
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,230
Huh?

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,130
Him? Your rival?

37
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,480
This brat who has no
magical power whatsoever?

38
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,340
Not... Not yet.

39
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,780
Sorry you had to see me
looking that pathetic, Yuno.

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,410
Just a sec...

41
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,160
I'm gonna kick this guy's butt!

42
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,590
A gri... moire?

43
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,970
I knew it.

44
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,270
There's no way that Asta
wouldn't have been chosen!

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,270
Asta's always been that way.
He always does the unthinkable.

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,230
He always has before...
and he's doing it now.

47
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,040
I'm gonna become the Wizard King...
and protect you and everyone else.

48
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,370
I'm gonna make everyone even happier!
So we can have even nicer things!

49
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,630
And then, I'm gonna prove to everyone...

50
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,960
Prove?

51
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,730
That even if you're poor... or an orphan...

52
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,850
you can still become the Wizard King.

53
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,290
The Boys' Promise

54
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,640
Grey words can't make anything happen

55
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,380
I know, yeah I know

56
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,560
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,640
I dreamed it all my life

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,350
Step by step I go, though
it's a doubtful world 

59
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,450
Don't care how much I fall

60
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,920
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,280
To faraway future, I burst out running

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,680
Go beyond even the unseen fears

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,830
The vision I had, so I can be myself

64
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,090
Someday I will write the next page

65
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,610
You are my hope

66
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,340
Like that page from someday

67
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,680
I was able to meet you

68
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,640
I call this a miracle

69
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,300
10 Years Ago

70
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,790
W-Wait!

71
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,290
Yuno! Are you okay?!

72
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,830
Come on, Yuno.

73
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,180
Asta...

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,670
Jeez. You're such a crybaby, Yuno.

75
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,800
Well...

76
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,700
It's okay!

77
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,820
I've got your back, Yuno! Okay?

78
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,850
Yeah.

79
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,860
All right. Let's get going.

80
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,370
Everyone's waiting at the top!

81
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,710
It's good, but...

82
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,590
It's hard.

83
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,690
That's our Sister Lily.

84
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,650
You're such an amazing cook!

85
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,850
When I grow up, will you
marry me and cook for me?

86
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,990
It was Father who baked those.
Would you like to marry him?

87
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,360
No! You're the one I wanna marry!

88
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,050
Sister! Marry me! Marry me! Marry me!

89
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,460
Marry me! Marry me! Marry me!

90
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,410
Very good.

91
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,210
Asta, it's not possible.

92
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,920
Sister is, um... a woman of the cloth.

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,430
I'm not done yet, Yuno! I won't give up
until I'm an adult, no matter what!

94
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,650
Well, good luck with that.

95
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,750
"And then the world was covered
in deep, deep darkness.

96
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,460
Just when the demon tried
to destroy the world..."

97
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,300
He's not gonna get away with that!

98
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,450
"...a very brave mage appeared.

99
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,960
The brave mage fought the demon
to bring the dawn back to the world.

100
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,190
And finally, he defeated the demon.

101
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,720
The mage's light shone ever so
brightly upon the whole world.

102
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,370
The long, long night had come to an end.

103
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,760
This was the dawn of our world."

104
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,300
Yes!

105
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,900
"And so, the mage was dubbed the
Wizard King and became a legend."

106
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,940
The Wizard King...

107
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,430
"And they all lived happily ever after."

108
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,510
Hey, Sister.

109
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,760
The Wizard King still exists, right?

110
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,260
Yes.

111
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:27,020
The title of "Wizard King" has been passed
down through many generations.

112
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,270
All along, they've been
protecting us with their magic.

113
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,870
It's because of the Wizard King that
the Clover Kingdom is so peaceful.

114
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,830
That's awesome!

115
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,990
Is the Wizard King really important?

116
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,430
He's the most important after the king.

117
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,730
Okay, I've made up my mind!

118
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,220
About what, Asta?

119
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,510
I'm... gonna be the Wizard King!

120
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,850
Sister?

121
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,170
I'm sorry. I just wasn't expecting that.

122
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,810
What brought this on?

123
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,030
Well, he defeated the demon, right?

124
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,850
That means he's super strong!
And that's so cool!

125
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,970
I wanna be cool, too!

126
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,930
And...

127
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,690
If I become important...
If I become the Wizard King,

128
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,380
I'll be able to make everyone
even happier, right?

129
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,050
You'll be able to wear nice clothes
and eat all the good food you want!

130
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,980
I'm gonna make this crappy
little church huge and amazing!

131
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,770
Crappy?

132
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,850
I'll get you whatever you want, too, Sister!

133
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,110
I'll look forward to it.

134
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,280
Right, Yuno?

135
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,780
Yeah.

136
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,090
The Wizard King...

137
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,280
I'm gonna be the Wizard King!

138
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,420
So, Sister! Marry me—

139
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,910
That's a completely different subject.

140
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,450
Not yet! I won't give up!

141
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,300
No.

142
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,140
Not yet, yet, yet, yet!

143
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,090
No.

144
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,510
December

145
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,610
Why?!

146
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,300
Why is it I still can't use magic?!

147
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,780
Sister! I'll hang up the laundry!

148
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,080
Thanks, Asta.

149
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,850
So marry m—

150
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,650
No.

151
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,950
Mar—

152
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,340
Nope.

153
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,200
Mar—

154
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,170
No.

155
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,010
Marry me, please...

156
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,670
Don't you start crying, too, Yuno.

157
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,930
Nash... won't stop crying...

158
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,260
Yuno! Leave this to me!

159
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,020
Asta...

160
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,860
I'm gonna be the Wizard King, after all!

161
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,480
Making a baby or two stop
crying is a piece of cake!

162
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,070
H-Hey! There, there! There, there, there!

163
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,580
There, there.

164
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,060
Way to go, Wizard King.

165
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,540
Shut up.

166
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,110
There we go.

167
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,710
Hi there. I was wondering if one
of you would run an errand for me.

168
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,090
Me! Me! Me! Me, me!

169
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,940
I'll go!

170
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,550
Would someone deliver this to the mayor?

171
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:53,380
Me, me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

172
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,080
It's a very important letter, you see...

173
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,380
Yuno, could you do it?

174
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,360
Huh? Me?

175
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,530
Well, it's a very important letter,

176
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,900
and I'm hesitant to leave it in Asta's
hands, so I'm counting on you.

177
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,820
I have to go see the mayor
in the next village over.

178
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,470
I have to ask him to spare us some
food to make it through the winter.

179
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,120
As it stands now, we just
don't have enough tatoes.

180
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,490
Yuno, I'll go!

181
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,660
No. Father asked me to go.

182
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,880
I-I'll go.

183
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,930
Will you be okay by yourself?

184
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,550
I'll be fine.

185
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,390
I'm heading out!

186
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,930
Come on, Asta. Chop some wood.

187
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,700
You can't use magic, so at
least do some manual labor.

188
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,590
Shut up! Did you even dig up the
tatoes you were supposed to?

189
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,700
I dug up the ones for
today a long time ago.

190
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,780
Huh?!

191
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,970
It looks like it's going
to get chilly tonight.

192
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,090
That's enough! Get out of my shop!

193
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,260
The hell are you doing?!

194
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,460
If you want to drink any more,
you gotta bring some cash.

195
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,650
You ain't getting any for free!

196
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,320
I don't want your stupid
booze anyway, you jerk!

197
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,890
Damn it...

198
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,870
Whoa...

199
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,260
Ow...

200
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,350
The snow's getting pretty thick.
I'll have to be careful not to slip.

201
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,230
Oh, thank you. Please tell
Father that I received it.

202
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,530
I will. P-Please excuse me.

203
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,340
It's late, so be careful getting home!

204
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,610
Thank you very much!

205
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,310
I'm... sorry.

206
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,690
Yuno's taking an awfully long time.

207
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,940
I'm hungry.

208
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,390
And Father isn't back yet, either.

209
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,310
Let's just eat without them.

210
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,580
No! That's not fair to Yuno!

211
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,600
Boo.

212
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,620
My pendant... That's mine...

213
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,280
I'm just gonna exchange it for some cash.

214
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,560
Give it back...

215
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,690
You miserable little brat. Where do you
get off having something this extravagant?

216
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,300
Give it... back...

217
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,780
Give it back...

218
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,150
That's mine...

219
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,810
What the heck is that?

220
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,590
What do you expect to do
to me with magic like that?

221
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,260
You want to fight me...

222
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,140
and die?

223
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,950
Yuno!

224
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,800
Who the hell are you, brat?

225
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,900
That's Yuno's!

226
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,920
Give it back!

227
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,410
Give it back!

228
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,610
Give it back!

229
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,110
Don't touch me with your filthy hands!

230
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,540
You... stupid little brat!

231
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,100
Not yet!

232
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,470
Not yet!

233
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,750
Cut it out!

234
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,940
I'm not done yet!

235
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,170
Damn it!

236
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,570
I'm not done yet!

237
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,770
Damn little brat just won't give up.
What the hell's his problem?

238
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,670
Asta!

239
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,820
I'm sorry. I... I...

240
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't worry about it.

241
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:27,480
I told you, I've got your back.

242
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,330
Asta...

243
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,230
Asta's always done the unthinkable.

244
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,710
Wh-What is that grimoire?

245
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,160
That sword!

246
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,670
Just who are you?!

247
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,960
You little wretch with no magical powers!

248
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,910
He... nullified my magic?

249
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,800
Even without magical powers...

250
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,360
I'm going to become the Wizard King!

251
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,870
Not giving up...

252
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:31,150
is my magic!

253
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,480
I built up my muscles
since I couldn't use any magic.

254
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,390
Looks like they came in handy after all.

255
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,280
Asta...

256
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,750
Asta, are you okay?

257
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,140
I'm so sorry. It's all
my fault... I'm sorry...

258
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,000
This is nothin'!

259
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,600
I'm gonna become the Wizard King.

260
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,600
I'm gonna become the Wizard King...
and protect you and everyone else.

261
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,890
I'm gonna make everyone even happier!
So we can have even nicer things!

262
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,210
And then, I'm gonna prove to everyone...

263
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,240
Prove?

264
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,330
That even if you're poor... or an orphan...

265
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,370
you can still become the Wizard King.

266
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,400
We can?

267
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,710
Yeah.

268
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,700
Can we really?

269
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,720
Anyone can... if they work hard enough!

270
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,390
Anyone?

271
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,390
Me, or even you, Yuno!

272
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,390
I'll... never cry again.

273
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,420
Maybe I... no...

274
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,410
Yuno?

275
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,000
I will...

276
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,660
I'll become the Wizard King, too!

277
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,480
I'll get stronger, and protect
you and everyone else!

278
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,340
I'm gonna make everyone happier!
So we can have nicer things!

279
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,500
Yuno! Look, look! I got my own grimoire!

280
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,590
It's insanely shabby, but I'm gonna take
good care of it for the rest of my life!

281
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,950
There, there, there, there, there.
There, there, there, there.

282
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,950
I guess...

283
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,580
you saved me again.

284
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,450
I'll repay you for this someday.

285
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,950
Asta...

286
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,310
Do you remember our promise?

287
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,460
So you're gonna become the Wizard King, too?

288
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,290
That means...

289
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,190
Yuno, you're...

290
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,290
Asta, you're...

291
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,940
...my rival!

292
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,890
You mean you remember it?

293
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,870
I thought you were just making fun of me.

294
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,650
I have no interest in being
too friendly with my rival.

295
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,570
But you're the one who gave me hope.

296
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,450
Even if you're poor, an orphan...

297
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,190
or even us...

298
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,910
We can become greater than anyone
else in this world. And to prove that...

299
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,950
To make Sister and everyone else happy...

300
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,960
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!

301
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,840
No one can escape from here

302
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:21,590
Once again in the small closed off classroom

303
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:29,820
The star of the class was shining yet again

304
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:36,280
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

305
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,710
I've thought many times

306
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,420
That the revolution was within my hands

307
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:51,020
Isn't it strange? If you want
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

308
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:57,850
The rest of us who were left
behind wanted to become something

309
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:05,110
We repeat the same morning over and over

310
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:11,990
You're the only one who
can choose your tomorrow

311
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,720
Let's go beyond our current selves

312
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,860
Even though I can't use magic,
I'm going to join the Magic Knights!

313
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,270
So that I can become the Wizard King!

314
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,900
Black Clover, Page 3: "To the Royal
Capital of the Clover Kingdom!"

315
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:55,250
Page 3
To the Royal Capital of the Clover Kingdom!

316
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,820
Not giving up is my magic!
