1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,700
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,530
Go! Go! First Mission

5
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,710
Grey words can't make anything happen

6
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,420
I know, yeah I know

7
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,630
Wishing to fly freely across the sky

8
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,670
I dreamed it all my life

9
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,470
Step by step I go, though
it's a doubtful world 

10
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,520
Don't care how much I fall

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,990
Instinct is my guide, I never give up

12
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,480
To faraway future, I burst out running

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,490
Go beyond even the unseen fears

14
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,870
The vision I had, so I can be myself

15
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,120
Someday I will write the next page

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,620
You are my hope

17
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,380
Like that page from someday

18
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,710
I was able to meet you

19
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,670
I call this a miracle

20
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,770
Mornings start early for Magic Knights.

21
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,480
There are many things they must do.

22
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,620
Cleaning.

23
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,450
Laundry.

24
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,260
But my heart belongs to Sister Lily.

25
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,430
Next!

26
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,440
The Beasts' Room

27
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,900
Taking care of the beasts.

28
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,710
Sit!

29
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,650
There, there. Good boy.

30
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,580
Here.

31
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,000
You must endure, even if you're
almost eaten by a beast. And...

32
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,010
In Front of the Captain's Room

33
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,010
Captain Yami...

34
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,010
Captain...

35
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,430
You must wake up the captain of
the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro.

36
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,770
Captain! It's morning!

37
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,270
Don't wake me up! I'll kill you!

38
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,770
Sorry about that!

39
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,590
Even though you're the one who told me
to wake you up every morning!

40
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,030
Magic Knights must also deal with
unreasonable demands.

41
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,580
Man, I've been working hard
since the crack of dawn again.

42
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,290
Magic Knights sure have a lot of work to do.

43
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,780
Wait, how is this any different from
what I was doing at the church?!

44
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,450
What are Magic Knights
supposed to do anyway?!

45
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,680
Cafeteria

46
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,190
There's nothing but meat for breakfast.

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,530
Noelle, why don't you help me
with the cleaning and stuff?

48
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,970
Cleaning? But I'm royalty.

49
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,630
But you're a newbie just like me!

50
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,440
I've never cleaned or
done laundry in my life.

51
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,170
That's not something to brag about, is it?

52
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,940
We're in the same squad, aren't we?

53
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm pretty sure you should
be helping with that stuff.

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,890
But I'm royalty.

55
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,240
Why are you talking to me like that?

56
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,530
Shut up, you insect.

57
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,130
Damn it!

58
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,250
So, uh...

59
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,650
What do Magic Knights do anyway?

60
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,010
What? Are you seriously asking that?

61
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,680
We protect the kingdom and handle security!

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,740
It's the most manly job
in the world, you dumbass!

63
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,550
Why'd you decide to join
when you knew nothing about it?

64
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm sorry!

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,200
I'm going to become the Wizard King.

66
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,420
I'm going to barf everything back up!

67
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,620
They sure are lively first
thing in the morning.

68
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,120
Being energetic is the best.
Can I have some of that energy?

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,710
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

70
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,670
Damn it. Show 'em what Magic Knights do,

71
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,380
you drunk witch.

72
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,520
Well...

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,210
We keep the citizens safe? Something like that.

74
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,310
You might even be able to get closer to some
noble when you're assigned to protect them.

75
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,530
I see!

76
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,590
It's a super-fun job where you get
to fight with enemies all you want.

77
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,460
If they're criminals, you can beat them up
all you want and not get in trouble!

78
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,120
Most importantly, it's a wonderful job
that my sister respects me for having.

79
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,870
Isn't she an angel? I can buy her
whatever she wants with my pay.

80
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,590
But if you lay a finger
on Marie, I'll kill you.

81
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,990
Wh-What about you, Finral?

82
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,510
It's the best job in the world,
since I get to save girls and be popular.

83
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,350
Of course I'll tell you.
We're friends, after all.

84
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,450
Charmy?

85
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm... out of food!

86
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,690
I'm nowhere near full.

87
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,040
Cotton Creation Magic: Sheep Cooks!

88
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,610
Thank you for the food!

89
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,870
As long as you're a Magic Knight,
you can eat plenty of food!

90
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,000
Munchy...

91
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,700
Uh, Grey?

92
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,450
Huh?!

93
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,570
Well, basically, it's a good job.

94
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,830
He looks just like you.

95
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,670
I'm looking forward to working
with you on a mission.

96
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,380
R-Right...

97
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,090
Th-They're all weirdos.

98
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,010
Should I really be in this squad?

99
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:36,710
If you take this and this, and put them
together and do this, it's really yummy.

100
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,790
Try a bite? 'Kay?

101
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,810
No, I'm full, thanks.

102
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,230
Well? Do you understand
what Magic Knights do now?

103
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,240
Not at all!

104
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,870
Let's go, Magna.

105
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,960
Yes, sir, Mister Yami!

106
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,660
What's going on? What's going on?

107
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,140
There's a mission.

108
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,500
A Magic Knights' mission?

109
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,690
C-Can I come with—

110
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,640
No!

111
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,310
We can't bring any kids along.

112
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,110
This is a very important mission for adults.

113
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,970
All right. We're off.

114
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,610
Hey! Don't break everything while we're gone.

115
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,450
Okay! Have fun!

116
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,470
Captain! Will you fight me
when you come back?

117
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,200
Come back soon. I'll be waiting.

118
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,880
Come back by dinner! Munchy...

119
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,170
Can I go see Marie soon?

120
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,510
I'm having withdrawal symptoms.

121
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,970
Maybe I'll go flirt...

122
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,690
I mean, go on a mission, too.

123
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,350
Should I really be in this squad?

124
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,630
Captain Yami and Magna
both looked so serious.

125
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,150
What kind of mission could it be?

126
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,210
This is bad...

127
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,830
This is really bad!

128
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,350
And now you're both...

129
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,350
finished!

130
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,290
And now you're both...

131
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,290
finished!

132
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,530
Flush!

133
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,710
Two pair.

134
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,710
I've got nothing!

135
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,750
You got me!

136
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,220
This feels great!

137
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,900
Damn it! That's six months worth of pay.

138
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,170
You've still got a ways to go,
Magna. You, too, Captain!

139
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,100
Good! Very good!

140
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,110
Now I can buy some great gifts for
everyone in the village on my way home.

141
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,890
Let's go another round.

142
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,700
Mister Yami?

143
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,860
Oh? But you don't have
anything else to bet, do you?

144
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,340
You don't have any clothes or cash.

145
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,930
Yeah! We're basically naked!

146
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,110
No, there's still more.

147
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,420
Hey, gramps.

148
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,590
Let's do one last round.
If we win, we get everything back.

149
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,550
Oh, and if you lose?

150
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,850
This!

151
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,470
M-Mister Yami! That's...

152
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,230
So let's do another round!

153
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,090
Er, you probably shouldn't be betting that.

154
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,730
Yeah, Mister Yami!

155
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,820
Shut up!

156
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,280
Use this moment to go beyond your limits!

157
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,940
But you know...

158
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,940
All right. If you lose,
how about you do anything I ask?

159
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,370
Anything?

160
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,680
Anything? Of course Mister Yami
would never accept...

161
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,050
I accept.

162
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,620
Mister Yami accepted! I'm in!

163
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,450
Old Man Seihi, say your prayers!

164
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,520
I wonder who'll be saying their prayers...

165
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,670
This could work!

166
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,860
Shoot!

167
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,620
There, there. Good boy.

168
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,540
Here.

169
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,580
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

170
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,200
Hey! Don't just stand there! Help me!

171
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,030
I'm royalty.

172
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,250
You should be thankful that
I even got out of bed.

173
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,790
How?! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

174
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,010
I thought I was going to die.

175
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,810
You really are freakishly strong.

176
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,680
Well, I train!

177
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,180
Captain Yami and Magna...

178
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,880
I wonder if they finished their... mission?!

179
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,690
What?

180
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,200
That old man actually had
a royal straight flush!

181
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,490
Who would've thought? He's amazing!

182
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,380
We're no match for Old Man Seihi!

183
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,500
People sure are strong when they
have something on the line.

184
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,350
Hey, Stupidsta, Lady Noe, we're back!

185
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,340
Be happy! You two are going on
your first mission

186
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,650
as Magic Knights.

187
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,590
Huh?

188
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,680
And so, we're giving you your first mission.

189
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,230
Our first mission...

190
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,450
...as Magic Knights.

191
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,980
Wh-What is it?

192
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,480
It had better be something
worthy of me as a royal.

193
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,870
Yeah, you should be honored.

194
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,670
You'll be hunting wild boars
in Saussy Village!

195
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,630
Wild...

196
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,870
...boars?

197
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,620
Boar!

198
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,380
Wh-What in the world is this lame mission?

199
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,710
What are you calling lame?!

200
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,430
I can beat a wild boar with my bare hands!

201
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,970
Don't you dare underestimate wild boars!

202
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,530
They come charging outta nowhere!

203
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,730
Haven't you ever heard
the phrase "rushing into things"?!

204
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,110
We both ended up losing to
the mayor of Saussy Village.

205
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,280
Huh?

206
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,220
C-Captain Yami and Magna lost?

207
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,660
Just how strong is he?

208
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,600
It was cards.

209
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,660
Cards?!

210
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,710
He basically stripped us of all we had.

211
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,410
And six months worth of pay, too!

212
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,020
Why...

213
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,920
...are you bragging?

214
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,620
And we ended up promising him
we'd do anything if we lost,

215
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,730
so he asked us to take care
of some wild boars for him.

216
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,260
Apparently, a herd showed up near
the village, and they're ruining the fields.

217
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,020
Well, I'll be waiting at my village.

218
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,400
Oh, I'll at least return these to you.

219
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,610
Hi, question! That has nothing
to do with us, right?

220
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,580
Yeah! You two are the ones who lost! Then...

221
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,090
You idiots! You're asking Mister Yami
to clean up his own mistakes?!

222
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,420
Normally...

223
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,880
...you would.

224
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,710
We're the ones who clean up
Mister Yami's mistakes!

225
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,520
Are you going to go, or are you going to die?

226
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,690
Which will it be?

227
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,690
We'll go!

228
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,210
Even though we're hunting wild boars,
this is our first mission as Magic Knights.

229
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,310
I'm so excited!

230
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,930
I'm supposed to get rid of wild boars?

231
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,580
What? You're still complaining?

232
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,090
I'm not complaining, but...

233
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,940
I was just wondering if I should go,
since I can't control my magical powers.

234
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,970
You idiot!

235
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,930
What...

236
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,180
You'll be able to fix that in no time
with some missions under your belt!

237
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,430
And...

238
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,850
I'll be sure to clean up any of you
newbies' mistakes, since I'm your senior.

239
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,040
Magna, you're such a manly man!

240
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,650
Stop it, Stupidsta. You're making me blush.

241
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:00,440
I-If you insist, I guess
I could accompany you.

242
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,590
Thank you very much!

243
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,090
Wait. Why are you always looking down on us?!

244
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm not. It's just that
you're always below me.

245
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,510
What kind of reasoning is that?!

246
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,970
So...

247
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,220
Use your spatial magic to
get us to Saussy Village.

248
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,790
Saussy Village?

249
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,560
Not happening.

250
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,620
What do you mean, you jerk?!

251
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,370
Well, I can only go to
faraway places I can't see

252
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,490
if I've marked them
with my magical powers.

253
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,670
Huh?!

254
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,820
Meaning I can't go to places
I've never been to before.

255
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,430
You're so useless!

256
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,620
Guess we don't have a choice.
We'll go by broomstick.

257
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,580
Magna, sir!

258
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,640
Yeah, Asta?

259
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,220
I can't fly on a broomstick!

260
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,070
Sir.

261
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,300
Yes, Noelle?

262
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,420
I can't, either.

263
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,260
What?! Are you two serious?!

264
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,790
Why can't you do something
so easy, you morons?!

265
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,400
Damn it! That's as basic as it gets!

266
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,810
Well, I don't have any magical powers!

267
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,710
Why are you bragging about that?!

268
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,410
Well, I can't control my magical powers,
so of course I can't. You fool.

269
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,660
And why do you sound so high and mighty?!

270
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,210
Guess I don't have a choice.

271
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,340
I'll give you two a ride on my baby.

272
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,840
Baby?

273
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,840
Her name's...

274
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,110
Crazy Cyclone!

275
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,600
Crazy Cyclone

276
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,180
S-So cool!

277
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,480
I know, right?! Isn't she a beaut?

278
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,420
Yeah, she is!

279
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,170
Lame.

280
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,890
What?! Are you not able to
comprehend her majestic form?

281
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,820
So lame!

282
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,810
Let's go!

283
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,800
Are you going to be all right?

284
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,460
A man never goes back on his word!

285
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,640
Here we go!

286
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,390
Fly!

287
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,340
How do you like that?
Crazy Cyclone can even handle three riders!

288
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,290
Hey! Fly a bit more steady!

289
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,650
H-H-Hey! Don't get so close to me!

290
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,580
You can't be serious,
you mohawked delinquent!

291
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,290
Who are you calling a mohawked delinquent?!

292
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,470
Yahoo!

293
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,180
This is amazing, Magna!
We're one with the wind!

294
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,420
And if you don't want to die,
get a little closer, Stupidsta!

295
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,300
Yes, sir!

296
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,490
Hey! Where are you touching me?!

297
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,230
What the hell are you two doing?!

298
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,950
Saussy Village

299
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,940
Right on schedule.

300
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,100
So this is where the magic stone is located.

301
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,050
We're going to find it.

302
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,980
Yes, sir!

303
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,110
Be lost in the mist.

304
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:56,640
No one can escape from here

305
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:03,390
Once again in the small closed off classroom

306
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:11,640
The star of the class was shining yet again

307
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:18,080
They shine so bright that I close my eyes

308
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,520
I've thought many times

309
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,230
That the revolution was within my hands

310
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:32,820
Isn't it strange? If you want
to laugh, go ahead and laugh

311
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:39,670
The rest of us who were left
behind wanted to become something

312
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:46,920
We repeat the same morning over and over

313
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:53,810
You're the only one who
can choose your tomorrow

314
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,520
Let's go beyond our current selves

315
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:17,370
Petit Clover

316
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,970
Petit Clover!

317
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,870
Regards!

318
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,040
Regards!

319
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,750
Well? Isn't Crazy Cyclone super cool?

320
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,010
Actually, I'd probably call your head
a crazy cyclone before I would your broom.

321
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,560
Who are you calling a cyclone?!

322
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,220
Apparently, you're okay with "crazy."

323
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,810
We came here to hunt wild boars,
but end up encountering a crazy enemy.

324
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,140
I'm not going to forgive you for
causing everyone so much trouble!

325
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,810
Black Clover, Page 9: "Beasts."

326
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:55,250
Page 9
Beasts

327
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,740
Not giving up is my magic!
