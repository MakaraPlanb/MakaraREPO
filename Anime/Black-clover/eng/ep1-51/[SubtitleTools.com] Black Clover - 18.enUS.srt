1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,670
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,850
Hey, come on! Are you
finished already, you jerk?

5
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,450
Asta!

6
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,760
What...

7
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,370
are you?

8
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,140
I'm someone who was born without any magic!

9
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,580
But even so, I'm going to
become the Wizard King!

10
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,400
And I'm alive...

11
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,850
to prove that!

12
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,240
Mars!

13
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,050
What do you want to be when you grow up?

14
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,370
I'm...

15
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,750
I'm just going to destroy everything!

16
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,000
Destroy everything?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,850
The Wizard King protects everyone!

18
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,010
We were born to protect
everyone in this country.

19
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,260
Like hell I'm going to lose
to someone like you!

20
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,770
You're in my way...

21
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,810
Begone, pebble!

22
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,560
I may be just a pebble,

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,060
but I'm...

24
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,990
a pebble that shatters diamonds!

25
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,810
I would always close my eyes

26
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,010
And cower at reality

27
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,770
I can't stand the idea

28
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,170
Of just making excuses to give up

29
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,090
Stand right there

30
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,400
I don't want to be near you

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,570
Any minute now

32
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,930
Just wait right there

33
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,930
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

34
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,090
Black and blue

35
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,990
I'll give up on giving up

36
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,150
And get the world on my side

37
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,820
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,150
Every time somewhere under this sky

39
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,180
Break through the tearful nights

40
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,460
And head where the light shines

41
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,290
I want to keep my promise

42
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,840
I'll deliver it to you

43
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,820
shape of love

44
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,560
Memories of You

45
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,030
That should do it.

46
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,480
Is this actually going
to keep him restrained?

47
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,590
Of course it is!

48
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,790
My magic is not so weak that it'd
be broken by someone who's injured.

49
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,220
Look! We've taken his grimoire, too.

50
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,790
Don't get so pissy.

51
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,720
Want some medicinal herbs?

52
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,600
I don't want your leftovers!

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,550
What about you, Yuno?

54
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,350
Not a chance.

55
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,840
I'm glad that you're all safe.

56
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,930
Should you be moving around now?

57
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,300
It's fine. I feel much better.

58
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,880
It's all because you protected me, Noelle.

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,440
I-I didn't protect you.

60
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,370
You're just so helpless that
I couldn't leave you alone.

61
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,990
Right. Thank you very much.

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,330
M-More importantly, Asta,
do something about your clothes!

63
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,840
Well, what am I supposed to do?

64
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,280
Aren't you embarrassed?

65
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,660
Why are you the one turning red?

66
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,110
I'm not turning red!

67
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,840
Actually...

68
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,640
My robe's ripped to shreds...

69
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,340
Magna's gonna kill me.

70
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,850
Vanessa will fix it for you when we get back.

71
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,840
Well, that's good, I guess.

72
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,810
To think that we'd be saved
by the Black Bulls...

73
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,910
We were the first ones to arrive,
therefore we win this competition,

74
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,710
but I will allow you three to enter
the treasure chamber, also.

75
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,880
Why do you always sound
so arrogant, four-eyes?

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,490
Well, thank you very much, you jerk!

77
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,510
You're very welcome!
Watch how you speak to me!

78
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,470
Well, excuse me, Lord Four-Eyes!

79
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,240
Who are you calling "Lord Four-Eyes"?!

80
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,210
Hmph! I don't have time to argue with you!

81
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,310
Well, excuse me, Lord Four-Eyes!

82
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,520
Shut your mouth!

83
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,650
They sure like wasting each other's time.

84
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,180
Keep it up and I'll break
those glasses of yours!

85
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,840
That's just cruelty!

86
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,650
I wouldn't say that, Lord Four-Eyes!

87
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,660
That's enough!

88
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,490
Let us head to the treasure chamber!

89
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,780
Yeah!

90
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,880
It'll be the Clover Kingdom's Magic Knights
who get to the treasure chamber!

91
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,830
You're so annoying!

92
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,280
You're the one who's annoying!

93
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,180
How do you get in?

94
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,070
There must be some code to
open this door somewhere.

95
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,750
You can do it! Think harder, four-eyes!

96
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,930
Shut up! Stop calling me that!

97
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,040
My name is Klaus!

98
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,260
It appears this door is made with magic,
so just cut through it.

99
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,120
Like, swoosh.

100
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,800
All right!

101
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,720
There's no way you can open it.

102
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,640
Yes!

103
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,390
That's awesome!

104
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,250
It's a mountain of treasure!

105
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,620
Hey! Be careful!

106
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,830
Heya, Asta.

107
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,550
Luck popped out!

108
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,270
It's beautiful.

109
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,790
I wonder what you use this for.
I haven't the slightest idea.

110
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,440
All of you! Stop touching
things without permission!

111
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,280
They might be magical items
worthy of being national treasures!

112
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,670
A little bit won't hurt, crabbypants.

113
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,040
Who are you calling "crabbypants"?!

114
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,530
Then we'll just go back to "four-eyes."

115
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,890
Stop calling me that!

116
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,250
Then "glasses man."

117
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,290
You bastard!

118
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,030
See? You are a crabbypants!

119
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,050
You think that makes you clever or something?!

120
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,820
What are these symbols?
I've never seen them before.

121
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,430
The symbols...

122
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,740
What was that just now?

123
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,970
No idea.

124
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,150
Don't go around touching things.

125
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,850
Put that back.

126
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,130
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

127
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,160
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Stop!
You're gonna tear it out, Nero!

128
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,990
Hey!

129
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,390
What about it?

130
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,960
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

131
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,640
But this is a rather rare,
strange grimoire.

132
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,850
It's as though it's stitched together.

133
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,720
Well...

134
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,480
We have a four-leaf clover,

135
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,740
and a grimoire so filthy
you can't even read it.

136
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,310
I have three oddities on my hands.

137
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,820
Isn't there anything interesting here?

138
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,240
This power...

139
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,500
Everyone, run!

140
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,730
I-Impossible!

141
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,910
My restraining magic...
And in so little time...

142
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,490
How could he have revived?!

143
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,490
Th-That's...

144
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,240
Flame recovery magic? That's impossible!

145
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,250
Everyone should have only
one magical attribute!

146
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:39,030
Mages have mana from the four classical
elements: fire, wind, water, and earth.

147
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:52,060
Fire

148
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:52,060
Wind

149
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:52,060
Water

150
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:52,060
Earth

151
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,320
Fire is strong against wind,
and weak against water.

152
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,680
There are compatibilities
between each element.

153
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Mages can only use magic
from their own mana or

154
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,930
from a single attribute derived from it.

155
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,110
He's breaking all of those laws to have
two different kinds of magic!

156
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,640
Not to mention, he was clearly
a user of offensive magic,

157
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,480
but now he's using recovery magic!

158
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,790
That's inconceivable!

159
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,880
Are these the results of the
Diamond Kingdom's experiments?!

160
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,620
I'm sure you'll become a great warrior, Mars.

161
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,460
I'm sorry, Mars.

162
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,310
I have no other choice.

163
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,390
Please die.

164
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,660
I'll put that fire out!

165
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,230
Noelle!

166
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Noelle!

167
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,910
Noelle!

168
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,800
You bastard!

169
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,510
How dare you do that to my friend?!

170
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,070
I know your abilities now.

171
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,210
If that blade is able to cut
through various magics,

172
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,630
then what about magic that's
faster than your blade?

173
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,570
So fast!

174
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,530
How dare you do that to my friend?!

175
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,140
Mars!

176
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,110
The strong will survive,
and the weak will die.

177
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,840
Noelle!

178
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,360
The strong will survive...

179
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,250
Noelle!

180
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,380
Hey, you idiot! Get a hold of yourself!

181
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,630
The Dream-Healing Flower
Cradle won't be fast enough!

182
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,770
Plant Recovery Magic:
Princess-Healing Flower Robe!

183
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,980
Noelle...

184
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,610
This is the strongest
spell I can use right now.

185
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,870
Please don't die,

186
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,290
Noelle!

187
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,420
Ow...

188
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,170
What are you doing, Mimosa?

189
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,580
Honestly, you're so slow.

190
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,930
Here.

191
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,430
Thanks, Noelle.

192
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,940
That's amazing, Mimosa!

193
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,000
Who knew you'd be able to use
recovery magic that's this powerful?

194
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,540
With your royal magic, you may become
a healer who can heal any injury.

195
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,760
This is exciting.

196
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,960
On the other hand...

197
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,960
There's the House of Silva's second daughter,
who can't even control her powers.

198
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,300
I hear she's training every day.

199
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,460
Who knew someone like that
would be born into royalty?

200
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,240
I guess we Vermillions are the true royalty.

201
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,650
I might've just given up
if I were in her shoes...

202
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,510
Royals mock hard work.

203
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,230
It's something only those who
aren't born into power do,

204
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,420
not something that royalty does.

205
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
But...

206
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,900
I admire you for the hard work you do.

207
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,840
The strong will survive,
and the weak will die.

208
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,920
The strong will survive,
and the weak will die.

209
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,430
If only I could use my grimoire...

210
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,970
My sword...

211
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,690
Noelle... Mimosa...

212
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,370
With my big, heavy sword, I won't
be able to beat his magic's speed.

213
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,520
He changed the way he fights,
and the magic he uses while doing it.

214
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,000
What am I supposed to...

215
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,960
Nero?

216
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,940
Please die.

217
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,200
The strong will survive...

218
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,200
and the weak...

219
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,640
Mimosa!

220
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,410
What is that sword?

221
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,310
This sword will work.

222
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,890
Your opponent...

223
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,230
is me!

224
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,620
How's that?

225
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,120
Disappear!

226
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,890
Even if I can cut through his attack magic,
as long as he has that recovery magic,

227
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,860
I won't be able to finish him off!

228
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,770
What should I do?

229
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,890
What are you doing, Stupidsta?

230
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,770
Noelle!

231
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,790
Noelle...

232
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,860
You're the first peasant...

233
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,070
that I, a royal, ever acknowledged.

234
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,490
Hurry up and

235
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,950
defeat that guy, Asta!

236
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,640
Yeah, leave it to me.

237
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,140
I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!

238
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,910
Move. I'm going to make that girl,
that weakling, disappear!

239
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,050
Like hell I'll let that happen!

240
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,120
I don't have any magic,

241
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,150
but I've got...

242
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,340
my friends!

243
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,660
This is nothing!

244
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:36,420
Wh-What just happened? He's not
supposed to have any magic!

245
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,330
A water magic attack?

246
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,180
He borrowed Noelle's powers?

247
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,260
What in the world is that sword?

248
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,410
I don't really get it, but I did it!

249
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,290
I messed up...

250
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,650
Asta...

251
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,730
Asta!

252
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

253
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,570
And push me forward

254
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,610
(I can't find a place to go)

255
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

256
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:05,390
And change the flow of time

257
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,810
(I will keep believing in you)

258
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,690
In this ever-vivid place

259
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,640
(Break free yourself)

260
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

261
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,190
If there is a path that I should choose

262
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

263
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,160
Wherever it may lead us

264
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,650
Until my life comes to an end

265
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

266
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

267
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

268
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

269
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

270
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,270
Petit Clover

271
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,930
Petit Clover!

272
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,770
Resilient

273
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,610
Resilient.

274
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,780
Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.

275
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,280
Isn't it hot in there?

276
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,540
It is.

277
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,540
Isn't it heavy?

278
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,750
It is.

279
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,050
And...

280
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,100
My face itches, but I can't scratch it!

281
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,650
The strong will survive,
and the weak will die.

282
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,020
Pebbles on the side of the road,
disperse in the wind.

283
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,400
Black Clover, Page 19:
"Destruction and Salvation."

284
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:55,250
Page 19
Destruction and Salvation

285
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,700
My magic destroys all.
