1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,170
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,140
Granny! Get a grip!

5
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,150
Don't you dare die, you old hag!

6
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,300
You're going to make Marie sad if you die!

7
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,990
I wouldn't like it very much, either!

8
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,370
T-Take care of the children for me...

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:14,980
In any battlefield... the victims
were... always the weak.

10
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,640
It was always the innocent children.

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,900
It's because I wanted to protect the children

12
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,150
that I left the battlefield
and became a sister.

13
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,360
Granny!

14
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,520
What are you talking about?

15
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,280
All of you were born sinners.

16
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,370
What?!

17
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,880
You poor thing... Sally, look at
how much they've hurt you.

18
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,130
Master Licht...

19
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,380
Rest, my child.

20
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,840
Valtos.

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,780
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,230
See you later, Asta.

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,730
You belong to me.

24
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,230
I never want to see her again!

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,740
Forgive me, my lord. All this
because I let her go alone...

26
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,990
I never imagined all of this would happen.

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,530
There's no need for you to feel responsible.

28
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm sure they used some underhanded methods.

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,200
Who are you calling underhanded?!

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,420
Look at what you did to all
those innocent children!

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,050
She mentioned earlier that the victims
on the battlefield are always the weak.

32
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,010
That is incorrect.

33
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,510
The victims are the strong.

34
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,020
Envied, feared, discriminated
against, persecuted, and...

35
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,640
stolen from.

36
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,030
What is he talking about?

37
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,730
That is why we will not
forgive the Clover Kingdom.

38
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,910
This time, we will destroy you
and create our own kingdom.

39
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,960
What the hell are you even talking about?!

40
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,960
You're the ones who attacked first, you jerk!

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,380
Shut your filthy mouth.

42
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,640
You're an eyesore.

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Why does someone like you have that grimoire?

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Grimoire?

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,150
Damn it... I can't see his attacks at all!

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,070
They hit me straight-on
at an incredible speed!

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,680
What do I...

48
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,550
This is the only way.

49
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,170
If I use my sword as a shield and charge
at him, I can avoid a fatal injury!

50
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,830
I'm not done yet!

51
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,580
That won't work.

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,790
I'll be taking that grimoire back.

53
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,250
I'm gonna...

54
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,760
di—

55
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,600
Seriously?

56
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,850
Captain Yami! What are you doing here?

57
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,360
Why am I here? Well, obviously...

58
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,520
I'm a little lost. Give me
some directions, damn it.

59
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,800
Light Magic vs. Dark Magic

60
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,580
Captain, you were lost?!

61
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,340
Of course not, you moron.

62
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,460
I was joking, dumbass.

63
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,410
What?!

64
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,300
We're Magic Knights. Of course
we're going to show up.

65
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,460
Everyone back at the base was useless,
so I decided to come myself.

66
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,360
I'll kill them all later.

67
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,320
What the heck are they doing when
we're in this much trouble?!

68
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,320
He dragged me out of bed,
and now we're in this mess!

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,320
By the way, didn't I tell
you to take the day off?

70
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,960
Want me to give you a permanent vacation?

71
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,740
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

72
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,380
So, what's his deal?

73
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,690
Apparently he's the leader of
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

74
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,080
Th-The Eye of the Midnight Sun?!

75
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,090
Oh?

76
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,110
I thought he'd be some big, burly guy
who could eat a cow in a single gulp,

77
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,720
but he's just a scrawny-ass beanpole.

78
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,180
Um, I'm pretty sure muscles
don't really matter.

79
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,730
What's with that guy's creepy,
infinite amount of magic?!

80
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,760
Not to mention, he uses light magic?

81
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,940
That's a super rare magic
that only a few people

82
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,860
throughout the history of the
Clover Kingdom have ever used!

83
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,870
Without a doubt, he's super
dangerous! I wanna go home!

84
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,370
That's the Black Bulls' captain.

85
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,800
Shall I summon the Third Eye?

86
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,630
There's no need.

87
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,920
I've always wanted to fight him,
since he uses dark magic.

88
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,970
Finral, please get the kids and
everyone else back to town.

89
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,850
Sure, leave it to me!

90
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,110
What are you going to do?

91
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,140
I can still fight!

92
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,520
I finally get a chance to see Captain Yami
in action! There's no way I'm leaving!

93
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,450
Gauche and, uh... you there! Can you walk?

94
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,950
More importantly, get to
the old hag! Hurry up!

95
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,030
Got it!

96
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,830
I've been around longer than you, y'know...

97
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,250
All right, Yami. I'm leaving the rest to you.

98
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,170
Hey. You better come back.

99
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,440
Gulp...

100
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,920
I was planning to just
stay out of harm's way.

101
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,170
You know, I think I'm running low on magic...

102
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,760
Like, for real!

103
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,080
What do you mean? I'm for real, too.

104
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,140
Of course you are...

105
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,650
Huh?

106
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,190
The hell do you think
you're doing to my ride?

107
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,780
Ride?!

108
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,780
Yeesh! I don't have enough
lives to stick around here!

109
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,110
Well, see you, Yami!

110
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,290
You better come back, damn it!

111
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,040
So cool! How'd you stop that?

112
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,900
What's up with that sword?!

113
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,500
Shut up, brat.

114
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,220
This is a weapon called a "katana"
from my homeland, the Land of the Sun.

115
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,350
And that was—

116
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,590
Like I have time to explain all this
right now. Besides, it's a pain.

117
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,390
Just watch!

118
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,600
Light Magic: Light Swords of Conviction.

119
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,440
Awesome!

120
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,230
He's boosting his physical abilities
with reinforcing magic

121
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,950
and cutting my light magic with
a sword cloaked in dark magic.

122
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,200
But that's not all.

123
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,370
How about this, then?

124
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,880
So this is the power of the
great Magic Knight heretic.

125
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,470
Huh?

126
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,890
Hey, have I met you somewhere before?

127
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,480
I'm pretty sure I don't know
anyone who uses light magic.

128
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,710
Who the hell are you?

129
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,450
And what's so fun about all of this?

130
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,630
Let me tell you a fable.

131
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,720
Long ago, in a certain village, there lived
a people with very strong magic.

132
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,720
They were loved by mana.

133
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,890
They changed the weather
and manipulated ley lines.

134
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,890
They had power to rival the gods.

135
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,400
The humans from outside the
village worshipped them as such.

136
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,760
However, gradually, the humans
grew to fear their power.

137
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,160
They envied it and wanted it.

138
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,050
They tricked them, massacred them,
and stole their powers.

139
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,090
What kind of story was that?

140
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,170
What's that got to do with you?

141
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,610
Planning to become a bard or something?

142
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,680
All right, I've got a little story, too.

143
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,390
In a certain place,
there was a pure young man.

144
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,230
His folks were fishermen, and they started
sending him out to fish from a young age.

145
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,900
And then he got shipwrecked...

146
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,400
Augh!

147
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,120
Seriously?

148
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,450
...and washed ashore in a strange country.

149
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,330
Who the hell is this?

150
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,080
He's wearing grass sandals.

151
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,000
You can't be serious!

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,510
Since his race and culture were different,
he went through some nasty stuff there.

153
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,380
But...

154
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,520
He kicked all their asses and
became the boss of a group.

155
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,640
The end!

156
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,870
Well? What'd you think of my response fable?

157
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,490
Well, it's half of my life, actually.

158
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,030
You bastard! You dare mock Master Licht?!

159
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,560
Shut up! Your face is scary!

160
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,370
Why are there lines on your face?!

161
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,910
You're bringing that up now?!

162
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,170
He got faster.

163
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,550
As a foreigner, I suppose my
story had nothing to do with you.

164
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,840
Would you mind stepping off the stage, then?

165
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,930
Captain Yami!

166
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,430
I wonder how long you can
avoid a fatal blow?

167
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,190
Are you the guy who took out Fuegoleon?

168
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,900
I am.

169
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,730
Although I laid my plans carefully
and had him walk into a trap.

170
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,240
Yeah, I figured.

171
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,040
You'd never take down that King
of Hardnoses with stuff like this.

172
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,140
Dark Magic:

173
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,890
Dark Cloaked

174
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,640
Lightless Slash!

175
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,670
Master Licht!

176
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,150
A-Amazing... He's so frickin' cool!

177
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,200
Trap, eh? I'm sure you wouldn't
have been able to win

178
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,050
without doing something underhanded.

179
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,030
How dare you?!

180
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,550
This time, come right at me.

181
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,540
I'll show you the true power
of a Magic Knight Captain!

182
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,160
Hey, brat. Were you watching that?

183
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
Y-Yes, sir!

184
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,200
Good. Now try the same thing.

185
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,210
Yes, sir!

186
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
Wait... Like I could actually do that!

187
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,350
Of course I can't!

188
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,300
Oh? Who do you think you're talking to?

189
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,400
Huh?

190
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,320
I told you to do it, so do it.

191
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,240
Ow, ow, ow, that really hurts! Ow, ow, ow!

192
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,600
That'll make you a bigger man.

193
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,100
Not only did he manage to stop
all of Master Licht's attacks,

194
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,870
he even managed to counter.

195
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,430
The Black Bulls' captain...

196
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,250
Does his strength actually
rival the Wizard King's?!

197
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,260
I see... So this is dark magic.

198
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,010
Light Recovery Magic:
Healing Light Particles.

199
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,350
He can use recovery magic, too?

200
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,770
I haven't seen it in person much,

201
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,820
but apparently, guys loved by
mana can use all sorts of magic.

202
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,820
It's especially rare for an
attack-type to also be able to heal.

203
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,210
Anyway, get ready.

204
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,870
He was actually serious!

205
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,250
No, really! I can't!

206
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,990
Not in the middle of fighting!

207
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,130
Not to mention, I don't have any magic!

208
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,070
I don't mean the last attack I did.

209
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,940
I'm saying do the thing before that, idiot.

210
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,140
And I can't block attacks that I can't see!

211
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,890
You're hopeless.

212
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,840
I'll explain it just this once.
You'll have to pay me 500 yuls later.

213
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,770
He's charging?!

214
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,060
The reason I've been able
to react to the attacks

215
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,320
is because of something called "ki"
from back in my homeland.

216
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,520
Ki? Not mana?

217
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,320
Yeah.

218
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:26,840
Ki

219
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,430
People looking at you,
the sound of their breathing,

220
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,090
their smell, the motions of their muscles,

221
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,030
the vague sense that they're there...

222
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,770
Ki is the blanket term for all of the
different types of life energy

223
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,840
the human body emits.

224
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,760
I read that ki and predicted
his next move, then made mine.

225
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,390
You've done that before, haven't you?

226
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,930
Come to think of it...

227
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,850
When I do it, I combine it with
magic and muscle, and fight that way.

228
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,360
I guess it's like being a magic
swordsman or something.

229
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,900
Muscles! So that's why your neck's
so thick, Captain Yami!

230
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,120
Like you can talk, kid.

231
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,420
He has the nerve to converse during a battle.

232
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,910
The insolence...

233
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,560
He's just full of surprises.

234
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,460
To think he could keep up
with this speed, as well.

235
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,220
I cannot allow him to trouble
you any further, Master Licht.

236
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,170
I know this is impertinent of me,
but would you allow me to assist you?

237
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,560
Thank you, Valtos. You're always so helpful.

238
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,650
In that case, that boy...
Would you capture him?

239
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,400
You may injure him slightly if need be.

240
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,900
An easy task.

241
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,950
Huh?

242
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,190
That was close!

243
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,960
Perfect timing. Practice on that
scrawny dude with the slanty eyes.

244
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,370
Huh?! On the scrawny dude
with the slanty eyes?

245
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,300
That's too sudden! Of course I can't!

246
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,160
Where I come from, we've got this saying...

247
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,640
"A warrior never goes back on his word."

248
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,450
You said you were going to
become the Wizard King, didn't you?

249
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,790
Surpass your limits. Right here, right now.

250
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,820
There's no other way.

251
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Yes, sir!

252
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,730
I don't get it at all, but...

253
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,330
For starters, concentrate... Concentrate!

254
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,840
Someone with no magic like you
could never stop my attacks.

255
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,090
You're there!

256
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,760
I didn't stop all of it.

257
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,220
Wrong.

258
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,580
You can't fool me, kid.

259
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,040
You just reacted to your ears that time.

260
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,130
That ain't ki.

261
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,230
Use all five senses, and sense it
with your whole body, you moron!

262
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,060
With my whole body?

263
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,490
Yeah. You can't just rely
on your ears or your eyes.

264
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,390
Visualize something halfway between
instinct and a prediction.

265
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,360
If you don't do it right, I'll kill you!

266
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,750
That's insane.

267
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,330
But I think I kinda get it.

268
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,300
Not just my ears, not just my eyes...

269
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,600
Then... I'm just going to reset everything.

270
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,690
Concentrate...

271
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,850
You're there!

272
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,940
Wha—

273
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,580
I did it!

274
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,790
I did it, Captain Yami!

275
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,570
Wow, you actually managed to do it?
Talk about creepy, you weirdo.

276
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,710
What?!

277
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,680
Valtos...

278
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,330
How dare you... harm Valtos?!

279
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,940
I cannot allow people like
you to harm my comrades

280
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,320
ever again!

281
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,930
What's your deal? You're the
ones who started this!

282
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:32,150
The path this spell traces
resembles the motions of a whip.

283
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,280
Can you predict its movements?

284
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:44,260
It's said that whips were used to
punish criminals, once upon a time.

285
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,390
That makes it a perfect fit for you two!

286
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,270
Light Creation Magic: Light Whip of Judgment!

287
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,030
It's useless to struggle!

288
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,410
The cave!

289
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,930
That nutcase has gone ballistic!

290
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,970
Oh, dear... I held back most of my magic,

291
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,320
but it's all really too fragile...

292
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,790
Both this world and you fools.

293
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,000
You're amazing, Master Licht!
Your strength is practically divine!

294
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,460
If you felt like it, Master Licht, the Magic
Knights would be no more than infants!

295
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,840
What?!

296
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,480
The leader of the Eye of the
Midnight Sun... Licht, was it?

297
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,170
Talk about a huge forehead.

298
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,320
I guess you'd expect that
from a light magic user.

299
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,570
Black Clover, Page 35:

Page 35
The Light of Judgment

301
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,820
Going beyond my limits is my magic!
