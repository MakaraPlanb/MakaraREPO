1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,010
To retrieve the magic stone that
the Eye of the Midnight Sun is after,

5
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,100
Asta and the others headed
for the Underwater Temple.

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,850
But a strong flow of mana
caused powerful currents,

7
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,190
making it impossible for anyone to go in.

8
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,840
The only time the mana would weaken was
in a week, on the night of the full moon.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,690
Yami ordered Noelle to master a
water spell that would allow them

10
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,550
to move through the water by then.

11
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,820
Asta and a mysterious girl
named Kahono encouraged Noelle

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,240
when she was unable
to control her powers.

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,330
The rest of the Black Bulls also joined in.

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,330
And then...

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,430
They all acknowledged me
and gave me a mission.

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,590
I want to help them!

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,590
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!

18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,520
I... I did it!

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,720
All right!

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,200
The Sea Dragon's Cradle...

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,430
Kahono! I did it—

22
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,570
Huh? Kahono?

23
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,960
You've got some great friends!

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,670
They're the ones who should be
cheering for you in the end!

25
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,950
Good for you!

26
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,380
Well, I'll be waiting for you, Noelle!

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,830
Inside the temple! Okay?

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,660
The Underwater Temple

29
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,170
Tonight's finally the night of the full moon.

30
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,180
The mana deep within
these waters will weaken,

31
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,160
so it's the only day we'll be able
to reach the Underwater Temple.

32
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,350
You guys better be ready.

33
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,610
Just you wait, Underwater Temple!

34
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,320
Just you wait, magic stone!

35
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,280
Just you wait, unidentified seafood!

36
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,510
I wonder if they'll have something
rare that I haven't tried yet.

37
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,700
I wonder who I'll be able
to fight. I can't wait!

38
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,450
Let's hurry up and go!

39
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,330
The sooner we go, the sooner we can
go home, and the sooner I can see Marie.

40
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,380
And I can get back to flirting!

41
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,970
Looks like you're all set.

42
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,740
We're counting on you, Noelle.

43
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,110
R-Right...

44
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,120
Are you nervous?

45
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,870
H-Huh? I-I-I'm not nervous at all!

46
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,810
Everything went great yesterday.

47
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,870
Aw, you're so stiff.

48
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,300
Wanna drink this so you can relax?

49
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,200
Why would you offer her
a drink, you lush?!

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,030
Our lives are at stake here!

51
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,500
Well, if she's feeling pressured,

52
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,660
it might not work out,
no matter how good she is.

53
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,210
Noelle, just take it easy.

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,090
But if you mess it up, I'll kill you.

55
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,470
The pressure's so intense!

56
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,550
Honestly, what's with you people?

57
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,010
I feel stupid for even being
nervous in the first place.

58
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,300
I mean, none of these guys

59
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,020
believe for a second that my magic will fail.

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,650
Okay, here we go.

61
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,950
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!

62
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,080
I did it! It worked!

63
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,670
This is amazing, Noelle, but...

64
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,020
G-Grey...

65
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,920
Get off me, you big tub of lard!

66
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,430
I think I want to kill you.

67
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,550
Turn into someone smaller!

68
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,020
How's this, my inferiors?

69
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,810
Now your ego's inflated!

70
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,320
Well done, Noelle. I'm counting on you
to get us to the Underwater Temple.

71
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,740
O-Of course. Here we go.

72
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,120
H-He praised me!

73
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,340
This is awesome!

74
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,050
We're actually moving through the ocean!

75
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,100
So many yummy-looking fish!

76
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,200
Look, Marie! This is what it
looks like inside the ocean.

77
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,440
Hey, get closer to the fish!
Marie wants to see!

78
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
I don't have time for that!

79
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,290
Marie! Marie!

80
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,100
Let me see your precious face!

81
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,820
The mana in the water's getting stronger.

82
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,450
Come back! Marie!

83
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,920
What's that?

84
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,780
What the hell is that?!

85
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,450
Looks like the entrance
to the strong magic region.

86
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,620
I-Is the mana here really weaker?

87
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,040
The strong magic region's insane!

88
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,290
Lady Noe, you'd better be able to handle this!

89
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,750
You're probably super scared,
Magna, since you use fire.

90
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,180
Wh-Wh-Who are you calling scared, you jerk?!

91
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,320
You've got this, Noelle!

92
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,320
La!

93
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,930
You can do this, Noelle!

94
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,930
La!

95
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,160
Go, go, to the strong magic region!

96
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,160
La! La! La!

97
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,440
Hey, shut up! I can't concentrate!

98
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,980
We're just barely avoiding the currents...

99
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,820
It's as though the mana
is cooperating with us.

100
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,320
We can do this.

101
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,360
Crap. I feel sick.

102
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,160
I'm gonna throw up.

103
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,070
If you throw up in here,
I'll kill you, pervy woman!

104
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,080
The intensity is decreasing.

105
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,410
Whoa!

106
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,740
This is awesome!

107
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,590
It's so pretty!

108
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,330
There are so many creatures
I've never seen before!

109
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,870
That fish is super shiny!

110
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,490
Isn't that glow... magic? So badass.

111
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,540
Looks like some of the creatures evolved
a bit further because of the mana.

112
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,650
I wonder if it's yummy.

113
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,530
I wonder if its taste
evolved a bit further, too.

114
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,280
We're gonna go catch it real quick!

115
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,420
You idiots!

116
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,420
Do you two want to drown?!

117
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,510
And Grey, you don't need to
mimic her glutton side, too!

118
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,230
That's...

119
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,160
Those whirlpools... They're magic barriers!

120
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,230
And they're extremely powerful.

121
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,230
We won't be able to get through like this.

122
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,370
All right, you're up, kid.

123
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,740
Go slice through it with
your anti-magic sword.

124
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,840
Captain Yami...

125
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,980
Huh?

126
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,350
You see... coming to the ocean for my first
time made me realize something crazy.

127
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,750
I can't swim!

128
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,250
Man, doesn't that suck?

129
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,560
Who said you need to swim?

130
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,760
Huh?

131
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,010
P-P-Please wait! At least give
me time to get myself ready!

132
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:02,090
Your time is my time...
and my time is my time.

133
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,270
What?!

134
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,270
Ready, and go!

135
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,310
I can't breathe! I'm gonna drown!

136
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,040
Huh? There's air.

137
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,580
Good work.

138
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,000
Woohoo! We're saved!

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,490
See? You were scared.
You even peed your pants.

140
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,260
I did not, you bastard!
They're just wet from the water!

141
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,020
The mana's too strong!
I can't connect with Marie!

142
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,510
Gauche! Gauche!

143
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,550
You're on top of me!

144
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,890
Marie's more important!

145
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,560
But what a surprise.

146
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,890
Who knew there was a space
like this on the ocean floor?

147
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,990
Oh?

148
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,100
Oh, my.

149
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,790
So this is the Underwater Temple!

150
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,790
Charmy.

151
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,540
Make us some cotton.

152
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,790
Roger!

153
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,680
Munchy, munchy, munchy...

154
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,310
Have a bite.

155
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,180
Thanks!

156
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,190
How boring. No one's attacking us.

157
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,640
True. There don't even seem
to be any trap spells.

158
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,870
That's a bit disappointing.

159
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,730
Aw, how boring.

160
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,870
Don't you dare let your
guard down, you bastards!

161
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,450
This is the strong magic region!
Be ready for anything!

162
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,810
Yeah!

163
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,140
There.

164
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,220
This is awesome!

165
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,060
Are these houses?

166
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,490
Does that mean there are underwater people?

167
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,600
Are they strong? Are they violent?

168
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,290
Aren't you guys excited to fight them?!

169
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,980
That'd be just you, kid.

170
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,120
Hey! There are people over there!

171
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,890
Seriously? Underwater people?

172
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,410
They won't suddenly attack, will they?!

173
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,950
Shh! They'll hear us.

174
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,020
Hey, are they...

175
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,580
Yeah, I think they definitely heard us.

176
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,520
How rare!

177
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,720
Guys! We have visitors for once!

178
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,740
Wait, that robe... Are you a Magic Knight?

179
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,430
So cool!

180
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,290
Tell us about the outside world.

181
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,030
What kinds of missions have you done?

182
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,030
Okay, okay!

183
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,810
Leave everything to the great Charmy!

184
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,810
It's been about ten years
since we had visitors.

185
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,710
Wait! I was picturing a dangerous dungeon!

186
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,310
Thankfully, most of the time,
what you expect isn't what you get.

187
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,700
I guess we should find
someone who looks like

188
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,030
they know something about the magic stone.

189
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,820
Indeed.

190
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,140
Well, hurry up and bring out the
boss of this temple. Capisce?

191
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,200
Captain Yami! You sound
like some gangster!

192
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,520
Got it! That'd probably be
the high priest! Capisce?

193
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,280
You can find the high priest
right up those stairs. Capisce?

194
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,400
I can take you there. Capisce?

195
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,420
It caught on!

196
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,470
Hey, you guys are cute. Why don't we
have an underwater barbecue together?

197
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,720
Right, Gauche?

198
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,220
Marie is a billion times cuter.

199
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,940
H-Hey, Grey!

200
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,740
Why don't you turn into me?
We can have that witty twin banter again.

201
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,230
No one's as pretty as you
in the outside world.

202
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,860
You turned into Gordon and you're
flirting?! Seriously? Why Gordon?!

203
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,530
Crab pot, crab egg foo young,
crab dumplings...

204
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,940
Things seem to be going really smoothly.

205
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,280
Isn't that a good thing?

206
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,000
Though you're probably not satisfied
if you're not almost dying all the time.

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,170
Uh, it's not like I actually
enjoy almost dying all the time!

208
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,840
This must be it.

209
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,200
Tell the high priest hi for us!

210
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,690
Let's chat some more when you come back.

211
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,360
Sure, thanks!

212
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,730
If you do...

213
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,100
...actually return, that is.

214
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,040
There's someone there.

215
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,710
Is that the high priest guy?!

216
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,750
Hey!

217
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,470
There's something really crazy here!

218
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,910
Hurry up and do something, Asta!

219
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,180
Wait! It might actually be the
kind-hearted protector of the temple,

220
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,980
despite how it looks!

221
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,530
I won't do anything unless it attacks—

222
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,160
What?!

223
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,240
What's that big creepy thing?

224
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,580
They didn't even hesitate!

225
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,060
Well, well! Looks like we've
got some interesting guests!

226
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,490
Welcome to the Underwater Temple!

227
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm the high priest here!

228
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,650
What's with the hyper geezer?

229
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,690
Hey. That was some welcome, you old fart.

230
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,330
I just love surprising people!

231
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,320
Those young 'uns over there had
some delightful reactions.

232
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,650
You need a better hobby.

233
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,010
I wonder if he's yummy.

234
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,530
Uh, Charmy, I wouldn't...

235
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,970
It just fell apart?!

236
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,700
It made itself easier to eat?!

237
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,370
That's my magic.

238
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,850
Huh?!

239
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,000
I couldn't eat it.

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,570
I don't know what kind
of magic that was, but...

241
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,210
He made something that big with magic?

242
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,680
Who is this old guy?

243
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,640
You guys are after the
magic stone, aren't you?

244
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,060
If you want it, why don't
we play a little game?

245
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,190
Play a game with you?

246
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,020
And there it is. It's probably
something really dangerous.

247
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,570
He's calling it a game, but it's probably
something that could potentially kill us!

248
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,080
I call this game...

249
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,910
The boob-squeezing game!

250
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,060
Nobody's going to be playing that.

251
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,650
Hey! Don't beat on the high priest!

252
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,040
I think he's really important!

253
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,800
And I'm royalty!

254
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,840
Oh, I'm just kidding!

255
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,970
I think you need to know there are people
in this world that you shouldn't joke with.

256
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,100
Stop! Let's all respect our elders!

257
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,710
Hey, old man. We don't have
time to play with you.

258
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,320
How do you know about
the magic stone, anyway?

259
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,680
I have pretty good eyes, you see.

260
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,820
What'll it be? You want the magic stone
for your kingdom, don't you?

261
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,270
What do you wanna do?
Send him flying and steal it?

262
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,780
Yeah, that sounds fast. I'm in.

263
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,240
That old guy seems like he has lots of magic,
so it might be fun to fight him!

264
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,730
Hey! I'm hearing a lot of
dangerous talk over there!

265
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,940
Magic Knights aren't allowed to do that!

266
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,680
There's no way that old man is normal.

267
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,650
I need to make sure I don't get
pulled into anything troublesome.

268
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,310
I'm getting sleepy.

269
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,520
Pardon me, but where's the food?

270
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,760
And you people don't intend to work at all!

271
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,110
Haven't you made up your minds yet?

272
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,550
If you win the game,
in addition to the magic stone,

273
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,330
I'll gather the temple's
most beautiful girls

274
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:58,870
and hold an exquisite banquet
with the very best food and drink.

275
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,700
Let's do this!

276
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,250
Seriously?

277
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,670
Is that more important than the mission?!

278
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,710
I'll do anything from games to working out!

279
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,670
Okay, dial it back a bit.

280
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,630
All right, old man. We'll do it.

281
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,270
This gaming expert will take you on.

282
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,330
You go, Mister Yami! You're the
biggest player of them all!

283
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,730
So what are we playing?

284
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,480
Dice? Roulette?

285
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,980
A white-hot...

286
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Temple battle royale!

287
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,240
Yeah!

288
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,500
Temple mages, come on out!

289
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,500
Game Magic: Temple Shuffle!

290
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,510
What're those?

291
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,260
New passages?

292
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,060
You called, High Priest?

293
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,390
Finally! Mages from the outside who
made it to the Underwater Temple!

294
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,610
I'm so excited!

295
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,260
Still... They don't look that tough.

296
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,890
The fish are talking!

297
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,780
Huh? What was that, punk?
Look at your lame-ass masks!

298
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,260
The magic's just rolling off these guys!

299
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,250
Are they the warriors from
the Underwater Temple?

300
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,540
Well, then. Why don't we get started?

301
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,690
Wait, already?

302
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,250
And start what?

303
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,550
All right, then.

304
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,550
Let the games... begin!

305
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,390
I'm not ready yet!

306
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,470
What the heck, man?

307
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,130
Where am I? Where is everyone?

308
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,040
Test, test, test. Can you all hear me?

309
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:14,000
You've been scattered to different
areas inside the temple.

310
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,860
So we're still inside the temple. Awesome!

311
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,880
Starting now,

312
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,390
you'll face off against the
temple mages, nine-on-nine.

313
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,850
Where's the food?

314
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,330
Come to think of it, I don't
know any attack spells yet!

315
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,250
Wait. Nine?

316
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,650
There should be ten of us...
We're missing one.

317
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,480
The rules are simple.

318
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,550
If you knock out your opponent, you win.

319
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,820
If your opponent gives up, you win.

320
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,890
I think I sobered up a little.

321
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,620
Victory goes to the first team
to wipe out the other team,

322
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,490
or whichever team has the
most members left in the end.

323
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,780
I wonder who I should turn into next.

324
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,780
You can fight however you'd like!

325
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,570
You can fight one-on-one or even run away.

326
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,380
You can find your friends
and fight together, as well!

327
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,260
This sounds way too violent.

328
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,580
Fine! I'm gonna run like
a bunny. Go for it, guys!

329
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,480
However, my nuisance spells
are out there, so be careful!

330
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,380
Nuisance spells?

331
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,230
Just you wait, stupid geezer.

332
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,510
Yay! This is awesome!

333
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,070
A blood-soaked battle! I'm super pumped!

334
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,010
That's so easy to understand!

335
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,570
All right! Bring it on!

336
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,530
Oh?

337
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,940
That's funny...

338
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,420
I can't seem to sense any magic from you.

339
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,050
Can you actually fight?

340
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,840
Good grief. Guess I picked a loser.

341
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,170
Wanna find out if I'm
actually a loser or not?

342
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,280
Petit Clover

343
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,430
Petit Clover!

344
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,780
There Are Ten of Us

345
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,790
There Are Ten of Us.

346
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,370
You called, High Priest?

347
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,370
Sorry to call the nine of
you here without warning.

348
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,490
Sadly, I have some bad news.

349
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,690
Huh?

350
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:47,800
Something felt off, so I counted again,
and there's one extra.

351
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,800
One extra?

352
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,390
What do you mean?

353
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,700
Your numbers.

354
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,080
What?!

355
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,290
That's impossible!
