1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,700
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,770
Asta and the others finally
arrived at the Underwater Temple.

5
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,060
But once they got there...

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,800
You guys are after the
magic stone, aren't you?

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,250
If you want it, why don't
we play a little game?

8
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,650
...a mysterious old man called the high priest

9
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,480
and nine temple mages were waiting for them!

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,900
The high priest told Asta and the other
Black Bulls, who were separated,

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,530
that if they wanted the magic stone, they
must battle the temple mages, nine-on-nine.

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,850
Victory goes to the first team
to wipe out the other team,

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,530
or whichever team has the
most members left in the end.

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,390
Yay! This is awesome!

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,710
A blood-soaked battle! I'm super pumped!

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,480
Nine?

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,010
There should be ten of us...
We're missing one.

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,100
That's so easy to understand!

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,430
All right! Bring it on!

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,490
That's funny...

21
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,680
I can't seem to sense any magic from you.

22
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,980
Guess I picked a loser.

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,130
Wanna find out if I'm
actually a loser or not?

24
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,640
Temple Battle Royale

25
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,490
Now, then, why don't we watch from here?

26
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,880
I've got plenty of food and drink!

27
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,350
Hey, you old geezer,
don't leave me out of the game!

28
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,640
I got all pumped up, but now I'm sad.

29
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,640
You're a bit too strong.

30
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,230
All the people outside, as well as myself,
are very excited for this game.

31
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,480
It'd be no fun if it were to end quickly.

32
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,560
Looks like you really do get it, gramps.

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,540
You've got good taste.

34
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,310
I do, don't I?

35
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,420
Ooh, it looks like a few
match-ups have already begun.

36
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,960
All right. If any of mine lose, I'll kill 'em.

37
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,240
So cold... Damn that geezer.

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,380
He's gonna pay for this!

39
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,100
Hilarious!

40
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,840
You're at a total disadvantage with
fire magic in a place like this.

41
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,550
Looks like I win.

42
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,060
I'd rather not pick on
frail-looking guys like you.

43
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,190
Are you gonna fight me?

44
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,850
I know you guys.

45
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,120
You're the Black Bulls, aren't you?

46
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,530
You're the weakest of the Magic Knights.

47
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,030
Marie's waiting for me.
Hurry up and come at me, damn it.

48
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,080
Just so you know, it's pretty pointless
for you to wave around that rusty sword.

49
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,090
My mollusk magic can
parry any kind of attack.

50
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,840
I see...

51
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,200
Isn't this exciting?

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,310
Oh, by the way, what are your knights' ranks?

53
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,780
They're all junior magic knights.

54
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,560
I'm surprised you even know
about that, living down here.

55
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,610
According to your ranking system,

56
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,010
my temple mages would be more
powerful than intermediate knights!

57
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,490
Those juniors don't stand a chance!

58
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,000
What? Really?

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,660
Well, that's not good...

60
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,900
Unless those idiots are actually
stronger than usual for their titles.

61
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,000
Wh-Wh-Wh-What?!

62
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,520
Don't think I'm gonna get discouraged
just because I'm surrounded by water.

63
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,970
I'm gonna serve all of you up like grilled fish!

64
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,510
He must've been one of the weaker ones.

65
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,220
So... I wonder where
all the strong ones are?

66
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,500
Good grief.

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,190
I need to finish this nonsense quick
so I can go back to doting on Marie.

68
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,930
This... isn't right...

69
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,150
My mollusk magic should be able to
deflect any kind of physical attack.

70
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,980
My sword is anti-magic! That junk won't work!

71
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,620
What?

72
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,430
Next, next!

73
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,820
Good job, you idiots!
Beat the crap out of them!

74
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,130
Those fools let down their guard!

75
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,070
Hey, gramps, I forgot! We should
bet on which team is gonna win!

76
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,100
I bet 10,000 yuls on the Bulls!

77
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,010
Grr... The battle's just begun!

78
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,930
They won't be able to defeat the
remaining priests so easily!

79
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,520
Especially the Three Great Priests,
who are on par with senior knights.

80
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,490
Badump, badump...

81
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,990
Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak...

82
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,670
Whew... Man, that was close.

83
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,450
There's no way I could fight
a guy who looks that strong.

84
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:39,190
I've been trying to get to the places I
marked outside, but I can't for some reason.

85
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,460
That means I can only use my spatial
magic to get to places I can see.

86
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,370
Oh, I forgot to mention this,

87
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,530
but you won't be able to leave my
playground until the game's over.

88
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,670
Whoa! Are you watching me, gramps?!

89
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,290
Hey, Finral, why the hell are you hiding?
Hurry up and fight, or I'll kill you!

90
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,520
Huh? Yami?!

91
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,590
Wait, are you with the old guy?

92
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,740
We're enjoying some food and drinks
while we watch you guys fight.

93
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,400
What?! Come on, make him
stop this violent game!

94
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,150
What? It's fun to watch
because it's so violent.

95
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,920
That's right!

96
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,490
When did you two hit it off so well?!

97
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,690
It's definitely no fun if
you're not gonna fight.

98
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,170
Don't let that coward get away.

99
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,370
There we go! Nuisance spell activated.

100
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,210
Game Magic: Monster Toy.

101
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,630
Scary!

102
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,640
How entertaining! I should use more of these!

103
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,890
Hey, you old geezer...

104
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,360
Let's do this one next.
This'll probably kill them!

105
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,750
Are you sure you're actually on their side?

106
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,230
Nice drawing, though.

107
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,780
Now, then... Let's see how
the others are holding up.

108
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,560
That bastard Grey turned into a crab,
and I don't know where he went,

109
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,040
so I'll just have to kill him later.

110
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,860
Oh? Is Charmy battling?

111
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,490
S-Such destructive force...

112
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,800
Th-The Underwater Temple is amazing.

113
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,010
And so is its seafood!

114
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,350
S-So good! Munchy, munchy...

115
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,160
This is the best I've ever had!

116
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,810
So this is the Underwater Temple's seafood!

117
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,810
I wish my meal-saving prince
could have some, too!

118
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,070
Okay! This entire ecosystem is mine!

119
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm going to eat absolutely everything!

120
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,500
That one there... What exactly is she doing?

121
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! What a huge haul!

122
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,880
Found you!

123
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,420
La?

124
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,970
My, what a cute little target. I almost
feel bad that I'm going to defeat you.

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,250
So you're finally here.

126
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,750
But right now, I'm overflowing
with undersea mana.

127
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,670
If you want me to chew you up
the way I chewed up those fish,

128
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,990
bring it on!

129
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,280
Song Magic: Mother Lullaby.

130
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,710
I feel so nice...

131
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,650
Why, yes, I can still eat more...

132
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,130
One down!

133
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,410
Just so you know, sleeping counts as a K.O.

134
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,780
How do you like the power
of one of my Great Priests?

135
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,440
She's not getting any food for a week.

136
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,380
Now, then...

137
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,980
I wonder if I'll see those two next.

138
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,630
All right! My clothes are finally dry!

139
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,030
Let's see... Who am I gonna fight next?

140
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,700
Hey, Luck. I guess you're still alive.

141
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,370
Yup! I defeated one of
the enemy guys already.

142
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,750
I headed this way because I felt a
strong presence over here, but...

143
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,250
Looks like I was right...

144
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,590
All right... let's decide who
gets a piece of 'em firâ€”

145
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,090
Hey! No fair, Luck! You bastard!

146
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,430
Ya snooze, ya lose, Magna!

147
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,400
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

148
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,610
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Shield.

149
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,830
It's tough! My lighting should work
pretty well against water, though.

150
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,550
Well, well, aren't you lively?

151
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,630
What the heck are these things?!

152
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,100
This ki... Someone's there.

153
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,960
Come on, Grandpa. Do you really have
to hit us with your nuisance spells, too?

154
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,650
Well, whatever. That was a good warm-up.

155
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,690
Hup!

156
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,860
He took out something that huge?
Who the heck is he?

157
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,560
Hey, there!

158
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,450
You're Asta, right?

159
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,900
Huh? Yeah, that's right...

160
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,470
I've heard about you! You use a strange
sword that cancels out magic, right?

161
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,630
Uh, yes... Wait, who'd you hear that from?!

162
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,630
Never mind that! Check out this dance!

163
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,280
The hell?! He just started dancing!

164
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,280
But it's a really cool dance!

165
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,610
Do you think they'd like this
dance up on the surface, too?

166
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,990
Heck yeah!

167
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,410
The name's Kiato!

168
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,360
My dream's to become a dancer who
captivates the whole kingdom!

169
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,410
He just started talking about his dream?!

170
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,040
Although people from the Underwater Temple
can go to the kingdom's beaches,

171
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,740
we can't go to the capital.
It's against the rules.

172
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,430
But if we win this fight, Grandpa said...

173
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,120
Oh, the high priest is my grandpa.

174
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,360
Anyway, he said we could use the high
priest's authority to go up to the surface!

175
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,520
I'm gonna make a name for myself
and become a super famous dancer!

176
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,810
He just told me all about this huge dream!

177
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,330
Hey, wait a sec...

178
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,940
This all seems pretty familiar.

179
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,560
So listen...

180
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,540
I'm gonna take you down
for the sake of my dream!

181
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,820
He's fast!

182
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,290
I have my own dream, too!

183
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,380
Huh?

184
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,070
I wanna become the strongest man
who protects the Clover Kingdom,

185
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,970
the Wizard King!

186
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,530
So for that dream...

187
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,970
I'm gonna take you down!

188
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,770
I like it!

189
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,310
Then let's bet our dreams on
a head-to-head showdown!

190
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,730
Bring it on!

191
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,830
Wh-What am I going to do? I haven't
learned a single attack spell yet.

192
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,650
Hey, there! I finally found you!

193
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,750
Sh-Shoot! I'm in trouble!

194
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,330
Y-You want to take on
a royal such as myself?

195
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,540
You've got some guts! This is your
chance to run away if you want!

196
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,920
First off, I'm glad you
could make it, Noelle!

197
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,340
H-How do you know my name?

198
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,890
Oh, right. I guess you can't
tell with this thing on my face.

199
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,350
Huh?

200
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,090
Kahono!

201
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,210
I've been waiting for you, Noelle!

202
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,790
Kahono... I had no idea you were
from the Underwater Temple.

203
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,000
Why did you help me learn magic?

204
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,050
I was actually looking for people who
wanted to come to the Underwater Temple

205
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,050
while I practiced singing on that beach.

206
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,640
You see, when we have guests, Grandpa...
I mean, the high priest, always holds games.

207
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,160
If I win, I'll be able to go to the surface

208
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,890
and make my dream to
become an idol come true!

209
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,600
Your dream? Then you used me?!

210
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,940
Huh? No.

211
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,870
It's true that I wanted to help you,
since you were working so hard,

212
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,100
and it's also true that I wanted
to become friends with you.

213
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,240
But from now on, we'll fight fair and
square as opponents in this game!

214
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,830
No! We're supposed to be friends!

215
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,950
Yup!

216
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,800
Friends are people who can clash over
things that are precious to them,

217
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,340
but keep smiling together even then!

218
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,840
Song Magic: Mother Lullaby.

219
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,210
What is this spell?

220
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,010
I-It's going to make me...

221
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,770
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!

222
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,310
Now you're ready to fight?

223
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,030
Song Magic: Destructive Beat!

224
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,640
Come on, now, Noelle!

225
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,660
You'll never win if you just keep defending!

226
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,660
What do you think you're doing?!

227
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,660
She only let off some magic
energy, but look at that force!

228
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,820
Amazing!

229
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,380
Huh? What're you doing, Noelle?

230
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,020
An attack like that won't
have any effect on me.

231
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,760
Aim straight! That sucked!

232
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,010
Shut up!

233
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,570
I still can't control my magic
when I'm attacking, you idiot!

234
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,350
That's not it. You're already
controlling your magic, Noelle.

235
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,310
Huh?

236
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,860
You're subconsciously trying
not to attack people.

237
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,940
You must not want to hurt anyone.

238
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,070
But are you sure you're okay with that?

239
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,580
Why did you come here, Noelle?

240
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,830
Didn't you come here to
make something come true?

241
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,170
If you don't fight for it and win it,

242
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,840
you'll never get what you want!

243
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,590
I... want to be useful to everyone!

244
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,350
Fine!

245
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,530
This guy's really strong!

246
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,320
And what's with his moves?

247
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,120
It's like his mind's gone somewhere else.
It's really hard to read his ki!

248
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,090
I think he's even throwing off my senses.

249
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,460
Is this his magic?

250
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,170
It's just like I thought.

251
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,930
If you're going up against a real sword,

252
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,970
your anti-magic sword is nothing
more than a lump of iron!

253
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,970
And if I add in my dance magic,
you won't be able to follow my moves!

254
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,480
How do you like my grandson? Isn't he strong?

255
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,300
Yeah, the kid definitely
knows how to handle a sword.

256
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,230
But...

257
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,820
Come on, now! Just surrender already, Asta!

258
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,200
This isn't good! I'm about to lose!

259
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,580
He really is like water.
There's no way to catch him...

260
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,880
Wait, maybe brute strength
isn't the way to go here!

261
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,820
I probably shouldn't try to capture water,
since it has no distinct shape!

262
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,450
Anyway, I need to calm down.

263
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,340
That's it!

264
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,910
I will also become like water!

265
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,860
Monkeying around won't get you anywhere!

266
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,250
Don't sell a monkey short!

267
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,770
I can't use magic!

268
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,060
And that's why...

269
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,560
I'll recreate magic with my body!

270
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,690
Pretty sure there are limits
when you can't use magic!

271
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,010
What?

272
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,570
In that case...

273
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,540
I'll use this chance...

274
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,120
to go beyond my limits!

275
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,660
Jeez... Just how athletic is this kid?

276
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,750
My idiot's ability to pick
things up quick is even greater!

277
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,340
What a rude man... Trying to set up a sneaky
trap for a defenseless woman like me.

278
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,640
You can't really complain if you
fall for a trap yourself, can you?

279
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:56,040
Seriously? Vanessa's usually drunk and
useless before she gets warmed up.

280
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,070
We're in top shape today.
I should've bet more, damn it.

281
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,480
These guys aren't junior mages at all!

282
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,640
But man, that lady's got some nice boobies.

283
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,410
Hey, old man. Could you get
that magic stone ready?

284
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,970
A really dangerous lot called the
Eye of the Midnight Sun is after that stone.

285
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,670
It'd be in your best interests
to just hand it over to us.

286
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,780
The best part of a game
is turning the tables.

287
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,770
You can't get lamer than bluffing, old man.

288
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,740
I'm not bluffing!

289
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,550
If my son and grandkids get serious,
we'll turn things around in an instant!

290
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,320
My son is the strongest mage
of the Underwater Temple!

291
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,150
Uh-oh... I think you're getting tired, Magna.

292
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,570
You can take a little break.

293
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,500
I couldn't feel better, you idiot.

294
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,490
You butt out, Luck.

295
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,580
Sorry to drag you into
my dad's game like this.

296
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,170
Dad? You're that geezer's son?

297
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,510
He's strong... His magic
is as deep as the sea.

298
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,820
No doubt about it... He's definitely
the strongest one here.

299
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,690
You two should come at me at once.

300
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,020
I'd rather not hurt you
any more than I need to.

301
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,770
At the very least, I'll end
all this in an instant.

302
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,230
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!

303
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,420
You ain't ending anyone, you bastard!

304
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,140
I'm not done having fun yet!

305
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,520
Huh?

306
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,870
Wh-What was that?

307
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,920
Wh-Wh-What the heck's going on?!

308
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,350
Looks like you're having fun.

309
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,390
Why don't you let us join in?

310
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,410
Petit Clover

311
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,560
Petit Clover!

312
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,870
Why Don't You Let Us Join In?

313
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,870
Why Don't You Let Us Join In?

314
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,540
Looks like you're having fun.

315
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,800
Why don't you let us join in?

316
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,420
Munchy, munchy...

317
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,550
La?

318
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,350
I-I must've come to the wrong place.

319
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,100
Munchy, munchy... Have a bite.

320
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,230
Have a bite, 'kay?

321
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,110
Well, if you insist, I guess I'll... join in.

322
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,920
I'll let you join in...

323
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,410
After you stir that pot.

324
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,910
Those who will not work do not get to munchy!

325
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,890
Stir, stir, stir...

326
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,890
Put your back into it!
It's not all about strength!

327
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,650
I see... This is quite deep.

328
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:31,060
And so, Vetto realized his dream to become
a chef and gave up on the magic stone.

329
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,980
Then everyone lived happily ever after!

330
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,020
That probably won't happen, huh?

331
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,860
Of course not!

332
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,390
To make the Eye of the Midnight Sun's
dream come true,

333
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,540
I, Vetto of the Third Eye,
shall obtain the magic stone!

334
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,940
Black Clover, Page 44: "The Pointlessly
Direct Fireball and the Wild Lightning."

335
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:54,250
Page 44
The Pointlessly Direct Fireball and the Wild Lightning

336
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,820
My beast magic shall destroy everything!
