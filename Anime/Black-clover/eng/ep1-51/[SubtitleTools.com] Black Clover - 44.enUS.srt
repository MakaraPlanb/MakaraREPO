1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,150
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,550
In search of the magic stone, Asta and the
others arrived at the Underwater Temple,

5
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,890
where they were forced to participate in High
Priest Gifso's game, the Temple Battle Royale.

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,690
According to your ranking system,

7
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,900
my temple mages would be more
powerful than intermediate knights!

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,070
Wh-Wh-Wh-What?!

9
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,290
Don't think I'm gonna get discouraged
just because I'm surrounded by water.

10
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,470
Magna and Luck also participated in the game,
hoping to get the magic stone.

11
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,210
Ya snooze, ya lose, Magna!

12
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,510
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

13
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,180
Well, well, aren't you lively?

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,680
My son is the strongest mage
of the Underwater Temple!

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,290
He's strong...

16
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,560
No doubt about it... He's definitely
the strongest one here.

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,530
You two should come at me at once.

18
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,780
I'd rather not hurt you
any more than I need to.

19
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,870
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,190
You ain't ending anyone, you bastard!

21
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,850
I'm not done having fun yet!

22
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,310
The one who appeared
before Magna and Luck

23
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,170
was one of the Eye of the
Midnight Sun's top brass, Vetto.

24
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,930
Looks like you're having fun.

25
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,430
Why don't you let us join in?

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,670
The Pointlessly Direct Fireball
and the Wild Lightning

27
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,570
Oh, it's a full moon tonight.

28
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,360
I wonder if Asta is looking up
at the same moon right now.

29
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,460
Oh, silly me!

30
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,340
Bah-ha? I guess I fell asleepâ€”

31
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,680
Bah-ha?!

32
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,240
Hmph. Not even good for a warm-up.

33
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,450
You're just a pack of mice.

34
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,740
Let's go.

35
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,540
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,410
Bah-ha...

37
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,320
I know we were all on vacation, but there
were a number of senior Magic Knights here!

38
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,570
And they were all defeated by one guy...

39
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,830
What were the Magic Knights we
believed in so much all about, then?

40
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,150
That thing wasn't human.

41
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,960
That was...

42
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,360
a beast!

43
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,320
Where'd this macho dude suddenly come from?

44
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,720
He looks pretty hardcore.

45
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,440
Aw, that shark guy was my prey.

46
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,570
All I know is... This guy's magic
power is greater than Captain Yami's.

47
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,100
You made it through
the rough ocean currents

48
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,770
and then forced your way in here...

49
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,110
That's some incredible magic, all right.

50
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,990
Oh? I guess you can still move.

51
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,670
Ow...

52
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm pretty sure you're not a Magic Knight.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,840
What brings you to the Underwater Temple?

54
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,210
We're after the same thing as those
two over there, the magic stone.

55
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,960
I see. But it's not like I'm
just going to hand it over.

56
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,010
Oh, I don't expect you to just hand it over.

57
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,470
We're going to lay waste to everyone here,
make you despair, and seize it!

58
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,720
What are you...

59
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,440
Scatter and spread despair!

60
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,550
Yes, sir!

61
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,180
Well, you're all rather rude, abrupt guests.

62
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,240
Could you head on home now?

63
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,740
Hey, you.

64
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,160
That's also a pretty rude
way to address someone.

65
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,030
If you want to get your way,

66
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,790
do something about it,
and hit me with all your magic.

67
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,810
Looks like you're completely
underestimating me.

68
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,420
I may not look like it, but I am the
strongest in the Underwater Temple.

69
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,930
Enough talk! Say it with your magic!

70
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,050
Well, if you insist...

71
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,270
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!

72
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,210
Beast Magic: Rhinoceros Armor.

73
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,610
It didn't even faze him.

74
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,340
That's not a bad spell, for a mouse.

75
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,620
Let me give you a reward.

76
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,960
A reward?

77
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,130
Yes, a reward called despair.

78
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,540
This world is all about the
survival of the fittest.

79
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,720
The strongest beasts survive, and the
weak vermin live only to become prey!

80
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,470
Beast Magic: Bear Claw!

81
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,860
Did you get a good feel for how
vastly different our powers are?

82
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,130
You insects aren't even
allowed to hold on to hope.

83
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,130
I-Impossible...

84
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,080
The temple's greatest warrior, Gio,
is being defeated so easily.

85
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,470
I've never seen anything like this.

86
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,100
Hey, gramps. Playtime's over.
Hurry up and get me in there.

87
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:29,110
Well, if you insist...
But who in the world is this man?

88
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,610
He's one of the leaders of a nasty terror
group called the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

89
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,660
The Eye of the Midnight Sun?

90
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,060
I don't have time to explain.
We're short on time, so hurry it up.

91
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,130
Sadly, I can't.

92
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,790
We can't leave here until the game is over.

93
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,800
I can't even undo the spell.
Those are the rules of my magic.

94
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,510
I see.

95
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,470
What are you...

96
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,730
Then I'll just let myself out.

97
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,640
Say what?

98
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,040
Dark Magic: Lightless Slash!

99
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,900
Wh-What in the world?!

100
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,060
Tch.

101
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,400
This is...

102
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,910
Spatial Magic: Different Dimension Sphere.

103
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,420
Once you're trapped in my spatial magic,

104
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,660
no matter who you are,
you won't be able to escape.

105
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,420
Black, foreign swordsman...

106
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,000
The mana tells me you're here.

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,050
Stay there and watch for a while.

108
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,590
You're going to be my main dish...

109
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,600
After I season you with despair,
as you watch all of your friends die!

110
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,640
If he gets out, the temple's done for.

111
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,600
Hey, gramps.

112
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,380
Wh-What?

113
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,080
Can you make it so they hear us out there?

114
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,950
Huh? S-Sure...

115
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,860
But what are you going to do?

116
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,870
Testing, testing...

117
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,660
That's the captain...

118
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,580
Hey, you dumbasses, listen up.

119
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,450
Captain! I beat one!

120
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,830
Someone really dangerous
just crashed the game.

121
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,370
He's one of the leaders of
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

122
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,370
and a beast of a man strong enough to go
head-to-head with a Magic Knight Captain.

123
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,390
It's him...

124
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,760
Also, three of his underlings
are over there, too.

125
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,510
Hurry up and hand over
that yummy-looking food...

126
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,700
Here's the problem... Due to reasons,
I can't go over there.

127
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,190
What?! What do you mean, "reasons"?!

128
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,440
Meaning you guys gotta
do something about him.

129
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,930
You can't be serious!

130
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,990
Listen up.

131
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,650
All of you, surpass your limits,
right here, right now.

132
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,430
If you die, I'll kill you.

133
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,340
That's all.

134
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,000
Live...

135
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,500
He's insane.

136
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,680
I never thought the game
could get so exciting.

137
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,510
It's a game that'll determine the fate
of the Underwater Temple, blast it!

138
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,100
The game rules have changed!

139
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,270
No time limit.

140
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,770
To clear the game, defeat the
Eye of the Midnight Sun's team.

141
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,120
Those who contribute to clearing the game

142
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,930
will get any wish that's
within my power to grant!

143
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,280
There's an absolute monster here...

144
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,750
Damn it.

145
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,210
I'm scared, but...

146
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,670
That makes him worth fighting even more!

147
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,170
I'll do this... I'm gonna do this, damn it!

148
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,180
Asta...

149
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,970
I guess we'll have to put
our match on hold.

150
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,330
Kiato...

151
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,640
All right, let's go!

152
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,520
Yeah!

153
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,240
Now, then... Who's my next prey?

154
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,300
Not yet...

155
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,700
Who said you could move on to the next?

156
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,080
We're still alive, you know.

157
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:18,210
After what Mister Yami said,
I can't just lie here napping.

158
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,210
Besides...

159
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,050
I'm not...

160
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,770
...going to break!

161
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,450
Excellent.

162
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:34,120
The more stubborn the prey, the better
it is when they're finally in despair!

163
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,050
Well, we managed to get back up,

164
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,880
but how the hell are we supposed
to fight that monster?

165
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,240
If he lands even one more decent
blow on us, we're finished... So...

166
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,420
Hey, you.

167
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,880
Hit us with another one of those.

168
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
What?!

169
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,720
That really fast one.

170
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,570
Damn it, Luck! What the hell?! Are you stupid?!

171
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,140
We just barely managed to block that attack,
and we both still took a ton of damage!

172
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,390
Oh? So you're imitating me. Very well.

173
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,020
I'll keep giving you despair...

174
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,050
until you die!

175
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,160
Just what I thought! That spell leaves a
split-second opening right after you attack.

176
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,540
So you're already matching my pace.

177
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,750
You've got good speed and sharp
senses, I'll give you that!

178
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,420
Huh? My Thunderbolt Destruction
didn't work at all!

179
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,670
I'll play with you for a while!

180
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,470
You speedy little...

181
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,520
That battle maniac... Damn it.

182
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,520
So you're Magna, huh?

183
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,810
What a weird haircut.

184
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,800
I'm Luck. Nice to meet you.

185
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,280
Is this the guy who's called the Smiling
Combat Fiend and Luck the Cheery Berserker?

186
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,540
I need to show him who's boss.

187
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,120
Nice to meet you, too, loser.

188
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,460
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

189
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,460
Wow, what a funny face.

190
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,840
Ever since I joined the squad, he was an
annoying pest who messed with me constantly.

191
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,510
His personality was...

192
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,130
"This dude's got some serious issues."

193
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,300
Hot, hot, hot, hot...

194
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,170
Take that!

195
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,010
Hot!

196
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,440
Even on our missions,
he would do insane things.

197
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,290
Take that!

198
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,320
Huh?!

199
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,810
It's the Crackling Magna Typhoon!

200
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,900
I had no choice but to admit that
he has great battle instincts.

201
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,220
And since that dungeon mission,
he's gotten even stronger.

202
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,390
I hate to say it,
but you're my best friend.

203
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,190
Damn it...

204
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,940
Don't...

205
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,950
Don't you dare leave me behind, you dumbass!

206
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,330
Flame Creation Magic: Grand Slam!

207
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,750
I'm gonna crush it over here!

208
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,190
Nice, Magna!

209
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,850
Take that!

210
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,350
When I first met you, I underestimated you.

211
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,560
A peasant, huh? He looks boring.

212
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,320
But my instincts warned me...

213
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,610
They told me, "This guy's gonna
be dangerous, yet interesting."

214
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,370
You interested me so much
that I kept messing with you.

215
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,370
That pudding you were
saving sure was delicious.

216
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,160
That's going to be your last supper!

217
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,380
You always struck back at
me with everything you had.

218
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,300
I just now realized...

219
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,630
that you're my...

220
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,100
You're my...

221
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,650
That you're my very first friend.

222
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,350
Magna! I bet you've got even more in you!

223
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,860
Shut up!

224
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,290
Nice catch, Fireball Gangster!

225
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,400
Who are you calling a gangster?!

226
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,700
Get off me, Lightning Boy!

227
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,500
That's enough playtime, don't you think?

228
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,720
Bring it on, you jerk!

229
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,000
We're just about warmed up, too!

230
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,210
This way!

231
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,140
How can you tell when you
can't even sense mana?

232
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,130
I can't sense mana, but I can sense ki.

233
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,440
Ki? It's true that I sense a
strong magical power up ahead.

234
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,050
And it's incredibly powerful.

235
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,560
I've never felt anything like it before!

236
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,310
But as you said, we've got to do this!

237
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,320
Hey, your ki earlier...

238
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,320
It was hard to sense your presence.
How were you doing that?

239
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,830
Oh, by dancing, I unconsciously
put myself into a trance.

240
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,440
A trance?

241
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,030
When I'm in that state, my body moves
without me even having to think.

242
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,840
Then my opponents can't predict my movements.

243
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,880
I see! So that's actually possible...

244
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,840
All right!

245
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,650
Whatcha doin'?

246
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,100
Putting myself into a trance.

247
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,770
I've got a clear view of that magic now!

248
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,350
Flame and lightning magic are fighting!

249
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,690
Flame and lightning...
It must be Magna and Luck!

250
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,570
Their opponent has huge magic and...

251
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,190
What is this?

252
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,030
It's like hundreds of raging beasts!

253
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,480
It must be Vetto! Wait, you can tell all that?

254
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,330
My tribe's eyes are good at picking up magic.

255
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,920
But if this is who we're up against...

256
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,750
Nah.

257
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,920
Those two are crazy, but when it comes
down to it, they're both super reliable!

258
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,010
They definitely won't die!

259
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,430
Ow...

260
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,790
Do you finally get it?

261
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,440
The weak get eaten, and all
they have left is despair.

262
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,690
Despair?

263
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,150
Like we have time for that, you dumbass!

264
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,660
Yup...

265
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,200
If we were in despair...

266
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,430
We'd be too embarrassed to
act like his superiors again!

267
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,960
Not yet...

268
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,850
Not yet...

269
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,600
We know...

270
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,980
that if we fight him normally,
we probably won't stand a chance.

271
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,690
Not yet...

272
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,030
That's why... not yet!

273
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,110
That slight opening we have
right after he attacks...

274
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,540
Right now!

275
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,040
We'll hit him with all the magic we've got!

276
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,870
A simultaneous, full-power, body
and soul attack at close range?!

277
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,170
Is this what they were trying to do?

278
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,060
Magna... Luck...

279
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,640
This mana...

280
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,140
This power is insane.

281
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,650
Combo Magic: Flame Lightning
Explosive Cannon!

282
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,410
Magna! Luck!

283
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,350
Petit Clover

284
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,290
Petit Clover!

285
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,850
Crackling Magna Typhoon!

286
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,850
Crackling Magna Typhoon!

287
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,240
Hey, everyone! How are you doing?

288
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,440
We can't hear you! Put a little
more umph into it, damn it!

289
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,650
Today, we're going to show you how you can
do an easy Crackling Magna Typhoon at home.

290
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,500
First, have a string of lightning ready.

291
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,320
No one can do that!

292
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,520
Then, you wrap that lightning
string around Magna, like this.

293
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,840
It's electrocuting me!

294
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,970
Oh, you'll have to get your own Magna.

295
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,330
They can't do that, damn it!

296
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,550
Once you wrap the lightning
string around him,

297
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,250
you're going to spin him with
all your strength like a top.

298
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,270
Just like this! Take that!

299
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
And that's the Crackling Magna Typhoon.

300
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,620
Easy, right?

301
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,370
You're the only one who can do this, damn it!

302
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,010
Save me!

303
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,010
See you next time!

304
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,730
I'll never give up, no matter
how powerful my enemy is!

305
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,460
Not yet! I'm... We're the Black Bulls!

306
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,940
Black Clover, Page 45: " The Guy
Who Doesn't Know When to Quit."

307
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:54,250
Page 45
The Guy Who Doesn't Know When to Quit

308
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,960
That's right!

309
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,740
Not giving up is my magic!
