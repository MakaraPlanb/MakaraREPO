1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,700
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,220
Vetto from the Eye of the Midnight Sun
suddenly appeared before Asta and the others.

5
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,140
He came to steal the magic stone
that was in the Underwater Temple.

6
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,690
Let's go, Kiato!

7
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,980
You got it, Asta!

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,990
How boring.

9
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,530
Slow movements and weak attacks.

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,790
I suppose I can't expect more from
no-magic trash and hick scum.

11
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,660
You sure know how to hurt a
guy's feelings, you hairy gorilla.

12
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,090
We'll show you what happens when
trash and scum get serious!

13
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,840
Asta and Kiato struggled,
but Vetto was just too strong.

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,090
Did you get your hopes up?

15
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,310
These childish attacks won't work on me!

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,060
Not yet...

17
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,650
No-magic trash! Prancing around
with weapons too good for you...

18
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,110
So what?!

19
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,910
You never had any hope of winning.

20
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,450
Now... scream! Despair!

21
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,030
Ib I gwabe up...

22
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,090
Fu curd I brotec?

23
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,920
Huh?

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,930
He said, "If I gave up, who could I protect?"

25
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,630
Awakening

26
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,530
Noelle...

27
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,740
Kahono!

28
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,280
I see that you two are next.

29
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,830
Try to entertain me at least a little bit.

30
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,500
Dad...

31
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,170
Magna... Luck!

32
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,920
Asta!

33
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,260
Everyone was defeated so easily...

34
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,510
Just how strong is this guy?

35
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,480
Not yet!

36
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,480
Losers... can get lost!

37
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,900
Asta!

38
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,690
Song Magic: Rhythm Cushion!

39
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,880
Thanks, Kahono.

40
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,580
That'll just be a thousand yuls.

41
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,140
I'll pay you back a hundredfold.

42
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,880
Can you heal everyone with
your song recovery magic?

43
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,220
I can, but do you think that guy's
going to wait for me to finish singing?

44
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,100
That's...

45
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,310
Hey!

46
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,030
Big Brother! Why are you sleeping?!

47
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:09,780
What happened to our promise to become an
idol and dancer, and then become huge stars?!

48
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,790
We were going to become sibling
idols who could sing and dance!

49
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,870
That's right!

50
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,860
Huh? He's your big brother?

51
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,380
Yup. That moron over there
is my big brother, Kiato.

52
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,710
Who are you calling a moron?!

53
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,720
Ow...

54
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,930
If I hadn't softened the blow of
that punch with my dance magic,

55
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,790
he would've taken my head off.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,680
He's unbelievably strong.

57
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,480
But...

58
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,350
The two of us dream of going to the surface!

59
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,570
That's right! If we want to fulfill that dream,
we can't just sit around napping!

60
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,890
Let's go, Kahono!

61
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,740
Yeah!

62
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,630
Her mana's getting stronger?

63
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,130
Combo Spell:

64
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,010
Sea God Slash!

65
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,270
Sea God Slash is a song
and dance combo spell.

66
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,270
Dancing to Kahono's song
reinforces my dance magic,

67
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,530
and unleashes magic slashing attacks!

68
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,900
Amazing...

69
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,920
Kiato! Kahono!

70
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,420
You can do it! The two of you have got this!

71
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,170
You've worked so hard ever
since you were little.

72
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,790
I guess that's enough for today.

73
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,680
No way. We'll never get rich if
this was enough to tire us out.

74
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,710
You're right. We can't become stars that way.

75
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:25,110
Yup. Besides, we need to make sure our
song and dance will please the sea god.

76
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,840
Yeah, so we need to work harder.

77
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,290
Okay, let's do this.

78
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,090
Yeah!

79
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,610
Your hard work...

80
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,610
...won't betray you!

81
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,780
Oh? All this power

82
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,410
from a little bird's song
and a mouse's dance.

83
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,120
Frontier magic is truly intriguing.

84
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,630
That's right! This spell was
created because we're here!

85
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,000
We served the sea god, praying,
singing and dancing...

86
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,510
We spent a long time that way,
weaving the magic into our lives!

87
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,220
That's right! Ever since we were
little, we've offered up this song

88
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,500
and dance to the sea god
and the rest of our people!

89
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,770
This spell...

90
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,850
...is our bond with the people

91
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,270
of the Underwater Temple!

92
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,560
You can do it!

93
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,070
Kiato! Kahono!

94
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,820
Go, Kiato! Kahono!

95
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,690
We're not going to let you...

96
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,120
...break that bond!

97
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,120
Did they do it?

98
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,510
So what?

99
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,380
No way...

100
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,140
Wha...

101
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,250
Kiato!

102
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,490
Big Brother!

103
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,920
Kiato!

104
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,460
Run, Kahono!

105
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,610
Dreams? Bonds?

106
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:43,350
People like you have no right
to talk about such things!

107
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,730
Kahono!

108
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,420
Curse you!

109
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,860
Game Magic: Monster Toy!

110
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,080
Every last one of you thinks
this is some child's game.

111
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,170
We're the ones who truly
have dreams and bonds...

112
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,490
We, the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

113
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,480
The ones you broke...

114
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,890
Our golden dreams and our bonds of blood!

115
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,160
What is that fool talking about?

116
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,150
You devil!

117
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,410
Now you won't be able to perform your
silly songs and dances ever again.

118
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,020
In other words, your cheap little
dreams just went down the drain.

119
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,620
Well, weakling? You grounded little bird...

120
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,540
Did you get a good taste of despair?

121
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,640
I don't like those eyes.

122
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,120
In that case, I'll have to rip
off your wings one by one...

123
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,090
A bird that can't sing has no reason to live.

124
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,530
I'll just...

125
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,920
Stop!

126
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,660
Let her go!

127
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,410
You think you can stop me with words?

128
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,080
If I miss, I might hit Kahono...

129
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,840
You never had any hope of winning.

130
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,880
Now... scream! Despair!

131
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,960
I couldn't attack earlier, either.

132
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,940
In any case, would my attacks
even work on someone like him?

133
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,890
Are you finished? Then just
watch from there, you loser.

134
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,420
Everyone's fighting, even though
they're getting torn to pieces.

135
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,920
And yet, I...

136
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,730
I...

137
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,920
It's all right.

138
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,930
Kahono?

139
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,280
That immense power inside you...

140
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,190
You'll be able to control it now, Noelle!

141
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,990
Because you're fighting to protect
what's important to you.

142
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,420
You're fighting to win!

143
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,570
What's important to me?

144
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,570
You'll be fine! There's no doubt about it...

145
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,960
Because I'm your friend, and I say so!

146
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,020
Hey...

147
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,230
It's shaking?

148
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,250
Wh-What's going on?

149
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,120
So you finally showed up,

150
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,600
Noelle!

151
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,330
I'll tell you one more time.

152
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,420
What is this power?

153
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,800
Let my friend go!

154
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,350
Black Bulls girl,

155
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,140
you're not letting what your
siblings said get to you, are you?

156
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,940
There's no time for that on the battlefield!

157
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,520
One wrong decision and a life could be lost!

158
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,200
You're standing here right now
as a member of the Magic Knights!

159
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,340
If you joined the Magic Knights
of your own free will,

160
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,540
then steel yourself and get stronger!

161
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,700
Steel myself?

162
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,340
Being weak is nothing to be ashamed of.

163
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,960
However, staying weak is!

164
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,100
Let my friend go!

165
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,280
This power...

166
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,600
Girl, you're royalty?

167
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,820
So what if I am?

168
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,110
That has nothing to do with this!

169
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm Noelle Silva of the Black Bulls!

170
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,320
How dare you hurt my friends and comrades?!

171
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,700
I see...

172
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,870
I knew it.

173
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,140
You're from the most corrupt clan!

174
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,050
Very well!

175
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,460
Come at me with all of your strength!

176
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,900
I'll force you and that
sinful mana to your knees!

177
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,190
I'll defeat you,

178
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,900
whether you ask me to or not!

179
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,880
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

180
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,580
Th-The sea god?

181
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,020
I did it!

182
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,490
Take a look at that power!

183
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,610
Noelle, you little... I think you
might've killed your limits there.

184
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,450
She's the sea god incarnate...
No, she's a goddess!

185
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,570
I always figured she had
incredible latent ability,

186
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,660
but who would've thought she
was such an attack mage?

187
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,400
Come live with me.

188
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,000
It's not you who should despair.

189
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,140
It's the people of the Clover Kingdom.

190
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,600
Remember...

191
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,960
your true self.

192
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,850
May you two be happy!

193
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,450
What...

194
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,330
This can't be!

195
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,130
The humans?!

196
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,850
I'll kill them!

197
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,530
Impressive... You managed
to draw me out, human.

198
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,930
What's with that eye?

199
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,930
And this eerie magic I've
never felt before...

200
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,000
Mythical Beast Magic...

201
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,740
N-No way!

202
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,230
What in the world is that?

203
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,710
He regrew the arm he lost?

204
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,750
There isn't any magic like that!

205
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:15,250
The best that even the most powerful
recovery spell can do is close wounds.

206
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,780
These guys aren't just terrorists.

207
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,890
They're something weirder...
Something abominable!

208
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,390
Run... Get out of there, Noelle!

209
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,890
Run?

210
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,530
I...

211
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,910
won't run!

212
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,530
That's some fine resolve for an insect.

213
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,170
Now, it's payback time.

214
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,510
Vanish!

215
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,020
Mythical Beast Magic...

216
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,250
Sea Dragon's...

217
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,490
That last spell drained all my magic!

218
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,600
A-Asta!

219
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,140
Kid!

220
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,990
Not yet...

221
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,650
Not yet, damn it!

222
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,030
We haven't given up yet!

223
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,030
Not yet? Yes, not yet!

224
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,970
Starting now, I'll show you true despair!

225
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,340
Petit Clover

226
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,480
Petit Clover!

227
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,850
Mythical Beast Magic!

228
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,850
Mythical Beast Magic!

229
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,030
Hey, what were you saying during
your mythical beast magic spells?

230
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,670
Very well, insect. I'll tell you.

231
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,980
Who are you calling an insect?! I'm royalty!

232
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,530
This is the spell!

233
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,350
Easy, right? Read it.

234
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,740
I can't read that.

235
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,770
It's...

236
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,440
Say what?

237
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,320
It's...

238
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,130
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers?

239
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,400
That's not it at all!

240
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,960
It's...

241
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,030
The only difference between a
whale and a dolphin is their size?

242
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,590
Udon

243
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,710
Somen

244
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,840
Hiyamugi

245
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,890
The only difference between udon, somen,
and hiyamugi is how thick they are!

246
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,550
Hawk

247
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,550
Eagle

248
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,240
Apparently hawks and eagles
are the same birds, too.

249
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,550
I did not know that!

250
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,490
Of course I knew that! I'm a royal!

251
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,770
What were we talking about again?

252
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,810
Insects, I'm getting tired
of your incessant buzzing!

253
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,690
I'll crush you with my own hands, one by one!

254
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,860
Black Clover, Page 47: "The Only Weapon."

255
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:54,250
Page 47
The Only Weapon

256
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,740
My magic is Mythical Beast Magic!
