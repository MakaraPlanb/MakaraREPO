1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,660
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,150
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,820
The One I've Set My Heart On

5
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,050
Finral Roulacase, a member of the Black
Bulls Magic Knights Squad, was troubled.

6
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,110
It was a very important matter.

7
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,660
What do I do? What should I do?

8
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,410
Finral's troubles had nothing
to do with a mission...

9
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,560
...about tonight's mixer?

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,400
A mixer, meaning a gathering
between men and women.

11
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,250
It is a dinner intended to help
men and women get acquainted.

12
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,480
When I set this up, three girls
agreed to come, and that's great!

13
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,880
The more girls, the merrier!

14
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,730
But the problem is who
else I'm going to bring.

15
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,980
Asta's a delight, so I'm bringing him
for sure. I just need one more...

16
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,970
Hup!

17
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,660
Flame Magic:

18
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,160
Exploding...

19
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,060
Fireball!

20
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,870
Home run!

21
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,210
Didja see that?

22
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,680
This is what truly makes a man!

23
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,680
Yeah, no. I know there are girls
who like delinquents, but...

24
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,070
Pleased to meet ya!
My Crazy Cyclone's on fire!

25
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,260
This is what truly makes a man!
Brr-r-r-rm, brr-r-r-rm!

26
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,670
Magna's too much of a delinquent.
He'd just scare them off.

27
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,390
Almost... I'm almost done

28
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,340
with my life-size statue of Marie.

29
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,220
Ah, Marie. It feels like
you're right next to me!

30
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,370
My beloved little sister, Marie!

31
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,850
Ah, you truly are an angel!

32
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,850
Yeah, no. Even if I took him to a mixer...

33
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,110
Marie's more of an angel than any of you.

34
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,700
I want to have a mixer
with a hundred Maries.

35
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,140
Yes. Marie was already an angel
before she was even born.

36
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,550
Ugh... A sister complex?

37
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,570
Really?

38
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,810
He'd definitely scare them away!

39
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,550
I heard that you were having a mixer.

40
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,430
You want me to come with you?

41
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,150
Yeah, I have no idea what Gordon's
thinking, so that's not happening.

42
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,150
No, really. You don't need to hold back.
It's not as if I don't like girls.

43
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,980
It might be fun to bring Charmy along,
since she's sort of like a mascot character.

44
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,940
But...

45
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,380
Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...

46
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,740
This is so yummy, too!

47
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,120
Excuse me, could I get seconds?

48
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,660
I do apologize. It's only been
five minutes since we opened,

49
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,830
but we're out of ingredients,
so we must close for the day.

50
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,790
D'oh!

51
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,650
The mixer'd be over in five minutes!

52
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,980
At least, that's what I assume would happen.

53
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,550
Maybe I could take Vanessa...

54
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,600
But she's a woman!

55
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,390
Let's not.

56
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,430
Now this is paradise.

57
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,710
Maybe I could go all-out and invite Yami...

58
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,310
I'm sure there are girls
who like older guys.

59
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,490
Yami does hate gaudy types, though.

60
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,530
Why the hell are you three
dressed like that, huh?

61
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,190
Aren't you showing too much skin?

62
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,170
What if you catch a cold?
Put something warm over your stomachs!

63
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,860
Uh...

64
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,140
Not happening.

65
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,170
So overbearing.

66
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,340
Maybe not.

67
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,760
Basically, that leaves...

68
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,180
A mixer? Yeah, sure.

69
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,350
Great! Thanks for agreeing to come.

70
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,360
Well, Luck looks decent,
so I'm sure things will work out.

71
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,690
So, what's a mixer, anyway?

72
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,700
Will this actually work out?

73
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,800
All right, it looks like we're all set.

74
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,500
Should we go dressed like this?

75
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,530
We have to make sure they know
that we're Magic Knights.

76
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,750
Magic Knights are the most admired figures
in the Clover Kingdom, after all.

77
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,450
Got it!

78
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,990
Are mixers strong? I'm so excited!

79
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,300
Yeah! I'm excited, too!

80
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,970
Well, let's go.

81
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,500
Come on. Hurry on through.

82
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,490
Got it!

83
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,520
Can I go, too? I promise
I won't get in the way...

84
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,740
City in the Common Realm: Nean

85
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,740
Hup!

86
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,290
I-I'm in the clear.

87
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,380
Sneak... Sneak, sneak... Sneak, sneak, sneak.

88
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,500
When I heard they were going to a mixer,

89
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,470
I was so worried, I ended up following them.

90
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,940
I can't believe this. Why are
they going to a mixer?

91
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,470
This is the problem with lowly fools.

92
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,460
I-I mean, it's not as if I like that
muscle-brained shrimp or anything!

93
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,510
I don't care who he hangs out
with or what happens after that!

94
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,610
Wait, who am I even making excuses to?!

95
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm pretty sure it was
somewhere around here.

96
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,240
Oh, there it is!

97
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,950
The Dreavy Hinker

98
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,760
Okay! Looks like we all have our drinks,
so let's get right to the introductions!

99
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,180
I'll go ahead and start.

100
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:27,690
Finral Roulacase
21-Year-Old Member of the Black Bulls From Touta

101
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,470
I'm 21 years old and from Touta!

102
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,890
I'm Finral Roulacase, the spatial
magic user from the Black Bulls!

103
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,690
Nice to meet you!

104
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,130
These are freshly picked moon blossoms.

105
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,450
Please take them as a
token of our friendship.

106
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,770
Wow! They're beautiful!

107
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,450
These only bloom at night
on Mount Anahu, right?

108
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,300
They smell so nice!

109
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,200
Thanks...

110
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,920
Hook, line, and sinker! I'm finally
going to get a girlfriend!

111
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,670
But for that to happen, I need both
Asta and Luck to do their best.

112
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,470
Go on, introduce yourselves.

113
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,210
Introduce myself...

114
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,630
Am I just supposed to say what I like?

115
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,470
Okay.

116
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:06,500
Luck Voltia
18-Year-Old Member of the Black Bulls From Ibon

117
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,110
I'm Luck Voltia, and I'm 18 years old.
I'm from Ibon and belong to the Black Bulls.

118
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,530
My hobbies include fighting tough
enemies in bloody, mortal combat!

119
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,320
Isn't "fighting for your life"
a wonderful phrase?

120
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,700
Introduce myself... A manly man should
probably talk about his dreams.

121
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,730
Right...

122
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:30,150
Asta
15-Year-Old Member of the Black Bulls From Hage Village

123
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,460
I-I'm Asta. I'm fifteen. I'm from Hage
Village. I'm a member of the Black Bulls!

124
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,880
Um... my dream is to become
the Wizard King someday!

125
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,180
The Wizard King?

126
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,380
That'll never happen.
He's just a kid, anyway.

127
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,260
These two seem kinda...

128
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,260
How d'ya like these biceps?

129
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,390
...sketchy.

130
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,390
I mean, I heard they'd be Magic Knights,

131
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,390
but they just had to be Black Bulls,
the lowest of the low?

132
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,790
And if he's from Hage, isn't he a peasant?

133
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,110
Like, a total peasant?

134
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,180
I'd never go out with any of these guys
if they didn't earn more than me.

135
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,600
And if they're younger, shorter,
and socially beneath me...

136
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,360
Not happening.

137
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,950
Crap... This seems to be going south.

138
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,990
Okay! We've introduced ourselves,
so now it's your turn, girls!

139
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,930
Let's keep things rolling! Yeah!

140
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,590
We're passing the baton to you!

141
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,540
Um... We're friends.

142
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:22,120
Rebecca Scarlet

143
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:22,120
Helene Barbary

144
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:22,120
Erika Sitate

145
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,990
I'm Erika. I work at a dressmaker shop.

146
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,630
I'm Helene, and I work as a hairdresser.

147
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,420
Rebecca. I work at a restaurant.

148
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,930
They're clearly losing interest!

149
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,410
Wow, so you all have
solid jobs. That's great!

150
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,060
Say, I'd love to hear about your work.

151
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,620
I'd love it if you made some clothes for me.
What do you think would look good on me?

152
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,530
Maybe you could cut my hair sometime.

153
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,150
I've been thinking of
changing up my hairstyle.

154
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,320
Could I eat at your place sometime?

155
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,790
No reaction whatsoever! I need to think
of something they'd be interested in!

156
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,330
W-Want to hear about the Magic Knights?

157
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,310
Yeah, tell us!

158
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,860
I'd love to!

159
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,780
Bingo!

160
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:59,210
That's great to hear. Well, I use spatial
magic to go to all sorts of places.

161
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,680
Something I've done recently at my job...

162
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,800
Yes?

163
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,260
Crap.

164
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,530
Hey. Send me to the john.

165
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,550
Yes, sir.

166
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,450
Hey. Send me to the bath.

167
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,270
Yes, sir.

168
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,820
Hey. Send me to my bed.

169
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,860
Yes, sir.

170
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,280
I don't think I've done anything lately
other than move Yami around.

171
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,300
Luck! You've been working hard!
What have you done recently?

172
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,290
Me?

173
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,370
Tell them something interesting
you've done at work lately.

174
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,710
Helene and the other girls
really want to know.

175
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,370
Work, huh? Let's see... Oh!

176
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,540
The other day, we ran into
a group of ten bandits...

177
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,750
Yes, and?

178
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,940
...and I beat them all to a pulp!

179
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,740
It was so brutal! And so much fun!

180
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,680
I could've easily killed them all,
but I just broke three of their bones.

181
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,220
It completely backfired!

182
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,100
Oh, and when I fought this mage, I—

183
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,640
Right. Thanks, Luck!

184
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,580
Now, go on and eat up, my boy!

185
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,870
Oh, I'm done?

186
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,110
I'd love to hear what Asta's been up to!

187
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,530
You protected the people of the
royal capital, didn't you? Great job!

188
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,570
Y-Yes! I did!

189
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,830
Oh, you mean the incident the other day?

190
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,510
When the capital was attacked?

191
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,080
Yup! Asta worked really
hard and got promoted!

192
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,370
Really?

193
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,000
Hey, this is going well. We just need to keep
taking the conversation in this direction!

194
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,420
You must be amazing!

195
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,850
Well, I didn't manage to protect myself.
They put three holes in me.

196
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,350
They hurt like hell!

197
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,860
Hey, it's all squishy!

198
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,100
Ow! Hey, don't poke at them.

199
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,340
These two are useless!

200
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,940
I should've known a mixer
wouldn't work with these two!

201
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,360
All of our members suck!

202
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,650
Ow, ow, ow! Come on, stop!

203
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,070
Hey, are you mad?

204
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,910
No, but...

205
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,110
I heard them mention a mixer,
so I ended up tagging along.

206
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,970
But thankfully, it doesn't
seem to be going well.

207
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,180
Like I said! I don't care
what happens to Shrimpsta!

208
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,550
Hey!

209
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,580
Hey, waitress!

210
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
Huh?

211
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,890
Get me another beer!

212
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,390
Get it yourself, insect.

213
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,650
What?

214
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,610
So you know about that huge incident
at the capital the other day?

215
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,930
I just happened to be on bodyguard duty
for a VIP in the capital that day,

216
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,820
and just happened to defeat
a number of the intruders.

217
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,430
Bah-ha!

218
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,220
They gave me an exceptional promotion

219
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,750
and bumped me up to
Intermediate Magic Knight all at once!

220
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,620
It's a such a hassle, really.

221
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,540
It's not like I'm even that talented.

222
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,210
Bah-ha...

223
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,010
Whoops. Maybe I'm a little intoxicated...

224
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,940
with myself.

225
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,510
Oh, and you were looking at a
dirty mag during all that, right?

226
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,970
Hey, what are you talking
about? Of course not!

227
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,190
Shh, shh!

228
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,580
What's wrong? You guys
nervous to be around us?

229
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,440
Bah-ha! You don't have to be so nervous.

230
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,510
He just squeezed lemon all over
the fried chicken without asking first.

231
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,740
At least ask first...

232
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,370
What the heck is this mixer from hell?

233
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,970
I'm pretty sure I've seen this
guy before. He's, um...

234
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,800
Bah-ha!

235
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000
Right! Bah-ha!

236
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,570
To think that my bronze magic
would be so formidable.

237
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,260
I even terrify myself.

238
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,350
You there, waitress! Get me another drink!

239
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,640
Bah-ha!

240
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,640
Hurgh!

241
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,640
Herf herf!

242
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,260
Nice!

243
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,600
Oh, so that's the kind of magic
you use when you cut hair.

244
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,610
Yup. I just go like this.

245
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,610
It doesn't take much magic, but you
need really good control! Show me more!

246
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,380
Huh? Oh, sure...

247
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,130
His eyes are so pure.

248
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,170
He has such a cute smile,
but there's danger behind it.

249
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,840
I think I might like that gap
more than I want to admit.

250
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,370
Crap... I think I'm starting
to like bad boys.

251
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,500
Hey, could you show me your magic, too, Luck?

252
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,190
Sure! It's a bit cramped
in here, so let's go outside.

253
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,330
Okay!

254
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,770
Well done, Luck!

255
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,310
And the sunrise looks really
beautiful from there.

256
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,050
Really?

257
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,060
I'll take you there with my
spatial magic sometime.

258
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,470
Want to go camping with me?

259
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,190
I think I might like that.

260
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,690
Hey, want another drink? Excuse me,
could we get another drink?

261
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,450
He's a bit gaudy and not really my type,
but he's the best out of the three.

262
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,490
He seems like a noble, and spatial magic
would be really handy.

263
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,950
Plus, he's considerate and kind.

264
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,660
Say, want to step out to the patio?

265
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,330
I guess I wouldn't mind.

266
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,580
I wasn't sure how things
would go for a second,

267
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,220
but I think things might just work out!

268
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,850
This is so awkward.

269
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,900
Why does this lady keep
looking away and down?

270
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,230
Is she mad? Did I do
something to make her mad?

271
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,530
Not good. I need to liven things up.

272
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,980
I'm not really sure how,
but I have to liven things up!

273
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,860
Right! It's my turn!

274
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,800
Um...

275
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,050
What's your favorite food?

276
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,860
I love tatoes.

277
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,300
You don't have to force yourself
to make small talk. This is dumb.

278
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,530
Erika told me that I should
find a good guy for the sake

279
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,200
of my siblings, so I came along.

280
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,800
But this isn't the real me, and I'm
too worried about my siblings at home.

281
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,180
So you live with your siblings?

282
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,540
I have three younger brothers
and two younger sisters.

283
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,850
Really? That's nice.

284
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,050
Oh, I have five siblings, too,
though we're not related by blood.

285
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,610
I'm not with them right now,
but they're all a bunch of little brats.

286
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,940
They annoyed me sometimes,
but we had so much fun.

287
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,220
We used to all sleep in the same bed.

288
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,550
Now that I'm in the Magic Knights, I get
my own room, so it's a little easier,

289
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,460
but not having those fidgety little brats
sleeping next to me gets a bit lonely, too.

290
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,490
Yeah! They can be a pain, but it
gets lonely when they're not around!

291
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,910
Exactly! And you can act like a
dork in front of your friends,

292
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,220
but you always want to impress your siblings!

293
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,160
I totally get that!

294
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,610
Hey! They're actually having fun?!

295
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,540
Wh-What the heck's going on?

296
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,980
H-Hey! What do you think you're doing?

297
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,130
You just asked for a job out
of the blue, so I hired you,

298
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,650
but then you blew away some customers!
Who do you think you are?

299
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,620
Silence, insect.

300
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,940
What?!

301
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,990
Come to think of it, you seem
like a big sister, Rebecca.

302
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,990
You definitely don't seem
like the oldest, though.

303
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,460
I have one brother who's the
same age as me named Yuno...

304
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,420
Well, well...

305
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,500
You look like you're having fun,
o great Magic Knight.

306
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,350
Aren't you a little small to be one?

307
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,080
Are you really a Magic Knight?

308
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,770
If a little twerp like you got in,
I could probably get in, too.

309
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,500
Yeah, I'm surprised I made it in, too.

310
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,210
And being out with a flashy little
thing like this? I sure envy you.

311
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,250
Bet you're desperate to catch yourself
a Magic Knight, aren't ya, missy?

312
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,730
Pretty sure I've seen you somewhere before.

313
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,120
Oh, you're the girl who works
at the local restaurant,

314
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
always carrying a kid on your back and
working until you're drenched in sweat.

315
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,820
Are all those brats yours? That must
mean your man walked out on you.

316
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,510
No! That was my brother!

317
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,580
Well, then, of course you'd like
to get yourself a Magic Knight

318
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,720
and enjoy the easy life.

319
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,430
If you want a man that much,

320
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,930
come hang out with me.

321
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,770
Hey! Let go of me!

322
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,480
I don't know what your deal is, mister,
but don't judge people by their appearances!

323
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,490
You don't know anything about her, do you?

324
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,930
Ooh, scary!

325
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:07,250
What kind of amazing magic are you
gonna show me, widdle Magic Knight?

326
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,710
I can't use magic.

327
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,530
What? A Magic Knight that can't use magic?

328
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,690
What kind of lousy joke is that?

329
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,710
But...

330
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,540
Hup!

331
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,530
Okay, time to go home.

332
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,130
That was a waste of time.

333
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,610
Let's get more drinks somewhere else.

334
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,230
H-Hey, sir!

335
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,800
Let's get out of here!

336
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,860
H-Huh?

337
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,340
Hey!

338
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,130
Hey, boss! I quit!

339
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,740
What?! Hey!

340
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,150
Thanks, Asta. I feel so much better!

341
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,390
Nah. Sorry for ruining the mixer.

342
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,020
It's fine.

343
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,430
He's a bit short, but he's actually...

344
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:24,280
Hey, Asta... D-Do you have
anyone that you like?

345
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,780
Yup! There's somebody
I've got my heart set on!

346
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,330
What?!

347
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,050
I see.

348
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,860
I'm sure she's a wonderful person.

349
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,220
She is! We're from the same—

350
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,330
I wish you both the best.

351
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,670
Thanks!

352
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,180
Hey, come by my restaurant sometime.

353
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,700
You can play with my siblings.

354
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,020
I will!

355
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,230
"Same"?

356
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:53,510
The same squad?! Then... could...
could that mean... mean m-m-m-me...

357
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,940
No! No, no, no! And what if it is?!

358
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,230
It's not like I th-think... anything... anything of...

359
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,530
Sister, we spent so many
years together in Hage.

360
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,500
One day, I'll become the
Wizard King and come for you!

361
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,870
Please marry me then!

362
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,740
Just because I'm supporting him
doesn't mean I'm going to give up.

363
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,540
By the way, what's the
point of a mixer, anyway?

364
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,840
What?!

365
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,380
What?!

366
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,460
Apparently he threw some drunkard to
the ground. Black Bulls are so violent!

367
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,930
Right? Let's go home!

368
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,300
She shot me down...

369
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,360
Petit Clover

370
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,810
Petit Clover!

371
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,870
If Gordon, Grey, and Sekke
Went to a Mixer Together

372
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,870
If Gordon, Grey, and Sekke
Went to a Mixer Together.

373
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,870
Bah-ha! Bah-ha! Bah-ha-ha-haha!

374
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,550
I'm Helene.

375
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,870
I'm Erika.

376
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,140
I'm Gordon.

377
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,960
I'm so happy to be at a mixer
with people as cute as you two.

378
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,130
Will you be my friend? You will? Thanks!

379
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,130
Bah-ha!

380
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,380
Could we exchange contact info?
I'll write you a letter.

381
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,380
Bah-ha-ha!

382
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,390
Bah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

383
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,290
I want to go home.

384
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,940
I'm going to become the Wizard King!

385
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm not going to lose to anyone!

386
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,730
I'll prove that even peasants
can move up the ranks!

388

Page 29
Path

389
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,740
Not yet! Not yet! Not giving up is my magic!
