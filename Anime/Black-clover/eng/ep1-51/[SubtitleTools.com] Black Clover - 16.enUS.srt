1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,940
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,540
Yuno, we're family, right?

5
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,870
Yeah.

6
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,810
But we don't share the same blood.

7
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,140
Yeah.

8
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,070
But we're more connected than
people who share the same blood.

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,150
What brought this on?

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,900
I'm saying...

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,980
We don't have any blood relatives,

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,370
but all of the friends we've made...

13
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,450
And all the friends we're going to make...

14
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,870
Let's treat them just like they're family.

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,360
Yeah.

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,350
We're almost there. Once we
get through this tunnel...

17
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,140
How amazing!

18
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,150
That's all there is to dungeons?

19
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,240
I wonder how you get in.

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,900
It appears the Black Bulls aren't here yet.

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,330
Of course not. There's no way they'd beat us.

22
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,830
Indeed.

23
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,880
Mimosa!

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,550
She's an expert at sensing mana,
but she didn't notice?

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,040
That wasn't a trap spell...
What is this magic?

26
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,680
Who are you?!

27
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,520
Who stands in my way?

28
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,700
Move.

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,320
Friends you can trust are
worth their weight in gold.

30
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,130
Sorry, but stay there a while and get weaker.

31
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,050
Win...

32
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,330
Win...

33
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,340
Keep winning, Luck!

34
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,390
Wait.

35
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,450
It's been a while

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,780
since things actually got interesting.

37
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,590
More... More!

38
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,950
Let's fight some more!

39
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,250
I'd rather not pluck a bud
that's still so young...

40
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,810
I would always close my eyes

41
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,010
And cower at reality

42
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,770
I can't stand the idea

43
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,160
Of just making excuses to give up

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,410
Stand right there

45
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,490
I don't want to be near you

46
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,520
Any minute now

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,880
Just wait right there

48
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,880
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

49
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,040
Black and blue

50
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,990
I'll give up on giving up

51
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,410
And get the world on my side

52
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,760
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

53
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,100
Every time somewhere under this sky

54
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:19,180
Break through the tearful nights

55
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,400
And head where the light shines

56
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,230
I want to keep my promise

57
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,790
I'll deliver it to you

58
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,820
shape of love

59
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,530
Friends

60
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,890
Luck!

61
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,100
Why can't you do something so simple?

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,810
How many times must I tell you?

63
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,040
Why are you smiling like that?

64
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,160
Why can't you cry or get angry?

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,740
Why were you born that way?!

66
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,930
H-Hey...

67
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,400
You're kidding, right?

68
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,350
One of the common students defeated a noble...

69
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,690
That's never happened before in our
school's magic exchange competition.

70
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,930
It's not normal for a
commoner to beat a noble.

71
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,810
Crap, I was picking on him.
He might try to get me back.

72
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,550
He's always smiling... He's super creepy.

73
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,250
Don't get involved with him.
He'll beat you to a pulp.

74
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,710
You won against a noble using magic?

75
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,170
That's amazing, Luck!

76
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,470
I had no idea you had such powers!

77
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,990
Normally, no one can beat a noble.

78
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,370
You must be special!

79
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,970
Keep winning.

80
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,580
Win, win, and keep on
winning with your powers.

81
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,050
No one will help you in this world.

82
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,490
You must use your own powers.

83
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,750
If that will make you happy, Mother.

84
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,400
Win...

85
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,950
So dangerous.

86
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,670
You've become faster and sharper.

87
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,520
Win...

88
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,410
I'll keep winning!

89
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,510
With my powers!

90
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,270
Sorry, but I can't afford to lose, either.

91
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,320
Smoke Creation Magic: Binding Cross Prison.

92
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,200
Solid smoke? I can't move.

93
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,700
This uses up a lot of magic,
so I really didn't want to use it.

94
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,460
I'm out of gas.

95
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,220
You won't be able to zip around anymore, kid.

96
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,630
Now, then... I wonder how our kid is doing.

97
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,850
Ouchie!

98
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,250
He's not very good at communicating...

99
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,980
Maybe it's the generation gap?

100
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,990
Plant Recovery Magic:

101
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,280
Dream-Healing Flower Cradle.

102
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:11,170
I'm so sorry... I'm supposed to be
the healer, and I went down first.

103
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,930
Don't think about unnecessary things.
Right now, concentrate on healing yourself.

104
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,930
That crest... Is he one of the invading
mages from the Diamond Kingdom?

105
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,940
You scoundrel!

106
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,320
You dare attack someone from behind?
Is that something a warrior should do?

107
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

108
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,530
What?

109
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,690
You're all the same.
Just pebbles by the wayside.

110
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,130
Back me up, Yuno!

111
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,040
Right.

112
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,140
You Diamond scum! I'll show you the
true power of Clover's Golden Dawn!

113
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,640
All right! This path is a cinch to go down!

114
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,460
The mana is getting denser.

115
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,070
Is the treasure chamber really this way?

116
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,700
Whoa... What's wrong?

117
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,190
This magic is probably Luck's.
I think he's fighting.

118
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,630
Seriously?

119
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,010
I wonder if that means the
enemy really did invade.

120
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,290
The enemy? We have to go help him out!

121
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,840
But...

122
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,460
Maybe it's better to just
leave the fighting to Luck.

123
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,370
If the enemy really got in, I'm sure
they're after the treasure chamber.

124
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,060
It might be better to head over there first.

125
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:49,560
We need to take care of this mission fast
so Diamond's people won't steal anything.

126
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,570
At this rate, the Golden Dawn
will get ahead of us, too.

127
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,090
Win... I have to keep
winning with my powers...

128
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,300
Looks like there's something tying you down.

129
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,810
What I want... is going away...

130
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,810
Huh? What was the thing I wanted?

131
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,040
He's using such powerful
attacks without a grimoire.

132
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,040
Not only that, it doesn't appear
that he's losing any magic.

133
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,290
If this goes on...

134
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,760
Yuno! You head to the treasure
chamber while I'm fighting him!

135
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,510
He's strong. If you fight him
without support, even you won't...

136
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,940
Just hurry up and go!

137
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,520
Frankly, I'd rather not leave
this to a peasant like you!

138
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,480
But it's for our kingdom! Fulfill our duty!

139
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,820
That's right, you fool.

140
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,030
Curses!

141
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,750
I'll set you free...

142
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,800
Yuno, we're family, right?

143
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,560
But we're more connected than
people who share the same blood.

144
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,710
Looks like we've got another lively one.

145
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,570
What brought this on?

146
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,560
Why did you come back?!

147
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,280
I'm saying...

148
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,780
And who might you be?

149
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,730
I'm...

150
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,890
We don't have any blood relatives,

151
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,460
but all of the friends we've made...

152
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,330
You should be concentrating on the mission!

153
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,500
And all the friends we're going to make...

154
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,060
Let's treat them just like they're family.

155
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,510
No...

156
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,350
...his friend!

157
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,350
We're friends!

158
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,070
Yuno! You head to the treasure
chamber while I'm fighting him!

159
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,370
That's right, you fool.

160
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,600
Curses!

161
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,470
I'll set you free...

162
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,520
Why did you come back, you fool?!

163
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,690
You need to hurry up and
get to the treasure chamber,

164
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,960
for the sake of the Clover Kingdom!

165
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,140
Let's defeat him and go together.

166
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,240
All three of us!

167
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,020
Now you're gonna have to face us, old man!

168
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,690
Oh, dear... Having your friends show
up is definitely not in my favor.

169
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,310
Apparently, she just suddenly dropped dead.

170
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,210
She always seemed to be
under a lot of stress.

171
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,330
And now her kid's all alone... How awful.

172
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,130
Well, I'm not so sure.
Her kid's sort of weird.

173
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,840
Despite the fact that his mother just died...

174
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,090
He's...

175
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,720
Luck?

176
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,830
He's my prey.

177
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,260
Win...

178
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,730
I'm going to win and keep offering
those victories to my mom.

179
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,610
I'll take care of him myself.

180
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,240
I don't need any friends. Just my powers...

181
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,950
Hey, what are you—

182
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,580
Otherwise, Mom won't accept me.

183
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,920
Have it your way.

184
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,750
Hey!

185
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,420
Guess I shouldn't be holding back anymore.

186
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,840
I... I... I need to...

187
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,530
make Mom accept me...

188
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,020
or I'll be all alone!

189
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,530
Do whatever you want!
And I'll do what I want!

190
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,740
I'll do this alone...

191
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,620
I won't leave you alone!

192
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,630
Not yet!

193
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,130
Some part of me...

194
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,110
I don't care what you think about me!

195
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,640
Do whatever you want!

196
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,240
...was trying not to realize...

197
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:07,900
I've already acknowledged
you as my... as our friend!

198
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,170
...that I had friends I could rely on.

199
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,320
I'm sorry, Mom. I...

200
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,790
wasn't alone.

201
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,440
True, it seems like it'd be more
fun if we all fought together.

202
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,810
Yeah!

203
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,690
Well, this isn't good at all.

204
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,360
You're going to make an old man get serious.

205
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,080
Smoke Creation Magic:
Prison of the Fallen King.

206
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,410
You won't be able to get away anymore, kids.

207
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,430
No matter who we're facing,

208
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,430
we, the Black Bulls, will win!

209
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,440
I'm going to get serious now.

210
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,940
What are you...

211
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:42,450
Wind Creation Magic: Swift White Hawk
and Wind Blade Shower.

212
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,460
Simultaneous spell activation?!

213
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,960
And this power... H-He's...

214
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,090
It will be the Golden Dawn that
reaches the treasure chamber first!

215
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,850
Take that!

216
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,520
I cut and cut, but there's
no end! It keeps coming back!

217
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,290
I'm getting dizzy...

218
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,990
The smoke just keeps getting thicker.

219
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,340
At this rate, we're going to suffocate.

220
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,720
This isn't good. We have to
hurry up and defeat that mage.

221
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,050
I can pretty much tell
where he is with my magic,

222
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,890
but he'll probably dodge, even if I attack.

223
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,980
Thinking back on our battle so far,

224
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,930
he's able to travel at high
speed within the smoke.

225
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,410
And his ability to sense magic is high.

226
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,540
If we're to land a hit on him,
we'll have to surprise him.

227
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,370
But how do we do that without
him noticing our magic?

228
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,050
The downside of this magic is
that it drains my powers a lot.

229
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,360
My magic level is still fine, though.

230
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,300
Well, that and the fact that
I can't see the enemy.

231
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,600
But that's no problem.

232
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,180
Because I can sense your magic just fine.

233
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,900
Whoa, there!

234
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,530
Wow, a barrage. Are you getting desperate?

235
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,080
That's not going to hit me
or get rid of the smoke.

236
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,710
You're just wasting magic.

237
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,700
I think the difference in our
experience levels is starting to show.

238
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,210
After all, I've fought far
more mages than you have.

239
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,720
Huh?

240
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,150
I chased him over.

241
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,570
And I suppressed my magic so
he wouldn't notice, and then...

242
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,430
Go!

243
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,500
He can't sense Asta, so Asta attacked.

244
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,550
It went well.

245
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,280
I guess teamwork really is important.

246
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,260
H-How can this be?

247
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,730
Begone.

248
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

249
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,570
And push me forward

250
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,610
(I can't find a place to go)

251
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

252
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:05,390
And change the flow of time

253
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,810
(I will keep believing in you)

254
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,690
In this ever-vivid place

255
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,640
(Break free yourself)

256
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

257
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,190
If there is a path that I should choose

258
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

259
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,160
Wherever it may lead us

260
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,650
Until my life comes to an end

261
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

262
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

263
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

264
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

265
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

266
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,270
Petit Clover

267
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,330
Petit Clover!

268
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,770
Family

269
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,040
Family.

270
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,600
Oh, my...

271
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,030
So you decided that you would treat all of
the friends you encountered like family.

272
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,180
That's so wonderful.

273
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,200
Yeah.

274
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,070
Family... So basically, it's like this...

275
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,610
Big Brother Klaus!

276
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,300
That tickles!

277
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,530
Little Brother, allow me
to bestow these upon you.

278
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,260
Yay, glasses!

279
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,260
Thanks, Big Brother!

280
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,820
Not a chance...

281
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,100
He's strong...

282
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:47,230
But if I'm going to become the Wizard King,
I can't be defeated here.

283
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,530
Black Clover, Page 17: "Destroyer."

284
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:55,250
Page 17
Destroyer

285
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,700
Not giving up is my magic.
