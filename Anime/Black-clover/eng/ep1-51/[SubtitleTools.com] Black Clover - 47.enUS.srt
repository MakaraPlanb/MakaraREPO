1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,510
Vetto of the Third Eye, a part
of the organization known as

5
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,390
the Eye of the Midnight Sun that
seeks to destroy the Clover Kingdom,

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,130
infiltrated the Underwater Temple.

7
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,480
His power was so great that Asta and the
others fell to him, one after another.

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,030
Kahono!

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,450
Let her go!

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,990
But Noelle diligently faced off with Vetto

11
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,830
in order to protect her friends!

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,100
I'm Noelle Silva of the Black Bulls!

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,420
How dare you hurt my friends and comrades?!

14
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,580
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

15
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,450
I did it!

16
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,170
It looked as though Noelle's attack
had finally defeated Vetto,

17
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,290
but the battle wasn't over yet!

18
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,130
Impressive... You managed
to draw me out, human.

19
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,970
What's with that eye?

20
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,940
Mythical Beast Magic...

21
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,860
N-No way!

22
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,860
La?

23
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,320
Bah-ha! I'm going to go get help.

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,890
You two tend to as many people as you can.

25
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,890
Bah-ha?

26
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,690
What's this horrifying mana I'm sensing
from the bottom of the sea?

27
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,250
Is it the beast from earlier?

28
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,290
No, this is even worse. It's no beast.

29
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,260
It's a monster that's way
more powerful than a beast!

30
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,770
What is this ominous mana?
I've never felt anything like it before...

31
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,060
Does Lord Vetto's power concern you?

32
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,320
You must be buzzing with confidence,
to look away from me.

33
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,860
Vetto?

34
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,740
That's one of the people
the captain mentioned.

35
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,970
One of the Third Eye, the strongest group
in the Eye of the Midnight Sun...

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,750
He's the one who infiltrated the temple?

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,460
Sucks for you, though.

38
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,340
You'll be exterminated here.

39
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,570
I'm going to suck all the magic out of you.

40
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,510
That's not going to happen.

41
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,770
I'm going to defeat you and find my comrades!

42
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,090
The way he looks...

43
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:39,440
It's almost like one of the fairy tales
Granny used to tell me.

44
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,690
Long ago, there were evil fiends
that lived in this world.

45
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:52,130
They wanted to make this world
and all of its magic their own.

46
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,470
The strongest among them used forbidden magic

47
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,460
to turn himself into a
demon of incredible power

48
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,340
and tried to exterminate humanity.

49
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,420
The one who stood against him
later became the first Wizard King.

50
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,230
This man is just like one of
the fiends from that story.

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,540
Vanish!

52
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,340
Mythical Beast Magic...

53
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,560
Sea Dragon's...

54
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,530
That last spell drained all my magic!

55
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,740
A-Asta!

56
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,200
Kid!

57
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,910
Not yet...

58
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,710
Not yet, damn it!

59
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,090
We haven't given up yet!

60
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,090
Not yet? Yes, not yet!

61
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,770
Now is when I show you true despair!

62
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,640
The Only Weapon

63
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,050
Wh-What are you planning to do?
You can't leave this room.

64
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,050
I can't leave them alone!

65
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,320
Useless, useless, it's useless!

66
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,930
I told you.

67
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:39,320
No one's ever escaped my Spatial Magic:
Different Dimension Sphere.

68
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,110
You bastard! Hurry up and let me
out of here, or you'll be sorry!

69
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,650
Got it?

70
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,020
You hear me?

71
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,780
Answer me, you bastard!

72
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,530
Ooh, well, aren't you scary?

73
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,270
What the hell are you laughing at?

74
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you later!

75
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,730
You bastard! It's too late to apologize now!

76
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,030
Wow...

77
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,880
I'm going to kill you!

78
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,750
Man, this guy is violent.

79
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,370
Mosquito Magic: Mosquito Hum!

80
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,040
Can't you tell? You're trying
to suck blood from a stone!

81
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,590
This sound's going to make me go crazy!

82
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,810
What's the matter? It's like
you've suffered a painful bite.

83
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,600
Mosquito Magic: Mana-Sucker!

84
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,670
Let's see how long you
can keep buzzing around.

85
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,450
We're going to destroy you Magic Knights

86
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,870
so that we, the Eye of the Midnight
Sun, can fulfill our great desire!

87
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,830
Not able to run anymore?

88
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,510
M-My arm won't move?

89
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,220
Is it just your arm that won't move?

90
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,400
Wh-What's going on?

91
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,860
Thanks for moving closer to me.

92
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,530
If you were too far away,

93
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,330
my threads would've been
blown away by the sound waves.

94
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,530
I told you, didn't I? That I was going to
defeat you and go to my comrades.

95
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,290
Wh-Why, you...

96
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,660
Thread Magic: Dancing Doll!

97
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,200
M-My body's bugging out on its own!

98
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,420
Y-You pest!

99
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,920
Suck up as much magic as you want!

100
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,220
But you'll have to settle for your own.

101
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:30,190
M-My magic's... being sucked away...

102
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,950
Goodness. I'm going to replenish
all the mana that was wasted on you.

103
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,210
Now, then...

104
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,750
Wait for me.

105
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,710
I'm surprised you can still stand,
anti-magic brat.

106
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,060
But it's futile.

107
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,970
What can you do when you're so beat up?

108
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,630
My overflowing mana

109
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,980
whispers to me that I should show you
vermin what true despair looks like.

110
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,990
Asta... You're badly hurt. How did you get up?

111
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,810
Kahono... used the last of
her strength to heal me.

112
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,580
Huh?

113
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,150
With a faint song...

114
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,930
Little by little.

115
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,610
Kahono...

116
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,720
Let's pulverize this guy and heal
both Kahono's throat and Kiato's leg.

117
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,520
Huh?

118
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,490
I mean, even he managed to regrow an arm.

119
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,230
I'm sure there's someone out there
who can use magic to heal them!

120
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,830
Oh, yeah, Noelle...

121
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,960
That insane spell you did earlier...
It helped me get back onto my feet.

122
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,720
You're just as awesome as I thought you were!

123
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,290
Leave the rest to me!

124
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,160
Asta!

125
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,330
Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope!

126
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,800
What the hell are you talking about, Asta?!

127
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,350
Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope!

128
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,910
What the hell are you talking about, Asta?!

129
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,730
Leave the rest to you?
Look how beat up you are!

130
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,190
What can you do in that state?

131
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,370
Especially against a monster like that?!

132
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,210
Not to mention...

133
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,130
Allow me to introduce them.

134
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,260
They are the strongest three
in the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

135
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,590
The strongest?

136
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,390
Yes... In combat, they surpass me.

137
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,770
The Third Eye!

138
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,480
They're more powerful than you?

139
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,110
Third Eye, eh?

140
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,940
He has to be bluffing when he says
they're stronger than him.

141
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,240
He wasn't bluffing!

142
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,350
He does have much stronger magic than Licht,

143
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,140
the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

144
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,450
There's no way we could beat this guy,
even if we ganged up on him!

145
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,870
Everyone else is already down for the count...

146
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,210
And he made this giant
hole with no problem!

147
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,870
Okay... I'm going to escape through that hole.

148
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,470
I can't! There's no way I can save them!

149
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,720
I need to at least escape,
or we'll all be wiped out!

150
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,320
Brat, how pathetic you are.

151
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,070
What can you do in that condition?

152
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,280
Shut up! Don't get cocky just
because you got another eye!

153
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,580
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope! That guy's totally right!

154
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,280
Asta, this is impossible!
That guy's magic is insane!

155
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,960
There's no way you can win!

156
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,040
You should hurry up and run!
No, seriously, run away!

157
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,680
You mentioned earlier that one of my
weak points is that I won't give up.

158
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,390
It's not a weakness!

159
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,680
Not giving up is my only weapon!

160
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,190
And I'm never going to give
up until I fulfill my wish!

161
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,170
No matter what!

162
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,770
Not giving up is a weapon?

163
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,580
I will show you just how
useless that weapon is.

164
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,040
I'll show you exactly what despair means!

165
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:09,770
Before I defeat you lot, I should
probably take out the trash first.

166
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,880
You bastard!

167
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,140
Mythical Beast Magic...

168
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,010
Don't!

169
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,250
Oh, dear... Big and hairy over there

170
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,330
must be the insane guy named Vetto
the captain was talking about.

171
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,090
You're way more ugly than I thought you'd be.

172
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,840
Definitely not my type.

173
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,930
Vanessa!

174
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,690
Maybe I should've just passed out drunk.

175
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,440
But you really are insane, little boy.

176
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,760
Still...

177
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,880
You didn't give up, and that's why I'm here.

178
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,450
Go on and pull me along with you!

179
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,660
Thanks!

180
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,110
I was wondering why the other
Black Bulls liked you so much,

181
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,770
and I think I finally get it.

182
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,960
Right, Captain?

183
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,460
That's right, kid.
Just like what Vanessa said.

184
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,970
Because you didn't give up, Noelle,

185
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,550
Gauche,

186
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,720
Magna, and Luck

187
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,230
were all able to go beyond their limits.

188
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,600
And... me, too.

189
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,200
A heart that refuses to
give up is your only weapon?

190
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,230
Rubbish!

191
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,740
Did you really think that these cobwebs

192
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,040
could keep a beast like me tied down?

193
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,690
What fun would it be if you
actually stayed tied down?

194
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,670
Shut your mouth.

195
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:14,790
Do you truly think you can defeat me just
because another insect joined your cause?

196
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,260
Mythical Beast Magic...

197
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,770
I won't make it in time!

198
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,980
So there was still another mouse hiding?

199
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,440
Ugh, honestly...

200
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,030
You guys are so into this.

201
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,240
Finral!

202
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,550
Oh, my.

203
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,910
My juniors are working hard.

204
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,700
That means I have to
act like a proper senior.

205
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,040
Crap! What the heck am I doing?!

206
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,960
I'm gonna die!

207
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,470
I'm impressed you actually showed up.
Good job, Finral the wuss.

208
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,640
O-Of course I showed up!
I'm no wuss, Vanessa!

209
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,140
Don't give up! Don't give up!
Don't give up! Don't give up! Don't give up!

210
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,980
You vermin...

211
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,150
No, you're ants. Less than vermin.
No matter how many of you gather,

212
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,780
you won't even be able to scratch me.

213
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,630
Noelle, you have enough magic
to protect everyone, right?

214
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,740
Y-Yes.

215
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,790
We're counting on you.

216
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:30,090
Still... his magic is unbelievable. Honestly...

217
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,710
Yeah.

218
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,610
But you can't see it, right?

219
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,710
Of course, I can't see it,

220
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,560
but I definitely feel his ki.

221
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,930
If he manages to hit us head-on with any
of his attacks, it'll instantly be over.

222
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,320
It's life or death right off the bat!

223
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,720
It hurts, damn it! I want to cry!

224
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,820
If we get out of this alive,
I'll give you a hug.

225
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,190
A hug?!

226
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,820
You can cry all you want right into my bosom.

227
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,820
For real?!

228
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,830
Finral's ki just blew the hell up!

229
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,490
Controlling guys is child's play.

230
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,330
And for you, ordinary magic attacks
won't work on him at all.

231
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,960
You and your anti-magic will
just have to take care of this.

232
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,340
Make sure you don't let go of
that sword, no matter what.

233
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,340
Got it!

234
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,580
Go give it all you've got.
Put your life on the line.

235
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,310
Yeah, Asta!

236
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,560
I swear that we won't let you die!

237
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,190
Asta... Everyone...

238
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,700
Mythical Beast Magic...

239
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Let's go!

240
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,330
My long-range attacks never
even touch the anti-magic sword.

241
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,810
The spatial magic user just
sends them right back at me.

242
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,070
For a mere human,
he's quite fast and accurate.

243
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,180
Jeez, this is scary!

244
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,070
But I've gotta do this!

245
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,070
In that case...

246
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,820
I'll just have to pick
them off at close range!

247
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,540
You wish!

248
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:44,590
The power of the spatial magic and
your aura are gushing all over the place!

249
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,720
What?

250
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,640
The thread changed his trajectory...

251
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,250
You scuttling little insects!

252
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm going to defeat you...

253
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,510
with this weapon!

254
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:59,270
Petit Clover

255
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,450
Petit Clover!

256
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,770
Service Magic

257
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,180
Service Magic.

258
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,160
What's service magic?

259
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,400
Just like it sounds, it's magic
that's a service to everyone.

260
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,080
Let's give it a shot!

261
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,250
Okay!

262
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,240
All we've had lately is smelly
and hairy guys like Vetto

263
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,790
hogging up all the screen time.

264
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,550
Okay, here we go.

265
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,460
So this is service magic!
I wonder how Mimosa's doing.

266
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,420
Woohoo! That was a total success!

267
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,790
Look at those perfect bodies!

268
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,050
I... I... The Black Bullsâ€”

269
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,810
Wh-What is this?! Stupidsta, you dumbass!

270
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,970
Why me?!

271
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,090
We're going to work
together and defeat Vetto!

272
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,290
Finral and I will assist you, Asta.

273
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,220
You should be able... no,
I know you can do it!

274
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,170
Black Clover, Page 48: "Despair vs. Hope."

275
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:54,250
Page 48
Despair vs. Hope

276
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,700
Not giving up is our magic!
