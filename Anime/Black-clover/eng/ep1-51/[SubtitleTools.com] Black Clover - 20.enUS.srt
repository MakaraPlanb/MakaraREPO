1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,990
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,740
I would always close my eyes

5
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,070
And cower at reality

6
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,770
I can't stand the idea

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,120
Of just making excuses to give up

8
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,300
Stand right there

9
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,400
I don't want to be near you

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,540
Any minute now

11
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,920
Just wait right there

12
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,920
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,010
Black and blue

14
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,930
I'll give up on giving up

15
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,430
And get the world on my side

16
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,090
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive

17
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,320
Every time somewhere under this sky

18
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,180
Break through the tearful nights

19
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,450
And head where the light shines

20
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,290
I want to keep my promise

21
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,830
I'll deliver it to you

22
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,820
shape of love

23
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,570
Assembly at the Royal Capital

24
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,400
What?!

25
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,230
I was asleep for a week?

26
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,010
Honestly, how many days were
you planning on sleeping?

27
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,780
Noelle was so worried about you
that she kept checking on you.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,440
I-I wasn't worried...

29
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,860
I was just wondering what we were
going to do if he didn't wake up.

30
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,460
Pretty sure that's called being worried.

31
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,170
Thanks, Noelle.

32
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,800
I was worried, too. But I'm glad
you all came back safely.

33
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,210
Getting rest is important, too,

34
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,430
because that's how much energy you
used up conquering that dungeon.

35
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,030
But it was a week...

36
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,850
Stop with this nonsense.

37
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,090
Do you think that my goddess,

38
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,240
my sister Marie, would enjoy
listening to all this?

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,170
Talk about something more interesting.

40
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,550
I only have 3,214 stories stocked up for her.

41
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,370
When exactly are you going
to tell her all those?

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,100
How are you feeling? Is the hole
in your stomach closed up yet?

43
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,300
Can you fight me now? Can you?

44
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,760
It's not completely closed up yet.
In fact, my stomach's so empty, I'm starving...

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,340
Everyone! The Sheep Cooks made breakfast!

46
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,770
Yum! So good! Delicious!

47
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,910
Jeez, calm down.

48
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,850
Thanks...

49
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,570
You're such a pig.

50
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,660
Now, now. He needs his nutrients.

51
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,970
Want a taste?

52
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,030
No, he can't!

53
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,570
So good!

54
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,790
Nice, nice! Your eating form is excellent!

55
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,710
The Sheep Cooks are delighted, too.

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,850
I think I'll have some
breakfast and go back to bed.

57
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,510
Captain! Good morning!

58
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,570
Morning.

59
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,970
You finally awake, kid?
I guess you didn't die.

60
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,970
I-I'm alive!

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,460
Good work, even though you
always come back banged up.

62
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,560
Thanks!

63
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,140
Oh, yeah. Apparently, Magic Knights
Headquarters wants a report on the dungeon,

64
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,070
so if you can walk, pay them a visit.

65
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,240
Huh?

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
A report?

67
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,000
The Magic Knights Headquarters?

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,810
La?

69
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,860
Sounds like there'll be
lots of strong guys there!

70
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,620
I wonder if I can fight them.

71
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,460
You'd probably cause trouble if you went,
so you're not going, Luck.

72
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,020
Aw...

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,590
Instead, there's a fighting mission,
so go on that with Magna.

74
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,590
Fighting mission?

75
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,930
Let's do our best, Magna!

76
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,970
Huh? Creepy!

77
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,630
Are you really Luck? Are you sure
you're not Grey in disguise?

78
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,930
Oh, there he is.

79
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,150
Ooh, pick me! I'll go instead!

80
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,870
I wonder what yummy things
await me in the Noble Realm.

81
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,700
Uh, there's no way you can go.
All you do every day is eat.

82
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
La?!

83
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,410
La... La!

84
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,580
Captain, I have to write a
letter to Marie, so I can't go.

85
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,570
Sure. No one asked you, anyway.

86
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,750
Can I go—

87
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,260
Clover Kingdom Royal Capital

88
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,930
This is awesome! It's this huge up close?

89
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,570
Oh, come on.

90
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,790
Could you calm down? You're embarrassing me.

91
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,890
So awesome!

92
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,110
Hey!

93
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,930
I'm alone with Asta.

94
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,870
Wow! It's so huge!

95
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,410
How long must you keep saying that?

96
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,120
This is completely normal.

97
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,120
Oh?

98
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,710
Well, hello! If it isn't the members
of the Golden Dawn!

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,080
Ah, it's been a week, Asta.

100
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,960
Are you here to give a report, as well?

101
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,650
Have your wounds completely healed?

102
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,930
Yeah! My stomach still hurts a little,
but I ate lots and slept lots, so I'm fine!

103
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,900
What are you, a kid?

104
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,310
Who are you calling a kid?!

105
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,250
You.

106
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,220
You're the same age as me!

107
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,820
I'm better because of your
magic, Mimosa. Thanks.

108
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,580
Why'd she run away?

109
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,030
When you raised your hand, your arm was
shorter than expected, and it startled her,

110
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,980
maybe?

111
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,200
What the hell?! Yuno, you jerk!

112
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,200
See?

113
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,700
Damn it!

114
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,700
Unbelievable.

115
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,750
What's wrong, Mimosa?

116
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,540
Mimosa?

117
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,760
I don't know what to do, Noelle.

118
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,850
I, um... Whenever I see Asta,
my chest feels tight.

119
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,560
Ever since that day,
all I can think about is Asta.

120
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,450
What in the world is wrong with me?

121
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,280
What?!

122
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,190
I wonder if he'll hate me
after I ran away like that.

123
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,980
Wh-Why him? He's a peasant,
he's stupid, short, loud...

124
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,700
I find all those things endearing.

125
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,620
And the contrast between that and his body...

126
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,370
Could this be...

127
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,520
No, no, no. That meathead is just...

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,880
Wait. Why do I sound so desperate?

129
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,920
No, no, no!

130
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,130
I don't feel anything for that idiot!

131
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,790
What are they moaning about?

132
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,640
Maybe they have a headache.

133
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,650
I believe headquarters is this way.

134
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,980
I guess there are things even
you don't know, four-eyes.

135
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,900
Indeed, there are.

136
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,550
He's apparently content with
being called "four-eyes" now.

137
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,780
He's much nicer to Asta now.

138
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,790
We don't often get to come to headquarters.

139
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,170
Y-Your Majesty!

140
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,130
I never expected you to welcome us yourself.

141
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,970
Who's that flashy old guy?

142
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,190
You fool! That's the current
Wizard King, Julius Novachrono!

143
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,190
What?!

144
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,720
This guy is the current...

145
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,110
...Wizard King?!

146
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,100
Well done acquiring this.

147
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,220
This magic was probably the most
important relic in that dungeon.

148
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,030
You can read that?

149
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,370
Somewhat.

150
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,570
The most important relic! So cool!

151
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,230
I see...

152
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,920
He's so excited...

153
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,360
I guess the rumors about the Wizard King
being a total magic nerd were true.

154
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,070
Hey, would you try using this magic?

155
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,580
Please?!

156
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,710
I'm sorry. I think it activated
in the dungeon once, but...

157
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,130
I haven't been able to use it since.

158
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,680
What?

159
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,840
I see... Aw, that's too bad.

160
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,220
Sylph, the Wind Spirit of
the Four Great Attributes...

161
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,060
Apparently she's chosen him this era.

162
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,380
All I can say for now

163
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,310
is that this spell will grow with you and,
one day, become an extraordinary power.

164
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,530
Take good care of it.

165
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,400
Yes, sir.

166
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,370
Wizard King! My grimoire has
some weird scribbles in it, too!

167
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,950
Please look at it!

168
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,870
Hey, you're being rude.

169
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,370
This is...

170
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,000
This is?

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,880
Something I can't read at all.

172
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,030
I've never even seen this
writing in any documents.

173
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,720
This thing pops out of it! Take a look!

174
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,720
Ah, a second anti-magic sword!

175
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,270
I got mine to work.

176
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,560
A-Anti-magic... C-Can I touch that?

177
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,320
Go right ahead!

178
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,220
Thank... you?! It's so heavy!

179
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,780
Are you all right, Wizard King?!

180
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm amazed that you can
actually swing this around.

181
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,650
My magical power... is being absorbed.

182
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,830
I see.

183
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,290
Thank you. You can have this back now.

184
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,830
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,210
This is beyond my abilities.

186
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,760
It appears you're able to wield it
because you have no magic.

187
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,020
How did you know I don't have any magic, sir?
And about my sword that cuts through magic?

188
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,440
That's a very good question.

189
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,060
Well, anyway, you all did
splendidly. Good work.

190
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,030
U-U-Um, d-d-do you have a moment?

191
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,530
What is it?

192
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,730
H-How...

193
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,950
...do you become the Wizard King?

194
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,210
I see. So you both want
to become the Wizard King.

195
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,670
Any Magic Knight should have that aspiration.

196
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,180
You two! It's rude to ask
the Wizard King that directly.

197
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,460
Listen. The Wizard King must be proud
and have the trust of the people—

198
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,390
No.

199
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,770
It's merit.

200
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:02,320
You can't protect others with pride,
and the trust of others comes with merit.

201
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,780
There is only one thing people
want from the Wizard King...

202
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,290
Merit that proves they are the best.

203
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,310
Gain merit.

204
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,040
Continuously gaining merit is everything.

205
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,800
Anyone who can't do that
can never stand at the top.

206
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,510
Bring it on!

207
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,290
Your newbies have very determined eyes,

208
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,330
William, Yami.

209
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,020
Now, then...

210
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,320
We're actually holding a decoration
ceremony for the Magic Knights who've been

211
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,490
awarded an outstanding number of stars today.

212
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,070
Deco...?

213
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,440
Decoration ceremony.

214
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,580
It's a ceremony where we award those who
have done exceptionally well and honor them.

215
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,540
Wow...

216
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,290
I would love for all of you to join us.

217
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,770
Huh?

218
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,550
I wonder what decoration ceremonies are like.

219
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,970
I have a bad feeling about this.

220
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,210
I could never have imagined this happening.

221
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,370
Now, then...

222
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,070
Can you give me better results than them?

223
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,760
Now, then... let us begin
the decoration ceremony.

224
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:56,890
Wizard King
Grand Magic Knight
Senior Magic Knight, First~Fifth Class
Intermediate Magic Knight, First~Fifth Class
Junior Magic Knight, First Class
Junior Magic Knight, Second Class
Junior Magic Knight, Third Class
Junior Magic Knight, Fourth Class
Junior Magic Knight, Fifth Class

225
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,400
Magic Knights of the Clover Kingdom are given
ranks to indicate their level of ability.

226
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,890
The ranks are further divided into sub-ranks,
with the Wizard King at the top.

227
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,330
If knights are awarded a prescribed number

228
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,850
of stars in the time before the
annual decoration ceremony,

229
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,530
they are given a new rank by the Wizard King.

230
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,290
With seven stars earned,
Leopold Vermillion of the Crimson Lion Kings,

231
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,890
I grant you the title of
Intermediate Magic Knight, Second Class.

232
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,180
You use the same flame
magic as your older brother,

233
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,300
the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings.
Your power is overwhelming.

234
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,010
Make sure you don't go overboard.

235
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:36,270
Member of the Crimson Lion Kings
Leopold Vermillion

236
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,270
Evil needs no mercy.

237
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,020
With six stars earned, Sol Marron
of the Blue Rose Knights,

238
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,730
I grant you the title of
Intermediate Magic Knight, Third Class.

239
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,740
You're as dynamic as the men,
and your creative earth magic is amazing.

240
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,970
But you might be a bit
too much of a free spirit.

241
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,290
Member of the Blue Rose Knights
Sol Marron

242
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,290
The only one who can tie me down is my sis,

243
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,870
the captain.

244
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,380
With six stars earned,
Solid Silva of the Silver Eagles,

245
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,410
I grant you the title of
Intermediate Magic Knight, Third Class.

246
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,200
The maneuverability of
your magic is amazing,

247
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,910
Member of the Silver Eagles
Solid Silva

248
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,170
but I think you'd be even more amazing

249
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,210
if you stopped showing off your powers
and cooperated with others.

250
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,100
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

251
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,650
With nine stars earned,
Nebra Silva of the Silver Eagles,

252
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,590
I grant you the title of
Senior Magic Knight, Fifth Class.

253
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,960
The skillful illusions you create
with your mist magic are splendid.

254
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,680
Member of the Silver Eagles
Nebra Silva

255
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,560
Just make sure you don't play with
the enemy more than necessary,

256
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,820
or you might get bitten.

257
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,540
I thank you for the warning.

258
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,050
With seven stars earned,
Hamon Caseus of the Golden Dawn,

259
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,790
I grant you the title of
Intermediate Magic Knight, Second Class.

260
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,050
Just by looking at you, the enemy
would never expect your glass magic,

261
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,080
Member of the Golden Dawn
Hamon Caseus

262
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,460
and I bet they're completely boggled.

263
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,450
I thank you, Your Majesty.

264
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,770
With eight stars earned,
Shiren Tium of the Golden Dawn,

265
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,750
I grant you the title of
Intermediate Magic Knight, First Class.

266
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,860
Unlike your eloquent magic,
you're a very quiet fellow,

267
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:21,830
Member of the Golden Dawn
Shiren Tium

268
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,940
so you'd be better off if
you spoke your mind more.

269
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,830
Understood.

270
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,840
With eleven stars earned,
Alecdora Sandler of the Golden Dawn,

271
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,530
I grant you the title of
Senior Magic Knight, Second Class.

272
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,560
You amaze me with your
diligence and flexible magic.

273
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:42,310
Member of the Golden Dawn
Alecdora Sandler

274
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,240
You can probably relax a
little more once in a while.

275
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,810
I am honored, Your Majesty.

276
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,490
The Golden Dawn has earned
a total of 71 stars.

277
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,860
They are the clear leaders.

278
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,580
I hope the rest of the squads do
their best to not fall behind.

279
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,920
Well done, all of you.

280
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,700
Now then, there's a simple reception
set up for you, so go enjoy yourselves.

281
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,050
Oh, I almost forgot.

282
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,870
I've invited some special guests today.

283
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,550
Make sure you get to know
each other very well.

284
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,270
Wizard King,

285
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,460
regarding that matter...

286
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,140
Something came up, so I have to
excuse myself, but have fun!

287
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,890
Huh?

288
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,360
All those stares are beginning to hurt.

289
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,010
How are we supposed to enjoy this?

290
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,410
Why is the Wizard King
entertaining us like this?

291
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,220
Not to mention the Wizard
King went off somewhere...

292
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,270
The heck is this?!

293
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,540
I've never eaten anything like this!

294
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,500
So good!

295
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,190
How can you be so bold? You're amazing, Asta.

296
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,760
No, he's just unrefined.

297
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,440
So good!

298
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,210
U-Um, Asta...

299
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,180
May I join you?

300
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,150
Oh, Mimosa, were you eyeing this meat, too?

301
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,070
Huh? Oh... Yes, it looks quite delicious.

302
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,430
Vulgar peasant.

303
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,740
Why did the Wizard King
invite such lowborn scum?

304
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,550
I can't sense any magic from him.

305
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:24,120
Them capturing the dungeon
must've been sheer luck.

306
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,810
The way he eats is disgusting.

307
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,130
It's unnatural for him to be here. Filthy rat.

308
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,770
Man, listen to them tear into me.
Good thing I'm used to it.

309
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,580
H-He's so forgiving!

310
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,770
You also have a peasant in your squad.

311
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,690
The peasant who's forgotten his place
since everyone fawns over him

312
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,100
because of the four-leaf grimoire he has.

313
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,780
I could've handled capturing
that dungeon even better.

314
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,240
That's quite confident, crimson brat.

315
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,080
It's not like we expect
anything from that peasant.

316
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:17,170
We are the ones who embody Lord Vangeance
and the Golden Dawn's ideals.

317
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,150
W-With all due respect...

318
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,620
That goes for you as well, Klaus.

319
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,670
Aren't you ashamed, being here
with your lack of skill?

320
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,810
I...

321
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,930
And Mimosa!

322
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,190
I heard that you were wounded early on
in the dungeon and left the front line.

323
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,480
To think that you're royalty of
the Vermillion line is laughable.

324
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,820
I-I'm terribly sorry.

325
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,780
N-No, Mimosa was...

326
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,000
Now, now. The most useless fool here...

327
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,630
is you.

328
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,210
Wouldn't you agree, Noelle?

329
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,510
Solid...

330
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,140
H-How could you?

331
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:12,810
You can't even control your magic.
You're such an embarrassment.

332
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,620
You've basically been exiled
from the Silva family.

333
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,360
I'm surprised you had the nerve
to return to the Noble Realm.

334
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,950
Nebra...

335
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,700
You got a big head from one achievement.

336
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,860
Did you come here intending to bring
shame upon the Silva name?

337
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,870
N-Nozel...

338
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,380
You do not belong here.

339
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Begone,

340
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,880
failure that killed our mother.

341
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,230
There's no reason to run from these jerks.

342
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,410
Asta?

343
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,450
I thought you'd all be amazing
since you were called here,

344
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,700
but you're no different from the rest of them!

345
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,290
Calling us peasants, rats,
embarrassments, failures...

346
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,540
Who cares if you think we're worthy or not?!

347
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,300
Just you watch! I'm going to—

348
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,420
That's enough, you scoundrel.

349
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,150
You shouldn't even be allowed to talk!

350
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,220
Silence!

351
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,520
I won't shut up!

352
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,830
He just...

353
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,310
Listen up, you bastards!

354
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,310
I'm going to pile up merit,

355
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,570
become the Wizard King,

356
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,330
and shut you all up!

357
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,600
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day

358
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,570
And push me forward

359
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,640
(I can't find a place to go)

360
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,890
Even the faintest light can
still break through the darkness

361
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:27,390
And change the flow of time

362
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,810
(I will keep believing in you)

363
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,690
In this ever-vivid place

364
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,660
(Break free yourself)

365
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,530
In order to grasp my endless dream

366
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,190
If there is a path that I should choose

367
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,250
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)

368
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,160
Wherever it may lead us

369
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,650
Until my life comes to an end

370
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,330
I will accept any pain that comes my way

371
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,350
(We can try again, we can try again)

372
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,710
Even if we can't see tomorrow

373
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,260
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice

374
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,990
I'll keep screaming them in my heart

375
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,290
Petit Clover

376
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,710
Petit Clover!

377
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,800
My Magic

378
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,270
My Magic.

379
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,150
I'll show you my magic. It's hex magic.

380
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,450
In the next ten minutes...

381
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,800
you'll blink.

382
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,700
Let's Gordon!

383
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,810
Hey, Asta!

384
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,650
You're being rude to the senior
members of the Magic Knights!

385
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,420
Apologize, right now!

386
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,020
I'll even apologize with you!

387
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,050
Black Clover, Page 21:
"Capital Riot."

388
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,000
Page 21
Capital Riot

389
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,700
Making my glasses sparkle is my magic!
