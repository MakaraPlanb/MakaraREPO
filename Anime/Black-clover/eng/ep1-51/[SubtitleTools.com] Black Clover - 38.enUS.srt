1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,650
It appeared as though humanity
would be destroyed by the demons.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,160
But a single mage saved them all.

3
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,460
He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.

4
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,230
It's so pretty.

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,580
Where am I?

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,330
It can't be... Is this heaven?!

7
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,640
I refuse to die, damn it!

8
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,150
I'm so sorry!

9
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,500
Asta...

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,610
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,780
There's not a chance you'd actually die.

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,160
Yuno! Noelle and Mimosa...

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,030
And Mr. Glasses!

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,770
I was worried about you.

15
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:08,020
Thank goodness! I don't know what
I'd do if you hadn't woken up!

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,590
How long are you going to
hold on to each other?!

17
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,710
I'm injured here!

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,890
Hmph!

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,780
The Magic Knights Captain Conference

20
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,360
What?! I was asleep for a whole day?!

21
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,270
Yes. You were even snoring.

22
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,580
Must've been a nice nap.

23
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,530
That just means he was able to use
all of his strength to fight.

24
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,650
We wanted to fight with you,
but by the time we got there,

25
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,690
the Eye of the Midnight Sun had escaped.

26
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,120
You guys contacted us too late.

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,290
That's why we were caring for you after
you were brought to the church, Asta.

28
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,420
Thanks for the recovery magic, Mimosa.

29
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,850
Oh, it's nothing at all, really.

30
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,970
The one who worked the hardest to
make sure you were okay is Klaus.

31
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,640
A-Ahem...

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,340
More importantly,
thanks to you and the others,

33
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,770
it appears that all of the
kidnapped children are safe.

34
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,000
Also, regarding the perpetrator Neige,

35
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,780
they're interrogating him
back at headquarters.

36
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,480
I'm assuming he knows nothing
about the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

37
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,340
They're taking into consideration

38
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,690
his deep regret and the fact
that he meant no harm.

39
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,690
I think he's going to be
doing volunteer work

40
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,730
here at this church to pay for his crimes.

41
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,490
I see. That's perfect for him!

42
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,730
Anyway, it sounds like you
did a great job again—

43
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,960
If I were there, I wouldn't have let
the Eye of the Midnight Sun escape.

44
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,510
I'll get them for sure next time!

45
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,360
Yuno! I'm never going to lose to you!

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm still going to keep getting
stronger and stronger!

47
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,790
And I'll continue to get
even stronger than you.

48
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,010
Then I'm going to keep trying
more, more, and even more!

49
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,230
And then one day...

50
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,980
...I'll become the Wizard King!

51
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,190
Oh, you two get along so well!

52
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,990
Huh?

53
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,830
Not a chance.

54
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,340
We should probably take our leave.

55
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,220
Yes.

56
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,430
Oh, yes!

57
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,440
Sister Theresa also just
woke up not too long ago.

58
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,240
Huh?

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,250
Gauche should be with her right now.

60
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,880
Hey, I came to see you, old hag
who doesn't know when to die.

61
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,660
Is that how you talk to an injured person?

62
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,210
Get the hell out, you sister complex punk.

63
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,390
What? Should I just finish you off,
since you don't know when to die?

64
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,150
Go ahead and try. Then you'll
go right back to the slammer,

65
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,820
you sister complex punk
with a criminal record.

66
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,650
Don't fight with her, Brother!

67
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,620
Well, if that's what you want, Marie.

68
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:12,410
And... I guess I'm at least grateful that
you took care of Marie, you stupid old hag.

69
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,010
Hmph. I guess you've grown,
if you can actually thank people.

70
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,500
Also...

71
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,510
I'm glad you're alive.

72
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,970
I see.

73
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,600
Now, my beloved angel Marie,
praise your big brother for not arguing!

74
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,230
Pardon me!

75
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,610
It's Asta!

76
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,290
Yay!

77
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,000
I was worried about you!

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,490
I won't die!

79
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,110
I'm going to kill you after all.

80
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,790
He's still got a long way to go.

81
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,670
How are you feeling, Granny?

82
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,670
Who do you think I am?

83
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,800
More importantly,
when I tell your Sister Lily

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,450
about all of your heroic deeds
this time, I'm sure she'll be pleased.

85
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,180
True!

86
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,560
Sister Lily! Soon I'll become the
Wizard King and come for you!

87
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,280
Asta, we have to head back soon.

88
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,940
Wait, there's one place
we have to visit first.

89
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,480
It's so good!

90
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,850
This is so frickin' good!

91
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,600
R-Really? I was cooking so you'd have
plenty to eat when you woke up,

92
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,200
but I guess I made a little too much.

93
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,330
What is this? This is really good.

94
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,330
So good!

95
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,960
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.

96
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,490
Oh, come on, Brother!

97
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,690
I'm not done eating yet!

98
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,960
I'll kill him... I'll kill him... I'll kill him...

99
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,530
I wonder if guys prefer girls
who can cook, after all.

100
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,800
Asta! Thanks for lending me your robe!

101
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,680
Sure. Looks like you kept it clean,
just like you promised.

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,890
Yup!

103
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,570
Your robe may be fine, but look
how beaten up you got!

104
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,470
It looks like you're hopeless without me.

105
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,550
I'm pretty sure I get beat up
even when you're around, Noelle.

106
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,240
Someone he can fight alongside, huh?

107
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,550
Oh, shut up, Stupidsta!

108
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,840
I know I can't use recovery
magic like Mimosa!

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,870
True.

110
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,740
Asta...

111
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,370
Sorry, but I'm getting the first kiss.

112
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,830
Thank you for saving Luca and Marco, Asta!

113
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,090
Huh? Huh?

114
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,560
Y-Yeah! You're welcome!

115
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,830
H-H-Hey... Wh-Wh-What?!

116
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,130
Shrimpsta! Did you burn off your lunch?!

117
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,010
Yes, sir!

118
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,480
All right! We're gonna have a traditional
Black Bulls eating contest

119
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,370
to commemorate your full recovery!

120
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,200
This time, we're having tato pies!

121
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,140
Thanks!

122
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,010
I'm starving!

123
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,600
Have we done something like this before?

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,610
Nope!

125
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,520
More importantly, you should fight me!

126
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,920
I wish I could've fought the Third Eye!

127
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,570
Marie, we've already been apart half a day...

128
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,950
I want to give Asta a surprise party, too.

129
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,350
Yeah, I'm going to pass.

130
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,060
If I ate this much, I'd just get
a stomachache and end up in bed.

131
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,360
I'm also going to pass. What are you
trying to make a royal like me do?

132
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,320
Shut yer traps!

133
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,760
All of you are participating,
whether you like it or not.

134
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,820
All right, Mr. Yami! Please do
us the honor of being the judge!

135
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,570
All right, if you're all
done complaining now...

136
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,410
Ready... go!

137
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,120
So good!

138
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,370
It's instantly dehydrating me...

139
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,970
Hey, I haven't even eaten,
but I'm already full!

140
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,700
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

141
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,700
Finral, you bastard.

142
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,710
Stop using your spatial magic to
dump all this into Luck's stomach.

143
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,830
You caught me.

144
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,920
Aw, but I can't eat these if I don't
have some pretty lady feeding me.

145
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,960
You're out.

146
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,950
Flame Magic: Explosive Reheating!

147
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,370
I thought they'd taste better if I baked
them a little more, but I overcooked them.

148
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,170
You're out.

149
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,520
I've still got plenty of room for seconds!

150
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,920
Hi.

151
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,830
Gordon?! What are you doing there?!

152
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,930
You can keep eating. Here, say, "Ah."

153
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,930
You're being creepy, so you're out.

154
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,340
I'd rather devour Marie than
do something this stupid.

155
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,880
You're both out since you
haven't eaten a damn thing!

156
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,270
Hydration... Hydration...

157
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,210
They were both done a long time ago.

158
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,530
The only ones left are...

159
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,060
Asta and Charmy are head-to-head!

160
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:14,690
All right! I'll show you I can
win this without using magic!

161
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,050
Results

162
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,050
As for the results,

163
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,570
Victor:
Charmy Pappitson

164
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,030
Charmy won without using magic.

165
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,200
You've still got a lot to learn, kid.

166
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,400
My identity!

167
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,270
No one's surprised.

168
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,530
That crest...

169
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,700
That's a letter from the
royal capital, isn't it?

170
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,880
Is there an incident?
Do we need to take action?!

171
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,630
Shut up and rest.

172
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,420
Or so I'd like to say... but it looks
like the Wizard King wants to see you.

173
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,120
The Wizard King?!

174
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,180
The other captains and I have a conference
tomorrow, so he says to bring you along.

175
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,750
I wonder what he wants!

176
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,550
Like I know.

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,380
You'll find out when you get there.

178
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,970
Wizard King,

179
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,720
I have sent a message to all of

180
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,300
the Magic Knights Captains
regarding tomorrow's conference.

181
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,730
Thanks, Marx.

182
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,180
I don't want to believe it,

183
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,970
but it's clear that there's
a traitor among us

184
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,740
who's connected to the
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

185
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,950
And I'll find out who it is tomorrow.

186
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,830
But...

187
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,240
Are you sure this is going to work?

188
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,790
It'll all depend on Asta.

189
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,170
We've been waiting for you,

190
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,170
Captain of the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro, and

191
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,870
Asta.

192
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,640
Um... Who are you again?

193
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,400
I guess this is the first time we've
really spoken to one another.

194
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,270
I'm...

195
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,570
Mushroom Head.

196
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,040
Yes, Mushroom Head.

197
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,150
Hey! Please don't be so rude!

198
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,700
Wizard King's Advisor
Marx Francois

199
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,700
My name is Marx. I'm the Wizard King's advisor.

200
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,240
The Wizard King's?!
You're awesome, Mushroom Head!

201
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,570
Well, it's definitely a lot of work.

202
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,840
Also, my name's Marx, not Mushroom Head.

203
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,920
So, where's the conference
being held, Mushroom Head?

204
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,760
It's M-a-r-x!

205
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,800
It'll take a bit more time to finish
preparing for the conference,

206
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,140
so please wait with the other captains.

207
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,460
Would you come with me, Asta?

208
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,980
I heard you fought splendidly
the other day, Asta.

209
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,520
I'm sure you'll receive at least another
ten stars from the Wizard King.

210
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,400
Seriously?! All right!

211
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,660
Wait... Where are we?

212
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,840
We're headed to an underground prison that
very few in the royal capital know of.

213
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,870
We keep important prisoners down here.

214
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,580
Important prisoners?

215
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,640
You know that we've captured members of the

216
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,480
Eye of the Midnight Sun who were involved
in the attack against the capital, right?

217
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,460
Then the ones in the underground prison...

218
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,290
Yes. They have a spell on them
that protects their memories,

219
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,600
so we haven't been able to get any info
about the Eye of the Midnight Sun yet.

220
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,620
But the Wizard King thought
that your anti-magic sword

221
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,600
could possibly undo the protection.

222
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:23,190
When they attacked the capital,
they were always one step ahead of us.

223
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,820
That would've been impossible unless
they had help from the inside.

224
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,780
We're pretty certain there's
a traitor among us,

225
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,210
and it's someone rather high up.

226
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,830
On the level of a Magic Knights Captain.

227
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,380
N-No way!

228
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,110
We'd rather not believe that, either.
That's why we want to clear things up.

229
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,160
We're here.

230
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,430
Right...

231
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,770
Hello?

232
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,440
Hey, Asta. Great work again.

233
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,650
Th-The Wizard King! It's great to see you!

234
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,280
Sorry to bring you here
when you're probably tired,

235
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,050
but you're the only one who
can use the anti-magic sword.

236
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,050
By the way, I heard you fought with the
higher-ups of the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

237
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,770
What kinds of magic did they use?

238
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,250
Wh-What kinds?

239
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,600
Say what?! Copy magic?

240
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,280
They can copy other people's magic?

241
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,250
That's amazing!

242
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,010
Beast magic?! I've never
heard of that before!

243
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,810
What?! Spirit magic?!

244
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,670
Fire? So, the Salamander?!

245
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,220
I would've loved to see all of that!

246
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,080
Um...

247
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,000
Wizard King!

248
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,670
Oh, sorry about that.

249
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,510
All right, Asta. Could you give it a try?

250
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,910
Do you think you can do it?

251
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,210
I believe so! As you wish, Wizard King!

252
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,940
What's the deal with that brat?

253
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,780
This isn't good.

254
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,950
That's the brat who uses anti-magic.

255
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,940
He's planning on breaking the protection
spell that's on our memories.

256
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,170
Don't... Don't touch me, you stupid brat!

257
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,880
Hi-yah!

258
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,500
Now, Marx.

259
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,340
Yes, sir.

260
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,130
Memory Exchange Magic: Mémoire Absolue!

261
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,930
Wh-What is this?

262
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,490
I've made a connection
directly into their heads,

263
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,480
and this spell allows me to get answers
from their true memories.

264
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,420
Now they won't be able
to hide anything anymore.

265
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,850
That's so cool...

266
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,220
I know, right?! It's such an awesome spell!

267
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,100
Isn't it cool?!

268
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,110
Yeah!

269
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,500
Silence! I need quiet, please!

270
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,640
Yes, sir...

271
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,920
I will ask you both a number of questions.

272
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,710
Answer me honestly.

273
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,470
Understood?

274
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,330
Yes.

275
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,820
Captain of the Purple Orcas
Gueldre Poizot

276
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,820
I heard about your work at Nean.

277
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,540
To think that four Magic Knights Captains
would actually let the terrorists escape.

278
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,740
Captain of the Green Praying Mantises
Jack the Ripper

279
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,770
They're nothing like the weaklings
you guys were dealing with

280
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,980
from the Diamond Kingdom
and the Spade Kingdom!

281
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,830
Says the captain of a squad
with fewer stars than mine.

282
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,440
You sure you're not doing anything
underhanded to get those stars?

283
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,520
Captain of the Black Bulls
Yami Sukehiro

284
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,630
Man, the gleam on a new
katana is something else.

285
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,090
Sucks that I'll be making payments
on it for ten years, though.

286
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,530
Anyway, calm down, Original
Scrawny Line-Face Guy.

287
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,250
What Garbledre is saying is the truth.

288
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,410
It's Gueldre.

289
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,260
You're the last person I want
to hear that from, No-Stars Yami.

290
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,280
Captain of the Coral Peacocks
Dorothy Unsworth

291
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,280
Whatever. I've got plenty of black stars.

292
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,020
Those are negative stars!
Why are you proud of that?

293
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,040
Captain of the Silver Eagles
Nozel Silva

294
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,460
Silence, you foreigner and former peasant.

295
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,590
You're annoying.

296
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,580
What was that, Mister Royalty?
Do you want to join in?

297
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,260
Captain of the Blue Rose Knights
Charlotte Roselei

298
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,310
How stupid. We're getting nowhere
because of you noisy men.

299
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,070
Why am I next to Yami?!

300
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,700
Calm down, Charlotte. Stay calm... Calm...

301
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,770
Captain of the Aqua Deer
Rill Boismortier

302
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,090
I guess they haven't decided on a temporary
captain for the Crimson Lion Kings yet.

303
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:13,510
If Fuegoleon was here, he'd pull
things together really well, but...

304
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,640
Did the air just get really heavy?!

305
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,720
I'm the youngest, so I
need to lighten the mood!

306
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,520
Look!

307
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,790
This is my Fuegoleon impression!

308
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,280
What do you think you're doing?

309
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,580
Don't let the fact that you're the
youngest captain ever go to your head.

310
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,490
Huh?!

311
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,930
You're a funny guy!

312
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,370
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

313
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,410
Captain of the Golden Dawn
William Vangeance

314
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,410
I apologize for being late.

315
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,830
What were you doing, Vangeance?

316
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,210
Oh, there was some business
I couldn't get out of.

317
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,600
I expect you're busy.

318
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,430
You are the charismatic captain of the squad
with the most stars this term, after all.

319
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,970
I'd love to know your secret.

320
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,930
How did you claw your way up to become
the strongest squad so very fast?

321
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,530
I hear those who join your squad will
develop powers beyond all expectations.

322
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,550
Do you have magic that
can see people's futures?

323
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,090
I have no power that impressive.

324
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,070
My knights work hard, that's all.

325
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,770
Really, I'd like to ask you, a wealthy merchant,
the trick to making so much money.

326
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,010
That's a company secret.

327
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,930
I've been thinking this for a while,
but the way you laugh is creepy.

328
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,970
Why would you bring that up now?

329
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,190
Also, you resemble a boneless ham.

330
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,060
Vangeance...

331
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,100
Where were you during the
distinguished service ceremony?

332
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,570
It's customary for a captain
to accompany members

333
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,630
of his squad when they attend the ceremony.

334
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,320
Business you couldn't get out of again?

335
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,560
I was out gambling. I lost all my money.

336
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,680
Sorry.

337
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,330
No one asked you.

338
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,610
The air got heavy again!

339
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,870
This time, I'll do it right!

340
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:17,780
And you, if you're attempting to do an
impression of me, you'd better be prepared.

341
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,670
You're right!

342
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,410
It's not easy to do that braid over your face!

343
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,510
Man, you're hilarious.

344
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,930
Come on, don't pick on Goldy.

345
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,730
I mean, you don't use light magic, do you?

346
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,690
Indeed.

347
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,370
And there it goes again!

348
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,330
Look, everyone!

349
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,990
This is my Yami impression!

350
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,320
Keep your mouth shut, Fluffy!

351
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,390
Huh?!

352
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,070
You must've been really
spoiled growing up, rich kid.

353
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,470
Well, don't expect the same
treatment from me, loser.

354
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,510
He was laughing before, but suddenly snapped?!

355
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,090
And you! Quit sleeping!

356
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,930
Oh, can you talk in snores?

357
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,390
I have no idea what you're saying, though!

358
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,150
Not to mention, Julius was the one who
called us all here, so where is he?!

359
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:20,500
That old guy better not have forgotten
us and wandered off somewhere!

360
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,440
That's very possible.

361
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,160
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

362
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,440
Everything is ready,

363
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,410
so if you'd hold the
conference in another room—

364
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,250
Huh?!

365
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,410
You come here!

366
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,170
Huh?! He's snapped?!

367
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,750
Hey, kid. Working hard?

368
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,550
Y-Yes, sir. Great work, sir.

369
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,120
Does he need to take a dump or something?

370
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,530
What did you need, Wizard King?

371
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,650
Those two are from the
Eye of the Midnight Sun...

372
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,180
Did you learn something from them?

373
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,490
Yes. Several things, thanks to Marx and Asta.

374
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,200
I suppose this is the biggest one.

375
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,700
I've learned that there
is a traitor among you

376
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,790
who is working with the
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

377
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,350
Petit Clover

378
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,410
Petit Clover!

379
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,850
Memory Exchange Magic!!

380
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,810
Memory Exchange Magic.

381
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,890
Mémoire Absolue!

382
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,390
I will ask you a series of questions.
Answer me honestly.

383
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,440
Okay.

384
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,170
If you were asked to choose
between being the Wizard King

385
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,810
and your obsession with magic...

386
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,660
Obsession with magic.

387
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,690
I knew it!

388
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,300
I-In that case...

389
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,460
What do you think about me?

390
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,830
You can be a bit naggy, but you're
a hard worker. I'm always grateful.

391
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,570
I see...

392
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,290
Because of that, I can concentrate
more on my obsession with magic,

393
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,800
rather than being the Wizard King.

394
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,230
What?!

395
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,730
There's a traitor in this dungeon?

396
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,020
The Magic Knights are

397
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,230
supposed to be people everyone
in the Clover Kingdom can look up to!

398
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,980
I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

399
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,450
Black Clover, Page 39: "Three-Leaf Salute."

400
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,250
Page 39
Three-Leaf Salute

401
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,740
I won't forgive the traitor!
