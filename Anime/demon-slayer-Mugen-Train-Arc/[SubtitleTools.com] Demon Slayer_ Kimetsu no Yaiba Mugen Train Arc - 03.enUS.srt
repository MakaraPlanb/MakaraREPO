1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
MUGEN

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,690
To be able to die while dreaming...

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,230
Just how lucky are you?

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,740
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,910
A human's driving force
is the heart, the spirit!

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,330
DREAM

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,420
All you have to do
is destroy the spiritual core.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,130
You can kill them just like that!

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,090
All human hearts are the same.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,300
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,560
You are falling...

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,060
You are falling...

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,270
into a dream.

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,200
It's a deep slumber.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,450
They can...

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,200
LOWER ONE

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,740
no longer awaken.

18
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,220
EPISODE 3:
SHOULD HAVE BEEN

19
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,450
This way!

20
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,580
The peaches over here taste great!

21
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,000
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
I'll make you a chaplet!

23
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,500
I can make these really great-looking ones...

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,170
Nezuko!

25
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,840
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

26
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,220
Zenitsu?

27
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,520
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

28
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,770
River?

29
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,020
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

30
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,780
I can't swim.

31
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,780
I-I'll just carry you on my back
and jump right over the river!

32
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,790
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,290
Just leave it to me!

34
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,790
Let's go!

35
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,890
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

36
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,770
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

37
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,610
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

38
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,150
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

39
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,030
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

40
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,820
Boss!

41
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,070
Boss!

42
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,820
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

43
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,490
PONJIRO

44
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,490
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

45
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,000
CHUITSU

46
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,000
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

47
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,500
Here he is!

48
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,090
All right, let's go! Showdown!

49
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,970
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

50
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,550
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!

51
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,810
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

52
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,890
Let's go!

53
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,150
- Hey!
- Hey!

54
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,590
Why did I come here?

55
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,220
Oh, right.

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,730
To report to my father...

57
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,600
that I've become a Hashira.

58
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,330
So what if you've become a Hashira?

59
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,130
Worthless.

60
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,800
It means nothing.

61
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,800
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

62
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,100
Neither you...

63
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,310
nor I.

64
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,730
Brother...

65
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,780
Was our father pleased to hear your news?

66
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:34,030
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,250
He wasn't always like that.

68
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,670
After all, he did rise to the rank of Hashira
in the Demon Slayer Corps.

69
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,550
He was a passionate man.

70
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,890
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

71
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,260
Suddenly.

72
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,730
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

73
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,770
Why?

74
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,740
It's pointless to think
about such things, so stop.

75
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,990
Senjuro is even worse off.

76
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,830
He barely has any memories of our mother
who died of illness when he was very young,

77
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,250
and just look at the state our father is in.

78
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,840
I'm going to be honest.

79
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,380
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

80
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,970
He told me that it meant nothing.

81
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,310
But that's not enough
to extinguish my passion!

82
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,480
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

83
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,480
I'll never give in!

84
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,480
And Senjuro...

85
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,240
You're not like me.

86
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,700
You have a big brother...

87
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,740
who believes in his little brother.

88
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,580
No matter what path you take,
you're going to become a fine human being!

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

90
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,340
Let's do our best!

91
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,550
Let's do our best and live on!

92
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,880
No matter how lonely it gets.

93
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,430
Looking good.

94
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,890
Those ropes that I created are used

95
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,310
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

96
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,650
I always fight with the utmost caution.

97
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:37,120
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

98
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,370
I'll enjoy the feast
after killing the Demon Slayers.

99
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,920
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

100
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,180
Relax your shoulders.

101
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,720
Like this?

102
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,010
That's right.

103
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,930
Close call. He's right there.

104
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,980
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

105
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,570
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

106
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,480
Hurry!

107
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,700
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

108
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,870
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

109
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,160
DREAM

110
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:30,790
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside
the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

111
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,670
SUBCONSCIOUS

112
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,380
CORE

113
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,220
That's what you must destroy.

114
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,470
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

115
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,980
There it is!

116
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,480
The scenery doesn't end here,
but I can't go any further.

117
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,820
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

118
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,620
And then, I'll get to see
a happy dream myself!

119
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,720
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

120
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,430
It's hot.

121
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,970
It's burning up.

122
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,260
I have to hurry.

123
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,160
Found it!

124
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,870
The spiritual core!

125
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,330
I've never seen a red one before.

126
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,380
All I have to do is destroy this and...

127
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,170
it'll be my turn to...

128
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,120
I thought humans couldn't move
while they were under a spell.

129
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,960
What a strong survival instinct he has!

130
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,380
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

131
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,050
Wow!

132
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,430
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

133
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,930
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

134
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,650
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

135
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,110
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

136
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,070
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

137
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,070
Can you get the grill ready for me?

138
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,610
Okay!

139
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,950
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

140
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,580
Okay, I'll be in charge
of flipping them over, then!

141
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,410
Me, too!

142
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,750
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

143
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,420
No fair!

144
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,180
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
MUGEN TRAIN ARC

145
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,180
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
MUGEN TRAIN ARC

146
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,860
There.

147
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,070
Nezuko, let's go.

148
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,540
What did I just say?

149
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,590
I'm back!

150
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,210
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

151
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,380
Yeah, I'm home!

152
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,010
Welcome home, Big Bro!

153
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,390
Welcome home!

154
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,100
Welcome!

155
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,190
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

156
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,860
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

157
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,280
In broad daylight?

158
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,200
She's not supposed to?

159
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,620
Well...

160
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,070
Um...

161
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,280
Tanjiro...

162
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,700
Could you get the bath ready?

163
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,210
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

164
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,750
I keep saying all these strange things.

165
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
Am I tired maybe?

166
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,640
Huh? It's gone.

167
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,480
I wonder what that was
for just a split second.

168
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,560
A toolbox perhaps?

169
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,190
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

170
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,910
Wake up!

171
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,410
Wake up!

172
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,500
Wake up!

173
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,330
You're under attack!

174
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,590
It's a dream!

175
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,090
This is a dream!

176
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,260
Wake up now!

177
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,590
I see... That's right, I'm...

178
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,760
on board the train!

179
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,600
Wake up and fight!

180
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,100
Fight!

181
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,980
Fight!

182
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,530
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

183
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,110
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

184
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Why are you always
taking food away from Big Bro?

185
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,120
What's your problem?

186
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,950
You just had seconds!

187
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,210
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

188
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,540
How can I get out of it?

189
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,710
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

190
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,720
What am I supposed to do?

191
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,280
I have to wake up...

192
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,480
Big Bro!

193
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,610
- What should we do? The fire is—
- Big Bro!

194
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,200
That's Nezuko's scent!

195
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,950
It's Nezuko's blood!

196
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,450
Nezuko...

197
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,700
Nezuko!

198
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,920
My uniform...

199
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,290
My Nichirin Sword...

200
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,260
I'm waking up!

201
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,920
Little by little.

202
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,550
Little by little!

203
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,430
Big Bro?

204
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,600
Big Bro, are you all right?

205
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,810
Big Bro?

206
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,850
Sorry.

207
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,560
I have to go.

208
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
I have to hurry back!

209
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,400
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,820
Big Bro!

211
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,570
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

212
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,790
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

213
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,750
I have to find him
and slash him right away!

214
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,800
Where is he? I have to...

215
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,340
Where are you going, Big Bro?

216
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,230
I picked lots of vegetables today!

217
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,400
Mom! This way!

218
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,400
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

219
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,740
Mom?

220
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,500
Tanjiro, are you all right?

221
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,870
Big Bro...

222
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,420
What's the matter, Tanjiro?
Why are you dressed like that?

223
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,480
I wish I could stay here...

224
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,270
forever.

225
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,860
I wish I could turn around and go back.

226
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,280
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

227
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,240
Right here.

228
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,330
If none of this had happened...

229
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,630
they'd all have been alive and well now.

230
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,840
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

231
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,260
If none of this had happened...

232
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,100
If none of this had happened...

233
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,600
I should be here
making charcoal every day.

234
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,230
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

235
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,030
If none of this had happened...

236
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,990
If none of this had happened...

237
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,750
But I've lost them now.

238
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,960
I can never go back!

239
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,890
Big Bro!

240
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,890
Don't leave us behind!

241
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,310
Sorry!

242
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,110
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

243
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,570
We can't be together anymore.

244
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,030
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

245
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,790
I'll be thinking of you all!

246
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,670
There are lots of things to thank you for.

247
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,960
Lots of things to be sorry for!

248
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,760
But I will never forget you!

249
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,090
No matter what,
my heart will always be with you!

250
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,100
So, please...

251
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,600
forgive me!

252
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,280
I have to destroy
his spiritual core right away.

253
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,010
So, this is the inside of his heart?

254
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,510
How can it be so beautiful?

255
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,010
It's so endlessly vast...

256
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,980
and...

257
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,770
also warm.

258
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,320
They're having trouble, aren't they?

259
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,190
I wonder why.

260
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,320
They haven't destroyed
any of the spiritual cores yet.

261
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,580
Oh well...

262
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,080
I guess it doesn't matter,
since they're buying me some time.

263
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,090
Not here.

264
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,010
But I can smell a demon, faintly.

265
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,010
What's this, though?

266
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,090
It's like there's a film over everything!

267
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,970
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

268
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,100
I can't tell the exact location!

269
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,140
I have to hurry!

270
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,730
Nezuko's bleeding!

271
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,860
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

272
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,860
What should I do?

273
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,910
Am I unable to use
Total Concentration Breathing now?

274
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,370
Am I just asleep right now?

275
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,620
Tanjiro...

276
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,840
Take up your sword.

277
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,670
There's something you must cut.

278
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,810
There's something...

279
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,310
I must cut.

280
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,780
There's something I must cut...

281
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,820
in order to wake up.

282
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,450
I think I know what it is.

283
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,870
But what if I'm wrong?

284
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,960
If what happens in this dream
has an effect on reality, too...

285
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,170
there'll be no going back.

286
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,960
Don't hesitate! Do it!

287
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,590
You have to do it!

288
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,880
My death in this dream
will lead me to reality!

289
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,180
In other words...

290
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,300
what I have to cut is...

291
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,310
my own neck!

292
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,040
Good job preparing yourself for all this.

293
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,910
It's because of what you always told me.

294
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,380
Even if you're in anguish,

295
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,300
try to be a graceful and strong person
who can feel love for other humans.

296
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,680
All those people suffering at the hands
of the demons... Nezuko... Take care of them...

297
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,140
Tanjiro.

298
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,810
I'm going to give it my all, Father!

299
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,810
Next, Episode 4, "Insult."

300
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,140
